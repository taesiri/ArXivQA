# [What's the Problem, Linda? The Conjunction Fallacy as a Fairness Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09535)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper revisits the famous "Linda Problem" experiment by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. The Linda Problem illustrates the conjunction fallacy, where people incorrectly judge a specific conjunction ("Linda is a bank teller and active feminist") as more probable than one of its constituents ("Linda is a bank teller"). The effectiveness of the Linda Problem relies on evoking stereotypical representations of Linda as a woman. As AI researchers increasingly draw from cognitive psychology to develop human-like AI systems, the authors argue it is important to examine the societal assumptions and biases underlying human decision heuristics like the representativeness heuristic that drives the Linda Problem. Neglecting these biases risks perpetuating them in AI systems.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a "structural causal perception" framework to formally model differences in perception and interpretation as an inherent part of decision problems. This involves defining a "representative receiver" to capture the conceptual associations and operational links a decision-maker makes in interpreting information provided by a "sender". These conceptualizations and operationalizations allow defining structural "delta-adjustments" to the provided causal graph to model how additional perceptions affect decision outcomes.  

Revisiting the Linda Problem, the authors show how stereotypical perceptions of gender can formally explain the conjunction fallacy, asadjustments to the probabilities based on the receiver's biased conceptualization of what it means to be an "active feminist". An example admission system is also analyzed to demonstrate using the framework to state potential unfairness from different perceptual interpretations of the same applicant features.

Contributions:
1) Re-formulates the Linda Problem as an algorithmic fairness issue arising from societal stereotypes and representations.
2) Proposes a conceptual framework based on structural causal models to formally incorporate perception as a parameter in decision problems. 
3) Provides tools to explicitly state assumptions leading to potential unfairness in algorithmic systems from different interpretations of the same information.

The paper contributes an important perspective on the need to carefully examine human biases when using insights from psychology to develop human-like AI. The proposed framework offers a way to transparently surface differing assumptions and perceptions that should be considered in building fair sociotechnical systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper revisits the famous Linda problem that demonstrates the conjunction fallacy in human judgment, framing it through the lens of algorithmic fairness by formally modeling the role of perception and stereotypes using structural causal models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a conceptual framework, called the "structural causal perception framework", to formalize the role of perception as a parameter in fairness problems. Specifically:

1) The paper revisits the famous "Linda Problem" experiment in psychology and formulates it as a causal fairness problem using structural causal models. It argues that the problem illustrates how biases in human decision-making often center around protected attributes like gender. 

2) The paper examines the role of differing perceptions or interpretations of information as a key parameter. It introduces concepts like "senders" and "receivers" of information, and the idea of a $\delta$-adjustment to model differences in perception.

3) The paper proposes the "structural causal perception framework" involving three key components: a conceptualization mapping, an operationalization mapping, and a representative receiver. Together these allow formally stating differing perceptions and incorporating them into fairness problems.

4) The framework is illustrated via an example of a university admissions decision scenario involving candidates from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The framework helps state potential unfairness issues arising from differing perceptions.

In summary, the key contribution is a conceptual framework to make perception and its role more tangible in algorithmic fairness problems. The paper argues this is important for transparency and promoting dialogue across stakeholders.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "structural causal perception" framework. Can you explain in more detail what this framework entails and how it models perception as a parameter in fairness problems? 

2. The paper revisits the famous "Linda Problem" experiment through the lens of fairness. What is the key insight or argument made about the role of gender and stereotypes in the Linda Problem when viewed from an algorithmic fairness perspective?

3. The paper argues that the conjunction fallacy in the Linda Problem says more about the need to handle protected attributes like gender carefully when building automated decision systems. Can you expand on this argument? What are the implications?

4. The paper introduces the concepts of a "sender" and "receiver" of information to model differences in perception. How do these concepts relate to the proposed structural causal perception framework? What role do they play?

5. Can you explain in more detail the definitions provided for the conceptualization mapping Ω and the operationalization mapping Ψ? What do these mappings aim to capture and how do they fit into the overall proposed framework?

6. How does the paper propose to model additional structural adjustments introduced by differences in perception between agents? Explain the Δ set of adjustments and how they enter into the structural causal model.

7. What techniques does the paper suggest could be used to implement the proposed conceptual framework in practice when moving from conceptual ideas to actual implementation?

8. The illustrative example tackles a university admissions decision scenario involving two candidates from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Walk through how the structural causal perception framework is applied to this example.  

9. What are the limitations of the conceptual framework proposed in the paper? What challenges or open questions remain in progressing from the conceptual ideas to practical implementation?

10. How does the paper position itself within the broader literature on using concepts from psychology to build human-like AI systems? What novel perspective or contribution does it make in this area?
