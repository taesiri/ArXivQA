# [A privacy-preserving, distributed and cooperative FCM-based learning   approach for Cancer Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving and distributed approach for learning Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) using Federated Learning. FCMs are graphical models that represent concepts as nodes and relationships between concepts as weighted edges. 

The paper addresses the need for privacy-preserving machine learning models that can be trained in a distributed manner across multiple participants without sharing the underlying private data. This is especially important in sensitive domains like healthcare.

The main problem being addressed is how to learn an accurate FCM model in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner from datasets that are decentralized across multiple participants. 

The proposed solution is to use a Federated Learning approach where a central server coordinates the learning process between participants without accessing the private data. In each round, the central server sends an initial or aggregated FCM model to each participant. Then, the participants use particle swarm optimization to train the FCM on their local private dataset. Each participant only shares the trained FCM model or parameters back to the central server instead of the raw private data. The central server aggregates the trained FCM models from each participant to construct an improved global model, checks termination conditions, and repeats this process in a collaborative round-robin fashion.

The key contributions are:

- A novel methodology to train FCMs in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner using Federated Learning principles. This enables collaborative learning on decentralized private datasets.

- Compliance with data privacy regulations by not sharing the raw private data and only exchanging model parameters between the central server and participants.

- Improved accuracy compared to a single non-federated FCM and individual participant FCMs trained only on local data.

- Application to a cancer detection problem using a real-world medical dataset, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9383 which is comparable to state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, this paper puts forth an innovative federated learning framework for privacy-preserving distributed training of FCM models across participants owning sensitive and decentralized private datasets.
