# [Ask Optimal Questions: Aligning Large Language Models with Retriever's   Preference in Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational search extends information retrieval to dialog contexts, but has challenges due to conversational dependencies in questions (e.g. coreferences). 
- A common approach is "rewrite-then-retrieve", where a model generates self-contained questions before retrieval. But existing methods produce suboptimal rewrites as they don't fully utilize signals from retrieval results.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose RetPO (Retrieverâ€™s Preference Optimization), a framework to optimize a language model to produce query rewrites tailored to a target retriever's feedback.
- It first uses diverse prompting strategies to elicit potential rewrites from a large LM (GPT-4).
- It then gathers the retriever's feedback (retrieval performance) on each rewrite, constructing a dataset called RF Collection.
- Using this dataset, a smaller LM is fine-tuned and aligned to the retriever's preferences via direct preference optimization.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneers preference-driven optimization for query reformulation to align rewrites to a retriever's preferences.
- Constructs and releases RF Collection, a large dataset of 410K query rewrites with retriever feedback.
- Achieves new SOTA performance on QReCC and TopiOCQA benchmarks. Significantly outperforms baselines including GPT-3.5.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel framework RetPO that leverages retriever feedback to optimize query reformulation models, advancing state-of-the-art conversational search performance. The constructed dataset and analysis also provide useful insights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework called RetPO that optimizes a language model to generate query rewrites tailored to a target retriever's preferences, gathered through feedback on retrieval performance over 410K query candidates across 12K conversations, achieving state-of-the-art results on two conversational search benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a novel framework called RetPO (Retriever's Preference Optimization) to optimize a language model for reformulating search queries to align with the preferences of target retrieval systems. 

2) They construct and release a large-scale dataset called RF Collection containing over 410K query rewrites refined for search purposes across 12K conversations. This dataset contains retrievers' feedback on the performance of different query candidates.

3) They show that by optimizing a 7 billion parameter language model (Llama2-7b) on this dataset using techniques like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, they are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on two conversational search benchmarks - QReCC and TopiOCQA. Their model outperforms strong baselines including GPT-3.5.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) A new method RetPO for optimizing query reformulation models based on retriever feedback (2) RF Collection dataset (3) State-of-the-art results by optimizing Llama2-7b on conversational search tasks using RetPO framework and RF Collection dataset.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Conversational search - The paper focuses on improving conversational search through query reformulation. This involves search in a conversational context rather than single-turn queries.

- Query reformulation - A key aspect of the paper is using language models to reformulate conversational queries to make them clearer and more useful for retrieval. Terms like "rewrite-then-retrieve" and decontextualization are relevant here.  

- Retriever preference optimization (RetPO) - This is the proposed framework to optimize language models to produce queries tailored to a target retrieval system's preferences, rather than human judgments.

- Retrievers' feedback collection - The paper introduces a dataset collected based on retrieval performance feedback on query candidates to train models based on retriever preferences.

- Direct preference optimization (DPO) - A technique used to fine-tune the language model on the constructed dataset to align it with the retriever's preferences between queries.

- Evaluation benchmarks - The models are evaluated on conversational search benchmarks like QReCC and TopiOCQA.

In summary, the key themes are improving conversational search through query reformulation optimized for retrieval systems rather than humans, using retailer preference feedback. The terms cover the proposed techniques like RetPO and DPO, the dataset created, and benchmarks used.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new framework called RetPO (Retriever's Preference Optimization). Can you explain in detail the key components and steps involved in RetPO? What is the motivation behind this approach?  

2. One of the key ideas in RetPO is optimal query exploration using different prompting methods like question rewriting, planning, and query expansion. Can you analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method and why a combination of methods is used?

3. The paper constructs a dataset called RF Collection containing retrievers' feedback on query rewrites. What is the significance of this dataset? How is it used to optimize the language model?

4. Explain the concept of direct preference optimization used to align the language model with the retrievers' preferences. Why is this method preferred over other alignment techniques? What are its limitations?

5. How robust is RetPO in handling topic shifts within dialogues as compared to other baselines? What adaptations make it more effective for topic-shifted queries?

6. The paper demonstrates superior performance over baselines like GPT-3.5. Analyze the key factors that contribute to RetPO's effectiveness - is it mostly due to scale or the preference-based optimization or both?

7. One analysis reveals that RetPO generates longer, more detailed queries compared to human rewrites. How does this aspect contribute to or hinder its retrieval performance? Are there any risks of over-specification?

8. Can the ideas from RetPO be extended to other language model optimization tasks beyond conversational search? What could be some potential applications?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on large language models. How do you think RetPO would perform with smaller or mid-sized LMs? Would that reveal any new insights?

10. Given that RetPO relies heavily on model prompting, how sensitive is it to changes in the prompting methods and formats? How can prompt engineering be improved to make RetPO more robust?
