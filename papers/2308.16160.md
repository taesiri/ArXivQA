# [Occ$^2$Net: Robust Image Matching Based on 3D Occupancy Estimation for
  Occluded Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16160)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform robust image matching for occlusion scenarios where parts of the scene are visible in one image but occluded in the other. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel occlusion-aware image matching method called Occ^2Net that can match not only visible points between two images, but also between visible points and occluded points. This allows it to establish correspondences even when there is significant occlusion.

The key hypothesis is that by modeling the 3D occupancy of the scene and the occlusion relationships between objects, the network can infer the matching location of points in occluded regions that are not directly visible.

So in summary, the paper focuses on the problem of occlusion in image matching, and hypothesizes that occlusion relations can be modeled via 3D occupancy estimation to enable matching of visible to occluded points.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes Occ^2Net, a novel occlusion-aware image matching algorithm that uses 3D occupancy to model the occlusion relations between objects and infer the location of matching points in occluded regions. 

- It combines an Occupancy Estimation (OE) module with an Occlusion-Aware (OA) module to enable visible-occluded matching using a coarse-to-fine structure with occupancy estimation.

- It demonstrates state-of-the-art pose estimation accuracy on both the real-world dataset ScanNet and the simulated dataset TartanAir, showing the effectiveness of matching occluded points.

In summary, the key innovation is using 3D occupancy modeling and estimation to achieve robust image matching performance in the presence of occlusions, which is a common challenge in many vision applications like SLAM. By matching occluded points in addition to visible points, the method improves accuracy over previous approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

The paper proposes Occ^2Net, a novel image matching method that uses 3D occupancy estimation to model occlusion relations between objects and infer matches in occluded regions to achieve robust pose estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on real and simulated indoor/outdoor datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on occlusion-aware image matching:

- Most prior work in image matching focuses on matching between visible points, while this paper proposes matching occluded points to visible points. Matching occluded points is a relatively new idea that hasn't been explored much before. 

- This paper introduces a novel network architecture Occ^2Net that combines coarse-to-fine matching with 3D occupancy estimation to enable visible-occluded matching. The framework of using coarse attention-based matching plus fine matching with 3D reasoning is novel.

- For 3D reasoning, this paper uses a learned implicit 3D representation through occupancy estimation. Other recent works like NeuS (Wang et al. ICCV'21) and IBRNet (Chen et al. CVPR'21) also explore learned 3D representations for novel view synthesis across large baselines. This paper tailors the idea for the different goal of occlusion-aware matching.

- Compared to classic feature-based methods like SIFT/SuperGlue, this work follows recent trends in end-to-end dense matching like LoFTR and transformers. The competitive results validate these are promising directions. 

- For evaluation, this paper uses standard pose estimation benchmarks on ScanNet and TartanAir. The experiments focus on occlusion cases and demonstrate superior robustness compared to other state-of-the-art matching methods.

In summary, this paper pushes forward occlusion-aware dense image matching through a novel architecture leveraging ideas like attention, implicit 3D reasoning, and coarse-to-fine matching. The problem formulation and methodology seems innovative compared to related work in dense matching or novel view synthesis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing methods to handle more complex occlusion scenarios with multiple layers of occlusion. The current method models occlusion between two views using a simplified ray with one visible point and one occluded point. The authors suggest exploring more complex occlusion relationships like multiple points along each ray.

- Improving the accuracy of estimating the exact location of occluded matching points. The paper mentions it is challenging to accurately infer the location of occluded points due to limited data and errors in occupancy estimation. More advanced techniques could be developed to refine the position estimates.

- Applying the occlusion-aware matching to other tasks like novel view synthesis, object detection, etc. The authors propose the matching algorithm in the context of pose estimation but it could potentially benefit other applications as well.

- Exploring occlusion relationships and matching in video data with temporal information. The current method matches pairs of images, but video introduces additional cues like object motion that could be leveraged.

- Evaluating on datasets with more complex indoor and outdoor scenes to further demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the approach.

- Developing unsupervised or self-supervised methods to avoid reliance on ground truth pose and depth data during training. 

- Combining ideas from occlusion-aware matching with transformer-based dense matching architectures for further performance gains.

In summary, the key future directions are handling more complex occlusion scenarios, improving localization of occluded points, applying the idea to other tasks and data, and reducing the reliance on ground truth supervision during training. Advancing research in these areas could lead to even more robust matching algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Occ2Net, a novel image matching method that can handle occlusion by modeling 3D occupancy and inferring matches in occluded regions. The method uses a coarse-to-fine approach with an Occlusion-Aware (OA) module for coarse matching between image patches, and an Occupancy Estimation (OE) module that combines fine image features with estimated 3D occupancy to enable matching between visible and occluded points. The OA module applies self/cross-attention and rotation alignment to match patches robustly. The OE module estimates a 4D occupancy volume from image features, then combines this with fine image features to infer occluded matching points based on surrounding context. Experiments on the real-world ScanNet dataset and synthetic TartanAir dataset demonstrate that Occ2Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, especially in high occlusion scenarios, showing its ability to match points robustly even when they are occluded in one view. Key innovations are the use of estimated 3D occupancy to reason about occlusion, and a coarse-to-fine architecture tailored for occlusion-robust matching.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Occ2Net, a novel image matching method that can match occluded points between images in addition to visible points. The method uses a coarse-to-fine framework with two main modules:

Paragraph 1:
The Occlusion Aware (OA) module performs coarse matching between image patches. It uses attention mechanisms and a rotation alignment technique to match patches even when one patch is partially occluded. This allows matching of both visible-visible and visible-occluded patch pairs. 

The Occupancy Estimation (OE) module then refines the patch matches to get pixel-level correspondences. It estimates a 3D occupancy field for each image and combines this with fine-level image features. The occupancy helps infer locations of occluded points based on surrounding visible content. This enables matching visible points to their corresponding occluded points.

Paragraph 2:  
The method is evaluated on the real-world ScanNet dataset and the synthetic TartanAir dataset. It outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on pose estimation, especially in cases with heavy occlusion. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the proposed modules.

The key ideas are modeling occlusion relations using estimated 3D occupancy, and matching visible points to corresponding occluded points. This improves robustness in occlusion scenarios compared to prior image matching methods. The coarse-to-fine framework with tailored modules for coarse occlusion-aware patch matching and fine occlusion reasoning is effective.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Occ^2Net, a novel image matching method that can match points between images even when some points are occluded. The key ideas are:

1) Model occlusion relations using estimated 3D occupancy. By estimating the 3D occupancy of the scene, the method can infer the location of matching points even if they are occluded in one image. 

2) Use a coarse-to-fine matching structure. A coarse matching module matches image patches first. Then a fine matching module combines the patch matching results with 3D occupancy estimates to infer occluded matching points.

3) Introduce an occlusion-aware module with attention and rotation alignment. This aligns features between images to handle viewpoint changes and occlusions.

4) Match not just visible points but also between visible and occluded points. By matching occluded points inferred from the 3D occupancy, the method is more robust to occlusions.

In summary, the main novelty is using estimated 3D occupancy to enable matching occluded points, within a coarse-to-fine architecture designed to be occlusion-aware. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on pose estimation, especially under occlusion.
