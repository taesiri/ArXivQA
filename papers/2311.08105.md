# [DiLoCo: Distributed Low-Communication Training of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08105)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a distributed optimization algorithm called DiLoCo that enables training of large language models on multiple devices with low bandwidth connectivity between them.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes DiLoCo, a distributed optimization algorithm for training large language models when devices are not co-located and have low bandwidth connectivity. DiLoCo is based on federated averaging, where models are trained independently on local data shards and periodically synchronized. The key aspects of DiLoCo are using AdamW for the inner optimizer, Nesterov momentum for the outer optimizer, and performing a large number of local steps (e.g. 500) between synchronizations to reduce communication. Experiments on the C4 dataset with transformer models up to 400M parameters show DiLoCo converges faster than synchronous training in terms of wall clock time and matches or exceeds its accuracy, despite communicating 500x less. DiLoCo is robust to non-IID data, number of workers, and availability of resources over time. The approach enables distributing training across poorly connected accelerators.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes DiLoCo, a distributed low-communication algorithm for training large transformer language models when devices are not tightly interconnected. DiLoCo is based on federated averaging, using AdamW as the inner optimizer for local model updates and Nesterov momentum for the outer updates to synchronize models globally. Each local model performs many inner update steps (e.g. 500) before synchronizing, enabling 500x less communication versus standard training. Experiments on C4 show DiLoCo achieves lower perplexity than baseline synchronous training, is robust to non-IID data shards and communication frequency, and can gracefully handle dynamic resources. Overall, DiLoCo provides an effective way to distribute language model training across loosely connected devices, overcoming infrastructure bottlenecks in scaling up model training. The approach could likely generalize to other models and domains beyond the language modeling results shown.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a distributed optimization algorithm called DiLoCo that enables efficient training of large language models across multiple devices with low communication bandwidth by performing local optimization on each device for many steps before synchronizing.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How can we effectively train large language models in a distributed manner when the devices are poorly connected?

The key points are:

- Training large language models typically requires a large number of tightly interconnected devices that frequently exchange gradients and intermediate states. This poses challenges in infrastructure and engineering.

- It may be easier to have several smaller clusters of devices, rather than one giant cluster, but these clusters may be poorly interconnected. 

- The paper proposes a distributed training algorithm called DiLoCo that enables training large language models across multiple clusters with minimal communication between clusters. 

So in summary, the paper focuses on how to train large language models in a distributed way that does not require frequent communication between devices, allowing the use of multiple clusters with poor interconnectivity. The main hypothesis is that their proposed DiLoCo algorithm can achieve this.
