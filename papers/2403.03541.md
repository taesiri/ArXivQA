# [Seamless Virtual Reality with Integrated Synchronizer and Synthesizer   for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data scarcity in real-world environments leads to incomplete training datasets for autonomous driving (AD) systems, especially for critical scenarios like crashes. 
- Virtual simulation can generate more diverse data but has non-negligible gaps from real-world data.
- Existing virtual reality aided driving (VRAD) methods have limitations like low-frequency colocation, incomplete interaction, and lack of joint optimization between data collection (synchronizer) and data processing (synthesizer). These limitations cause virtual reality (VR) inconsistency and degraded data fidelity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a seamless VR (SVR) platform with an integrated synchronizer and synthesizer (IS2) design.
- IS2 consists of:
  - Lidar-inertial synchronizer (LIS): Accurately maps vehicles between real and virtual worlds using lidar, IMU and optimization. Achieves high 50Hz frequency.
  - Deep visual synthesis network (DVSN): Registers and fuses virtual foreground objects into real background images to generate augmented reality training images.

- SVR platform built on top of IS2 collects interactive driving datasets with vehicles-in-the-loop in VR space. Used to train imitation learning (IL) network.

Main Contributions:
- Drift-aware LIS for cm-level VR colocation accuracy to enable smooth vehicle interaction between real and virtual worlds
- Motion-aware DVSN for automatic VR image calibration and segmentation before fusion, minimizing image deviations
- Demonstration of SVR platform reducing interventions, missed turns and collisions for VR-trained IL network
- Analysis of performance gain brought by high-fidelity SVR data to IL network
- Validation on car-like robots and passenger vehicles in real, virtual and SVR spaces
