# [Seamless Virtual Reality with Integrated Synchronizer and Synthesizer   for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data scarcity in real-world environments leads to incomplete training datasets for autonomous driving (AD) systems, especially for critical scenarios like crashes. 
- Virtual simulation can generate more diverse data but has non-negligible gaps from real-world data.
- Existing virtual reality aided driving (VRAD) methods have limitations like low-frequency colocation, incomplete interaction, and lack of joint optimization between data collection (synchronizer) and data processing (synthesizer). These limitations cause virtual reality (VR) inconsistency and degraded data fidelity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a seamless VR (SVR) platform with an integrated synchronizer and synthesizer (IS2) design.
- IS2 consists of:
  - Lidar-inertial synchronizer (LIS): Accurately maps vehicles between real and virtual worlds using lidar, IMU and optimization. Achieves high 50Hz frequency.
  - Deep visual synthesis network (DVSN): Registers and fuses virtual foreground objects into real background images to generate augmented reality training images.

- SVR platform built on top of IS2 collects interactive driving datasets with vehicles-in-the-loop in VR space. Used to train imitation learning (IL) network.

Main Contributions:
- Drift-aware LIS for cm-level VR colocation accuracy to enable smooth vehicle interaction between real and virtual worlds
- Motion-aware DVSN for automatic VR image calibration and segmentation before fusion, minimizing image deviations
- Demonstration of SVR platform reducing interventions, missed turns and collisions for VR-trained IL network
- Analysis of performance gain brought by high-fidelity SVR data to IL network
- Validation on car-like robots and passenger vehicles in real, virtual and SVR spaces


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a seamless virtual reality platform with an integrated synchronizer and synthesizer to generate high-fidelity augmented reality data for training autonomous driving systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a drift-aware lidar-inertial synchronizer (LIS) to accurately map autonomous vehicles in the real world and adversarial obstacles in the virtual world to a shared/symbiotic world.

2. Proposing a motion-aware deep visual synthesis network (DVSN) to automatically calibrate and segment objects from virtual images for seamless fusion with real images. 

3. Implementation of the proposed seamless virtual reality (SVR) system and demonstration of its effectiveness in improving performance of imitation learning (IL) for autonomous driving. The SVR-trained IL model reduces interventions, missed turns and collisions compared to benchmarks.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed SVR system with integrated synchronizer and synthesizer (IS^2) design to achieve high fidelity virtual-real interaction for augmenting autonomous driving datasets and improving models.
