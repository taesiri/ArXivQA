# [CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07922)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key research contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing CodeT5+, a new family of encoder-decoder foundation models for code intelligence. CodeT5+ enhances flexibility to support both code understanding and generation tasks through a mixture of pretraining objectives and model components that can be dynamically combined. 2. A novel pretraining strategy with objectives like span denoising, causal LM, contrastive learning, and text-code matching on both unimodal and bimodal corpora. This enables learning rich representations from code and bridging the pretrain-finetune discrepancy.3. A compute-efficient training scheme to scale up CodeT5+ by initializing it with off-the-shelf LLMs like CodeGen. This allows training only a small number of additional parameters.4. Extensive experiments on over 20 code intelligence benchmarks evaluating CodeT5+ in diverse settings - zero-shot, finetuning, and instruction tuning. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on tasks like code generation, completion, math programming, and text-to-code retrieval.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed CodeT5+ framework with its flexible architecture, mixture of pretraining objectives, and compute-efficient training can advance the state-of-the-art in code intelligence across both understanding and generation tasks. The comprehensive experiments provide evidence to validate this hypothesis.
