# [CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07922)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key research contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing CodeT5+, a new family of encoder-decoder foundation models for code intelligence. CodeT5+ enhances flexibility to support both code understanding and generation tasks through a mixture of pretraining objectives and model components that can be dynamically combined. 2. A novel pretraining strategy with objectives like span denoising, causal LM, contrastive learning, and text-code matching on both unimodal and bimodal corpora. This enables learning rich representations from code and bridging the pretrain-finetune discrepancy.3. A compute-efficient training scheme to scale up CodeT5+ by initializing it with off-the-shelf LLMs like CodeGen. This allows training only a small number of additional parameters.4. Extensive experiments on over 20 code intelligence benchmarks evaluating CodeT5+ in diverse settings - zero-shot, finetuning, and instruction tuning. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on tasks like code generation, completion, math programming, and text-to-code retrieval.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed CodeT5+ framework with its flexible architecture, mixture of pretraining objectives, and compute-efficient training can advance the state-of-the-art in code intelligence across both understanding and generation tasks. The comprehensive experiments provide evidence to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the key contributions of this paper:- Proposes CodeT5+, a new family of encoder-decoder code foundation language models that can flexibly operate in different modes (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) to support diverse code intelligence tasks.- Introduces a mixture of pretraining objectives including span denoising, causal LM, contrastive learning, and text-code matching on both unimodal code data and bimodal text-code data. This helps learn rich representations to bridge the pretrain-finetune discrepancy.- Scales up CodeT5+ efficiently by initializing encoder and decoder with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs and only training a shallow encoder plus cross-attention layers. This "shallow encoder + deep decoder" design reduces trainable parameters.- Explores instruction tuning on CodeT5+ with synthetic prompts to align models with natural language instructions and improve few-shot generalization.- Achieves SOTA results on 20+ code intelligence benchmarks covering understanding and generation tasks. The instruction-tuned CodeT5+ model obtains 35.0% pass@1 on HumanEval surpassing prior open-source LLMs.- Showcases CodeT5+ as a flexible retrieval-augmented generator that significantly outperforms pipelines with separately trained retriever and generator modules.In summary, the key contribution is proposing CodeT5+, a flexible and scalable family of encoder-decoder foundation models for diverse code intelligence tasks, enabled by a diverse mixture of pretraining objectives and efficient scaling techniques. The models and training techniques lead to new SOTA results on various code understanding and generation benchmarks.
