# [Enhancing the Accuracy of Predictors of Activity Sequences of Business   Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05560)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for predicting the remaining sequence of activities in ongoing cases of business processes (called case suffixes) often generate repetitive patterns of activities that are not actually present in the real process data. This affects both the accuracy of predicting the sequence of activities (control-flow accuracy) as well as the prediction of timestamp information (temporal accuracy).

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a new sampling approach called "Daemon Action" to select the next activity when predicting case suffixes. 
- The key idea is to balance exploitation (picking likely activities based on probability) and exploration (trying less common activities) when sampling the next activity instance. 
- This is achieved by modifying the sampling probability to account for both the model's predicted probability and the historical frequency of each activity. 

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of the Daemon Action sampling approach to strike a balance between exploitation and exploration when predicting case suffixes.
- Enhancement of different LSTM architectures with the Daemon Action approach for next activity prediction.
- Experimental evaluation on 15 real-life event logs showing that the Daemon Action approach leads to:
  - Fewer spurious repetitive activities compared to baselines
  - Improved control-flow accuracy of predicted sequences
  - Comparable temporal accuracy to baselines
- The benefits are more pronounced for processes with larger vocabularies and longer case lengths.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel sampling technique called Daemon Action that balances exploitation and exploration to enhance sequence predictions for remaining activities in business processes. Experiments demonstrate improved control-flow accuracy relative to baseline approaches.
