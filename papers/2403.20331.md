# [Unsolvable Problem Detection: Evaluating Trustworthiness of Vision   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20331)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Definition:
- The paper introduces a new challenge called "Unsolvable Problem Detection" (UPD) to evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of Vision Language Models (VLMs). 
- UPD examines the ability of VLMs to withhold answers when faced with unsolvable problems in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks.
- UPD encompasses 3 distinct settings:
    1) Absent Answer Detection (AAD): Correct answer is absent from provided choices
    2) Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD): Answer set is irrelevant to context
    3) Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD): Question is irrelevant to image

Proposed Solution:
- New benchmarks created from MMBench for the 3 UPD settings: MM-AAD Bench, MM-IASD Bench, MM-IVQD Bench
- Evaluation of 5 recent open-source VLMs on UPD: LLaVA, CogVLM, Qwen-VL-Chat, LLaVA-Next, Gemini-Pro, GPT-4V
- Exploration of prompt engineering strategies (additional options, instructions) as training-free solutions 
- Exploration of instruction tuning as a training-based solution  

Main Contributions:
- Formal definition of the novel Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD) challenge
- Development of benchmarks tailor-made for systematically evaluating UPD
- Extensive experiments revealing limitations of current VLMs on UPD
- Analysis and proposal of training-free and training-based solutions along with findings on their effectiveness
- The paper provides the basis and motivation for improving reliability and trustworthiness of future VLMs
