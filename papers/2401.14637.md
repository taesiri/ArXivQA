# [T-Rex: Text-assisted Retrosynthesis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14637)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrosynthesis prediction aims to identify reactants that can synthesize a given target molecule. It is important but challenging in chemistry. 
- Existing template-free approaches only use molecular graph structures, lacking ability to generalize to rare reactions and large molecules.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes T-Rex, a text-assisted retrosynthesis prediction approach using pre-trained language models like ChatGPT.
- Key ideas:
   1) Use ChatGPT to generate description of target molecule based on name
   2) Combine description with graph to identify candidate reaction centers 
   3) Re-rank candidates by generating descriptions of reactants and checking which ones best fit 
   4) Complete synthons using existing graph-to-graph models

Main Contributions:
- First work incorporating text from language models to assist retrosynthesis
- T-Rex framework with ranking and re-ranking of reactions centers using text
- Experiments show T-Rex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based models on two datasets 
- Ablation studies demonstrate importance of each component
- Analysis shows T-Rex can generalize to rare reactions and how text helps correct mispredicted centers

In summary, the paper presents a novel text-assisted retrosynthesis prediction approach T-Rex that achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The integration of textual descriptions from ChatGPT with molecular graphs is the main innovation that helps overcome limitations of previous graph-only methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes T-Rex, a novel retrosynthesis prediction framework that utilizes text descriptions of molecules generated by ChatGPT to assist graph-based models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing T-Rex, a novel text-assisted retrosynthesis prediction approach that exploits pre-trained text language models such as ChatGPT to assist in the generation of reactants. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) Proposing a two-stage approach where ChatGPT first generates a description of the target molecule to help identify candidate reaction centers, and then generates descriptions of the reactants to help re-rank the candidates.

2) Demonstrating that incorporating text descriptions from ChatGPT into graph-based retrosynthesis models (G2Gs) substantially improves performance on two standard datasets.

3) Showing that the full T-Rex model outperforms an ablation without the re-ranking stage, demonstrating the benefits of using ChatGPT to re-rank candidates.

4) Analyzing T-Rex variants and showing the importance of using high-quality text from ChatGPT rather than lower-quality alternatives.

5) Demonstrating the ability of T-Rex to generalize to rare reaction types better than baseline graph-only models.

In summary, the key contribution is using text from pre-trained language models to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in graph-based retrosynthesis prediction. This opens up new possibilities for using such models to advance computational chemistry.
