# [Addressing Social Misattributions of Large Language Models: An   HCXAI-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17873)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are very good at simulating roles and personas in conversations. However, there can be a mismatch between the roles/personas intended by the designers and the ones perceived by users. This leads to social misattributions.

- Social misattributions of LLMs can be risky, especially in sensitive contexts like mental health. For example, a user may see an LLM chatbot as an "empathetic therapist" when it is not designed for that role. This can lead to emotional manipulation, incorrect and dangerous advice, unwarranted trust in the system, etc.

Proposed Solution:  
- Extend the Social Transparency (ST) framework's 4W model to a 5W model by adding a "which" question: which social attribution is actually assigned to the LLM by designers vs which attribution is made by users. 

- Clarify appropriate vs inappropriate roles for LLMs through taxonomies of social attributions developed via participatory design.

- Dynamically detect misattributions in LLM conversations and warn users or refer them to the attribution taxonomy.


Main Contributions:
- Identified the novel problem of social misattributions of large language models
- Proposed adapting the Social Transparency framework to help address this issue 
- Suggested methods like attribution taxonomies and real-time misattribution detection to clarify intended vs perceived roles of LLMs

The key insight is that making the actual social capabilities of LLMs transparent can reduce cases where users assign inaccurate roles or traits to these AI systems, especially in risky contexts like mental health advice. The 5W model extension and mitigation strategies aim to bridge the gap between intended and perceived model attributes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes extending the Social Transparency framework's 4W model with a 5th "which" question to clarify the social attributions (i.e. roles and personas) assigned to and perceived for Large Language Models, in order to address risks like unwarranted trust and harm stemming from mismatches between designers' and users' attributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an extension to the Social Transparency (ST) framework to address the risks of social misattributions in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, the authors suggest:

1) Augmenting the ST framework's "4W model" of explanations (who, what, when, why) with a fifth "W question" - "which" - to clarify which social attributions (roles and personas) are actually assigned to an LLM by its designers vs which ones are perceived by users. 

2) Developing two methods to support answering this fifth question in practice: 

(a) Creating taxonomies of appropriate and inappropriate social attributions for LLMs in different contexts. 

(b) Implementing techniques to detect and prevent social misattributions by users dynamically during conversations with LLM-based applications.

The goal is to bridge the gap between LLM capabilities and user perceptions to promote the ethical and responsible development and use of LLM-based systems. This is especially important in sensitive contexts like mental health where misattributions can lead to issues like unwarranted trust, emotional manipulation, and dangerous behaviors.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes adding a 5th "W" question to the existing 4W model of social transparency. What specific new information would this additional question aim to provide? How might it help clarify the intended vs perceived social attributions of an LLM system?

2. The paper argues that taxonomies categorizing appropriate and inappropriate social attributions could guide users and prevent misattributions. What criteria should be used to determine if a social attribution is appropriate or not? Who should be involved in developing these taxonomies?  

3. The paper suggests participatory design methods could be used to develop social attribution taxonomies. What stakeholder groups should be involved? What perspectives might they contribute regarding the possible roles and personas of LLM systems?

4. The paper proposes dynamic detection of potential misattributions during user interactions. What kind of algorithmic approaches or indicators could detect when a user is likely misattributing capabilities or traits to an LLM? 

5. What potential unintended consequences might arise from warning users about suspected misattributions? Could warnings undermine trust or engagement? How might warnings be designed sensitively?

6. The paper focuses specifically on risks from social misattributions of LLMs in sensitive domains like mental health. What other high-risk areas might need priority attention regarding misattributions? Why are LLMs prone to this issue?

7. The concept of "unwarranted trust" in LLMs is raised as a key risk. What constitutes warranted vs unwarranted trust in an AI system? What objective capabilities should ground warranted trust?

8. The paper argues LLMs cannot genuinely possess traits like empathy and care. Could these traits ever emerge in more advanced LLMs? What cognitive capabilities might be pre-requisites?  

9. What evaluation methods could empirically test the efficacy of the proposed taxonomy and misattribution detection approaches? What metrics determine success at preventing misattributions?

10. How might the ideas proposed here extend beyond just LLM systems? Could social transparency help address anthropomorphism and misattributions in other types of AI?
