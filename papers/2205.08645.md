# [Need is All You Need: Homeostatic Neural Networks Adapt to Concept Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08645)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether equipping an artificial neural network with homeostatic mechanisms for self-regulation can improve its ability to adapt to concept shift. Specifically, the authors investigate whether allowing a neural network classifier to homeostatically regulate its own learning rate helps it adapt to environments where the mapping between input data and labels changes over time. The key hypothesis seems to be that making the network "vulnerable" to its own classifications, by linking them to effects on its learning rate, provides an incentive for the network to classify accurately and adapt swiftly. This in turn allows it to maintain performance under shifting concepts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing a neural network architecture that incorporates homeostatic principles. The key ideas are:- The network is designed to be "needful" - it depends on the objects it classifies for its own integrity and functionality. For example, when classifying MNIST digits, some digits increase the network's learning rate while others decrease it.- The network can choose to "ingest" or reject a classified object, regulating its own learning rate. Accurate classification becomes important for the network's own well-being. - This "vulnerable" design allows the network to adapt to concept drift, where the mapping between labels and data changes over time. The homeostatic network outperforms regular networks under high rates of concept drift.- The network tunes its learning rate according to the amount of concept drift in the environment. It can also adapt to "second order" drift where the rate itself changes over time.- The design illustrates how an artificial agent can benefit from having "skin in the game" and being affected by the consequences of its own classifications. It connects neural computing to the biological principles of homeostasis and vulnerability.In summary, the main contribution is introducing a neural network architecture that incorporates homeostatic principles to improve adaptation to changing environments. The "needful" design exposes the network to the results of its own computations, incentivizing it to classify accurately and adjust its learning accordingly.
