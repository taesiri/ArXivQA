# [Need is All You Need: Homeostatic Neural Networks Adapt to Concept Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08645)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether equipping an artificial neural network with homeostatic mechanisms for self-regulation can improve its ability to adapt to concept shift. Specifically, the authors investigate whether allowing a neural network classifier to homeostatically regulate its own learning rate helps it adapt to environments where the mapping between input data and labels changes over time. The key hypothesis seems to be that making the network "vulnerable" to its own classifications, by linking them to effects on its learning rate, provides an incentive for the network to classify accurately and adapt swiftly. This in turn allows it to maintain performance under shifting concepts.
