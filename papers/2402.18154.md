# [Cutting Off the Head Ends the Conflict: A Mechanism for Interpreting and   Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) rely on internal memory to generate text, but this memory can be limited or outdated. Retrieval/tool augmentation provides external context to expand LMs' knowledge boundaries.
- However, internal memory and external context often contradict each other, causing knowledge conflicts within LMs.  
- There is limited understanding of the underlying mechanism behind these conflicts. Insights into the mechanism can enable targeted interventions to mitigate conflicts.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper reveals that inconsistent information flows integrated by certain attention heads in later layers are the pivotal point where knowledge conflicts emerge. 
- Specifically, some "memory heads" recall knowledge from internal memory, while "context heads" retrieve knowledge from external context. Their integration causes conflicts.
- Based on these insights, the authors propose a method called PH3 to efficiently mitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning the conflicting attention heads, without updating model parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an exploration into the mechanism of knowledge conflicts, identifying the pivotal role of memory and context heads.
- Proposes PH3 method to intervene on attention heads and flexibly control LMs to use internal memory or external context.
- Demonstrates PH3 can increase internal memory usage by 44.0% and external context usage by 38.5% across 8 LMs.  
- Shows cross-model, cross-relation and cross-format generalization ability of PH3.

In summary, the key innovation is revealing the mechanism behind knowledge conflicts and leveraging those insights to design a minimally invasive yet effective solution to control LM reliance on internal vs. external knowledge. The method displays strong generalization across models, relations and formats.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper reveals that knowledge conflicts in language models emerge from the integration of inconsistent information flows from memory and context attention heads in later layers, and proposes a method to mitigate conflicts by precisely intervening on these heads.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Performing an exploration into the mechanism of interpreting knowledge conflicts, and revealing that memory heads and context heads at later layers can cause knowledge conflicts when inconsistent information flows merge.

2. Proposing a novel method called Pruning Head via PatH PatcHing (PH3), which can efficiently mitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning those conflicting attention heads. 

3. Demonstrating that the proposed PH3 method can flexibly control language models to use internal memory (44.0% increase) or external context (38.5% increase). Also proving the cross-model, cross-relation, and cross-format generalization ability of the method.

So in summary, the key contributions are providing insights into the mechanism behind knowledge conflicts in language models, and developing a minimally invasive head pruning method to mitigate such conflicts and control model behavior. The method's effectiveness and generalization ability are also demonstrated.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Knowledge conflicts - The inconsistencies between a language model's internal parametric knowledge and external non-parametric knowledge provided through retrieval/tool augmentation. This causes clashes within the model.

- Internal memory - The factual knowledge memorized by a language model within its parameters during pre-training. This serves as the model's parametric knowledge base. 

- External context - Additional knowledge provided to the language model through retrieval augmentation or tool augmentation during inference. This serves as non-parametric knowledge.

- Memory heads - Attention heads in later transformer layers that recall factual attributes from the model's internal memory.

- Context heads - Attention heads in later transformer layers that extract factual attributes from the external context. 

- Merging inconsistent information flows - The integration of diverging information from memory heads and context heads is identified as the pivotal point where knowledge conflicts arise.

- Pruning heads via path patching - The proposed method which intervenes on conflicting attention heads through a path patching technique and structured pruning in order to mitigate knowledge conflicts.

So in summary, the key focus is on interpreting and resolving the clashes between internal and external knowledge in language models by targeting the specific attention heads involved. The pivotal role of memory and context heads merging inconsistent information is highlighted.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How exactly does the path patching technique allow for more accurate calculation of the importance score for target heads compared to the gradient-based method? What specifically does it do to isolate the target head?

2. When using path patching to identify important heads, what strategies or criteria can be used to determine the optimal corruption (e.g. replacing context attribute with <unk>) to apply to the input? 

3. How sensitive is the performance of PH3 to the choice of heads selected for pruning? Are certain heads more critical than others? How can we determine the most optimal set to prune?

4. Does the order in which heads are pruned impact performance? Should negative memory heads be pruned before negative context heads or vice versa? 

5. How well does PH3 generalize to other model architectures besides transformer networks? Could the concepts be applied to models like LSTMs or attention is all you need?

6. For real-world open domain QA tasks, how can PH3 be adapted to handle more complex context beyond simple factual statements? Does performance degrade?

7. What metrics beyond usage rate could be used to evaluate the impact of PH3? For example, does pruning heads impact model uncertainty or OOD detection ability? 

8. How does the performance of PH3 compare when using different criteria beyond gradient-based importance for head selection, like attention rollout or centering resonance analysis?

9. How does the induced sparsity from PH3 compare to intrinsic model sparsity? Does it align with existing structured or unstructured sparsity?

10. What scope exists for more non-destructive interventions like scaling head values as an alternative to pruning? How does this impact control over model preference?
