# [How Reliable Are Automatic Evaluation Methods for Instruction-Tuned   LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) often relies on automatic methods like ROUGE-L scores or judgments from other LLMs (e.g. GPT-3) rather than costly human evaluation. 
- Prior work found these automatic methods correlate well with human ratings on average, but their reliability across different tasks and languages is less studied.

Methodology:
- Analyze ROUGE-L and GPT-3's correlations with human ratings across 20 diverse tasks from Natural Instructions v2, translated to Swedish.
- Compare short answer vs free-form generation tasks and English vs Swedish.
- Train instruction-tuned models on cleaned Alpaca data and test on subsets of NIv2 tasks.
- Use 3 criteria for human evaluation on 3-point scale: naturalness, relatedness, correctness. Focus analysis on correctness.

Key Findings:
- Overall averages hide nuances - correlations vary strongly across tasks and languages. 
- ROUGE-L correlates highly with humans for short answer tasks but struggles with free-form generation. Issues arise from incomplete gold answers.
- GPT-3 as judge relies heavily on having gold answers available. Correlation drops significantly without.
- GPT-3 also over-penalizes deviations from gold answers in free-form generation tasks.

Conclusions:
- Automatic evaluation methods can reliably approximate human judgments but their efficacy is context-dependent. 
- Variations across tasks, languages, exact phrasing of gold answers impact reliability.
- More analysis needed on increasing GPT-3's correlation with humans for long free-form generation tasks.
- Guidelines established for appropriate usage of automatic methods.

Main Contributions:  
- In-depth analysis of reliability of ROUGE-L and GPT-3 as evaluators across diverse set of English & Swedish NIv2 tasks
- Identification of variability in correlations across task types and languages  
- Guidelines for using automatic evaluation methods appropriately based on task type


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the reliability of automatic evaluation methods like ROUGE-L and GPT-4 for assessing instruction-tuned language models across different tasks and languages, finding that while they can approximate human judgment under certain conditions, their efficacy varies significantly across contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a thorough analysis of the reliability of automatic evaluation methods such as ROUGE-L and GPT-4 for evaluating instruction-tuned language models across different tasks and languages. The key findings are:

1) While ROUGE-L and GPT-4 correlations with human ratings are solid on average, there is considerable variability across different task types. ROUGE-L works well for short answer tasks but struggles with free-form generation. GPT-4 relies heavily on gold label references which helps for short answers but can be too strict for open-ended tasks. 

2) The reliability of these automated methods drops significantly in the cross-lingual setting from English to Swedish, indicating conclusions don't necessarily transfer across languages. Issues like overgeneration have a greater negative impact.

3) The study provides guidelines regarding appropriate usage of automatic evaluation methods, noting they can approximate human judgment under certain conditions but efficacy is highly context-dependent. Task type, language, and gold label design can significantly impact reliability.

In summary, the main contribution is a nuanced analysis highlighting the variability in reliability of automatic evaluation methods across different tasks and languages along with insights to guide their effective usage. The findings help advance understanding of evaluating instruction-tuned models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper examines both monolingual and cross-lingual reliability of automatic evaluation methods like ROUGE-L and GPT-4. What are some key differences noted in the reliability of these methods when evaluating English tasks versus Swedish tasks?

2. When using GPT-4 as an automatic evaluator, what was the impact of including gold label references versus not including them? How did this affect GPT-4's alignment with human ratings and its tendency towards strictness or generosity?

3. For free-form text generation tasks, what issues were observed with using ROUGE-L for evaluation? How could the gold labels be designed better to improve reliability for such open-ended tasks? 

4. What role does task complexity and format play in affecting the reliability of automatic evaluation methods? How did short-answer versus long-answer tasks impact correlations observed with human ratings?

5. The paper notes issues arising from models over-generating or providing near-synonyms versus strict label matches. How could automatic evaluators be made more robust to account for acceptable variation in model responses?

6. What differences were noted in the optimal use of automatic evaluation methods for assessing correctness versus fluency or naturalness? Should these criteria be evaluated separately?

7. Could the noted variability across tasks and languages be addressed by better tailoring prompts for GPT-4? What cautions are necessary in prompt engineering to prevent bias?

8. For multilingual transfer scenarios, what implications does the analysis have for determining if poor performance stems from translation issues versus model capabilities?

9. The paper focuses only on English and Swedish - what new issues might arise when extending analyses to typologically different languages? What role could pretrained multilingual models play?

10. What new human or automated annotation techniques could be explored to create larger and more diverse datasets for analysis across a greater variety of languages and tasks?
