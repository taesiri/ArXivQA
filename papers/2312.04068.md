# [Making Translators Privacy-aware on the User's Side](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04068)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a concise summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called PRISM for enabling users to preserve privacy when using machine translation systems. It is often unclear exactly how or to what extent data is protected by translation services. Even with claimed privacy measures, sensitive information may still be compromised. PRISM allows users to actively control and ensure data privacy themselves. 

The authors propose two versions - PRISM-R and PRISM*. PRISM-R provides formal privacy guarantees, while PRISM* achieves better translation quality at the expense of provable privacy. In practice, PRISM* is recommended in most cases. 

The core idea is to convert private sentences into non-sensitive versions before feeding them to the translator. Users locally store word substitutions to trace back the translation to the original sentence. This homomorphic-like encryption approach allows leveraging untrusted translators securely.

Experiments confirm PRISM effectively balances privacy protection and translation accuracy using real-world translators. The paper also introduces a novel evaluation protocol tailored to assessing user-side privacy for translation tasks. Overall, PRISM progresses privacy-preserving capabilities on the user side for machine translation.
