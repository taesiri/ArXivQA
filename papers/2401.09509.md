# [Exploration of Activation Fault Reliability in Quantized Systolic   Array-Based DNN Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed on FPGA-based hardware accelerators for efficiency and high performance. However, for safety-critical applications, there is a need to evaluate the impact of aggressive quantization techniques on reliability against hardware performance tradeoffs. 

- Specifically, the impact of quantization on the vulnerability of activations to transient faults needs more analysis, as previous works have focused more on weight vulnerabilities. Activations require less hardware footprint but are more dynamically changing values during inference.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a comprehensive automated framework to analyze the three-way tradeoff between quantization, reliability against activation faults, and hardware performance of FPGA DNN accelerators.

- The framework applies various quantization-aware training techniques to compress the DNN down to low precision integers like 4-bits. Fault injection simulates transient faults in activations during systolic array-based inference. Finally, the methodology generates an FPGA accelerator prototype to measure actual hardware utilization and latency.

- A novel lightweight technique is proposed to detect out-of-range activations and replace with min/max boundary values. This protects against fault propagation with lower overhead than full solutions like TMR.

Contributions:
- Fully automated toolflow for design space exploration of quantized FPGA DNN accelerators targeting safety-critical applications

- Analysis methodology covering impact of quantization on accuracy, activation fault reliability drops, and hardware performance 

- Novel low-overhead technique to protect quantized accelerators against activation faults and fault propagation

- Detailed experimental analysis on LeNet and AlexNet benchmarks, demonstrating the ability to find optimal tradeoff points customizing for reliability or hardware efficiency

In summary, the paper enables a holistic analysis to implement resilient ultra low-precision DNN accelerators meeting safety requirements of critical applications. The proposed methodology and protection technique fills an important gap in this domain.
