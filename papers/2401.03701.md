# [ExTraCT -- Explainable Trajectory Corrections from language inputs using   Textual description of features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03701)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of modifying robot trajectories based on natural language corrections from humans, in order to incorporate human preferences and intent. Prior works employ end-to-end methods to directly map language corrections to trajectory deformations. However, these methods have limited generalization capabilities when faced with new environments, objects, trajectories or language variations. Additionally, the lack of transparency in end-to-end models makes identifying and rectifying failures difficult.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a modular framework, ExTraCT, that separates the language interpretation and trajectory deformation steps. It generates textual descriptions of trajectory modification features which are scene-specific or scene-independent. Language corrections are grounded by computing semantic similarity between user utterances and textual descriptions of features using pre-trained language models. The matched feature is then used to deform the trajectory through a separate deformation module, improving generalizability.

Key Contributions:
1) A modular trajectory correction framework integrating language models and trajectory deformations without end-to-end training.
2) Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world comparing performance against end-to-end baseline method. The proposed method achieved higher accuracy and user preference of around 80%.  
3) Demonstrated versatility through application in two contexts - general manipulation tasks and assistive feeding. The framework's modularity and explainability enables easy customization across diverse applications.

In summary, the key insight is combining hand-crafted trajectory deformations and language modeling capabilities to improve performance and explainability without large-scale end-to-end training. The separation of language interpretation and trajectory modification also enhances generalizability and provides transparency for diagnosing failures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents ExTraCT, a modular framework that combines large language models and trajectory deformation functions to enable natural language corrections of robot trajectories, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to end-to-end methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a modular framework, ExTraCT, for generating explainable trajectory corrections from natural language inputs. The key aspects of the contribution are:

1) ExTraCT separates the problem of language understanding from trajectory deformation. It uses large language models (LLMs) to match user corrections to textual descriptions of features, then applies trajectory deformation functions based on the matched feature. This allows better generalization and interpretability compared to end-to-end methods.

2) ExTraCT generates scene-specific and scene-independent features and their textual descriptions online based on templates. This allows it to modify trajectories for new scenes and object configurations without retraining.

3) Through user studies in simulation and with a real robot arm, ExTraCT demonstrated higher accuracy and preference compared to the baseline end-to-end method LaTTe. About 80% of cases were rated better with ExTraCT.

4) ExTraCT's modular nature allows it to expand to new tasks easily, as shown through an application in assistive feeding. Failures can also be easily diagnosed and improved by expanding the textual description templates.

In summary, the main contribution is a transparent and interpretable framework for trajectory modifications from natural language that combines the strengths of LLMs and hand-crafted features to achieve better generalization without end-to-end training.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a modular framework that separates language understanding from trajectory deformation. How does this separation of concerns allow for more precise and context-aware robotic responses compared to end-to-end methods?

2. The paper defines scene-specific and scene-independent features for trajectory modification. How do scene-specific features, which depend on objects in the scene, allow the approach to generalize to different objects that are detected online?

3. Accuracy evaluation of deformed trajectories is done differently compared to prior works. Can you elaborate on the metrics used to evaluate cartesian changes versus object distance changes? How do these metrics better capture correctness compared to similarity metrics used in prior works?  

4. The paper analyzes failure cases for the baseline method LaTTe. Can you discuss some of the reasons why LaTTe struggles with object distance changes despite using pretrained BERT and CLIP embeddings? 

5. All failure cases with ExTraCT are attributed to incorrect feature mapping. What are some limitations of using sentence transformers for language understanding, and how can they be improved?

6. The effect of the size of textual description templates and phrase selection on performance is analyzed. How does this analysis demonstrate the explainability of the proposed approach and how performance can be improved by expanding phrases in the templates?

7. The proposed method is applied to an assistive feeding task by defining bite size and feeding speed features. How does this showcase the versatility of the framework to be tailored for diverse scenarios?

8. What are some ways the feature space and types of language utterances handled can be expanded in future work? Can you suggest any additional features and complexity of language that can be supported?

9. Bi-directional communication allowing the robot to ask for clarifications is suggested as future work. In what scenarios would this be useful, and how can it build trust in the interaction?

10. It is discussed that explicitly obtaining features for modification provides transparency compared to end-to-end methods. Can you suggest ways in which this transparency can help in transferring human preferences across different contexts in future work?
