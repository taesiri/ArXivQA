# [Bilateral Reference for High-Resolution Dichotomous Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- High-resolution dichotomous image segmentation (DIS) is challenging as it requires precisely segmenting complex and slender structures in images. 
- Existing methods fail to capture very fine details and structures.

Proposed Solution:
- A bilateral reference network (BiRefNet) with separate localization and reconstruction modules.

- The localization module uses a transformer encoder-decoder to get a semantic understanding and global localization of the target objects.  

- The reconstruction module has bilateral reference blocks with:
   - Inward reference: Unscaled original image patches combined with decoder features to retain high-resolution details 
   - Outward reference: Gradient maps provide supervision to focus attention on regions with finer details

- Training strategies like long training, region-level losses, multi-stage supervision to get high-quality segmentation maps.

Main Contributions:
- Bilateral reference framework using image patches and gradient maps as references to reconstruct fine details.
- Exploration of practical training strategies tailored for high-resolution segmentation.  
- State-of-the-art performance on 4 tasks - DIS, SOD, COD, and HRSOD across 13 benchmarks, demonstrating versatility of the method.
- Around 2.6-8% average improvements in metrics like S-measure over prior task-specific state-of-the-art methods.
- Potential real-world applications like crack detection and accurate object extraction.

In summary, this paper presents a bilateral reference network with practical training strategies to achieve state-of-the-art high-resolution dichotomous image segmentation, outperforming prior task-specific methods across several segmentation tasks and benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a bilateral reference network with separate localization and reconstruction modules for high-quality dichotomous image segmentation, using the original image patches as inward reference and gradient maps as outward reference to focus attention on fine details.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a bilateral reference network (BiRefNet) for high-quality dichotomous image segmentation (DIS). The network consists of a localization module and a reconstruction module with bilateral reference blocks. 

2. It introduces the concept of bilateral reference, which includes an inward reference using source images to provide high-resolution guidance, and an outward reference using gradient maps to focus attention on regions with fine details.

3. It summarizes several practical training strategies tailored for DIS tasks, including long training, region-level loss fine-tuning, multi-stage supervision, context feature fusion, and image pyramid inputs. These help improve performance and accelerate convergence during training.

4. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance of BiRefNet on multiple high-resolution segmentation benchmarks like DIS, HRSOD and COD. The average S-measure improvements are 8.0%, 2.6% and 7.4% respectively over previous best methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a novel bilateral reference network with specialized training strategies that achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple high-resolution segmentation tasks.
