# [Self-Feedback DETR for Temporal Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10570)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

What is causing the failure of dense attention mechanisms in DETR-based models for temporal action detection (TAD), and how can this issue be resolved?

The key points are:

- The paper identifies a problem they term "temporal collapse" in the self-attention modules of DETR-based models for TAD. 

- This temporal collapse leads the self-attention modules to play no effective role in the model, degrading performance.

- The paper proposes a new framework called Self-DETR that provides feedback to the self-attention modules from the encoder-decoder cross-attention. 

- This feedback guidance resolves the temporal collapse issue by retaining diversity in the self-attention and improving model performance.

So in summary, the main research question is identifying the cause of poor performance of DETR models in TAD (temporal collapse in self-attention), and proposing a solution (Self-DETR with self-feedback guidance) to address this issue.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies the temporal collapse problem of standard self-attention in DETR-based models for temporal action detection (TAD). It points out that the core issue lies in the self-attention modules of both the encoder and decoder. 

2. It proposes a new framework called Self-DETR that provides feedback to the self-attention modules from the encoder-decoder cross-attention to prevent temporal collapse. It uses the cross-attention maps to produce guidance maps for the encoder and decoder self-attention.

3. It demonstrates through experiments that Self-DETR effectively resolves the temporal collapse issue by maintaining high diversity in attention. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 and outperforms prior DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying the temporal collapse problem in self-attention for DETR-based TAD models, and proposing a simple yet effective Self-DETR framework to guide the self-attention using cross-attention maps to alleviate this problem. The improved performance verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on improving DETR-based models for temporal action detection (TAD), which is an important but challenging task for video understanding. Several other recent papers have also explored adapting DETR for TAD, but this paper points out a key issue with the self-attention mechanism in DETR models that hurts performance on TAD. 

- The paper clearly defines the "temporal collapse" problem they identify with standard self-attention in DETR models for TAD. Other papers have noted issues like over-smoothing, but this paper argues temporal collapse is more serious and fundamental. Their analysis and experiments back up this claim.

- To address the temporal collapse problem, the paper proposes a novel self-feedback framework to guide the self-attention modules using cross-attention. This differs from prior works that used deformable attention or other modifications to self-attention. The proposed method keeps the standard self-attention design but adds guidance.

- The experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet show state-of-the-art results for DETR-based models on TAD. The performance gains, especially on THUMOS14, demonstrate the effectiveness of the self-feedback approach compared to prior DETR modifications.

- Overall, a key contribution is comprehensively analyzing the issues with self-attention for DETR on TAD, identifying temporal collapse as the core problem, and addressing it with a simple but well-motivated self-feedback framework that achieves new state-of-the-art DETR performance. The insights and approach differentiate this work from related literature.

In summary, the paper provides useful analysis of limitations of DETR for TAD, proposes a novel solution targeting the core issue, and achieves strong empirical results demonstrating the impact of their approach compared to prior art. The work represents an advance in adapting DETR models for the important task of temporal action detection.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Improving performance on short action scales in ActivityNet dataset. The authors note that DETR-based methods still lag behind standard approaches on ActivityNet, likely because videos have fewer action instances and models tend to overfit to longer actions. Improving performance on short scales is noted as a key concern.

2. Expanding beyond standard attention mechanisms while retaining their benefits. The authors emphasize the importance of standard attention for avoiding inductive biases. However, they also note the limitations of standard attention for temporal action detection. Exploring new attention mechanisms that retain the strengths of standard attention is suggested. 

3. Applying the self-feedback approach to other transformer-based models. The authors show self-feedback can alleviate collapse in a recent DETR model. Applying self-feedback more broadly to enhance other transformer architectures is suggested.

4. Extending the self-feedback framework. The authors propose a simple but effective self-feedback approach to address temporal collapse. Building on this with more advanced guidance mechanisms or exploring complementary techniques is an area for exploration.

5. Adapting DETR-based models for other video understanding tasks. The authors focus on temporal action detection but note DETR has been adapted for other video tasks. Extending DETR advancements, like self-feedback, to related video problems could be impactful.

In summary, the main directions are improving performance on short actions, developing better attention models, extending self-feedback to other transformers, building on the proposed feedback approach, and adapting the DETR framework to new video analysis tasks. The authors lay the groundwork for many promising research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called Self-DETR to address the temporal collapse problem in self-attention modules of DETR-based models for temporal action detection (TAD). The authors discover that the self-attention maps in both the encoder and decoder of DETR models for TAD collapse to just a few key elements, degrading their capability. To solve this, Self-DETR utilizes the cross-attention maps between the encoder and decoder to produce guidance maps. These guidance maps provide feedback to the self-attention modules to prevent collapse. Specifically, guidance maps are obtained by matrix multiplication of the cross-attention map with its transpose, recovering relationships between encoder features and within decoder queries. Objectives are introduced to minimize the gap between guidance maps and collapsed self-attention maps. Experiments demonstrate that Self-DETR resolves the temporal collapse by maintaining diversity in attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 and outperforming prior DETR approaches on ActivityNet-v1.3.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called Self-DETR to address the temporal collapse problem in self-attention for DETR-based models applied to temporal action detection (TAD). The temporal collapse problem causes the self-attention modules in the encoder and decoder to focus on only a few key elements rather than capturing rich relationships between elements. This degrades the capability of the encoder and decoder. To solve this, Self-DETR utilizes the cross-attention maps from the decoder to provide guidance and feedback to the self-attention modules. It recovers the relationships between encoder features and within decoder queries through matrix multiplication of the cross-attention map and its transpose. This produces guidance maps that minimize the gap with the collapsed self-attention maps.  

The paper demonstrates through experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet that Self-DETR successfully resolves the temporal collapse problem by maintaining high diversity in the self-attention. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 over all previous methods. On ActivityNet, it outperforms prior DETR-based approaches and achieves results comparable to standard methods. The results validate that the proposed self-feedback mechanism effectively guides the self-attention modules to prevent collapse and learn expressive relationships for accurate temporal action detection.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Self-DETR to address the temporal collapse problem in the self-attention modules of DETR-based models for temporal action detection (TAD). Self-DETR is based on the DETR architecture but utilizes cross-attention maps from the decoder to provide feedback and reactivate the collapsed self-attention modules in both the encoder and decoder. Specifically, guidance maps are constructed for the encoder and decoder self-attention by calculating the matrix multiplication of the cross-attention map and its transpose. These guidance maps contain information about correlations between encoder features and decoder queries. Objectives are introduced to minimize the gap between the guidance maps and the collapsed self-attention maps. This allows the model to retain high diversity in the self-attention and resolve the temporal collapse issue. The self-attention modules can then play their proper role and enable precise localization and classification of action instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Self-DETR framework successfully addresses the temporal collapse problem and achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 while outperforming prior DETR-based approaches on ActivityNet-v1.3.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem that DETR-based models have not performed well for temporal action detection (TAD). Specifically, it points out an issue with the self-attention mechanism in DETR models when applied to TAD, which it refers to as the "temporal collapse problem."

The key points are:

- DETR models have recently been applied to TAD, but have not achieved strong performance compared to other methods.

- The authors identify that the standard self-attention mechanism in DETR suffers from "temporal collapse" when applied to TAD. This means the attention focuses on just a few key elements rather than distributing across all elements. 

- They argue this collapse of the self-attention degrades the capability of the encoder and decoder in DETR models for TAD, since their self-attention layers are not effectively modeling relationships.

- To address this, they propose a new framework called Self-DETR that uses the cross-attention between encoder and decoder to guide the self-attention and prevent this temporal collapse.

- Experiments show their method resolves the collapse by keeping high diversity in the self-attention, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the THUMOS14 dataset, outperforming prior DETR approaches on ActivityNet.

In summary, the key problem is the ineffectiveness of self-attention in DETR for TAD, and their solution is to use cross-attention guidance to improve the self-attention and prevent temporal collapse.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper points out the problem of "temporal collapse" in the self-attention of DETR for temporal action detection (TAD). Could you explain in more detail what is meant by temporal collapse and why it is problematic for TAD?

2. The proposed method, Self-DETR, utilizes cross-attention maps to provide feedback and guidance to the self-attention modules. Could you walk through the specific steps of how the guidance maps are constructed from the cross-attention and used for the self-feedback? 

3. The paper argues that the guidance from the cross-attention helps prevent "shortcut learning" in the self-attention modules. Can you expand on what kind of harmful shortcuts could occur and how the proposed method helps alleviate this?

4. The self-feedback is applied differently for the encoder and decoder modules. For the encoder, self-attention maps are aggregated before guidance, while for the decoder guidance is provided layer-by-layer. What is the motivation behind handling self-feedback differently for the encoder vs decoder?

5. How does the proposed method balance enforcing guidance from the cross-attention with still allowing diversity in the self-attention maps? Could forcing the self-attention to strictly match guidance be detrimental?

6. The paper shows that alternatives like relative attention or maximizing diversity do not work as well as the proposed cross-attention guidance. Why do you think the cross-attention provides better guidance compared to these other options? 

7. The performance gains of Self-DETR over prior DETR methods are more significant on THUMOS14 compared to ActivityNet. What differences between these datasets could explain the varied performance gains?

8. The paper validates that collapsed self-attention provides negligible benefits on its own. Does this imply that standard self-attention is not beneficial for TAD without the proposed guidance method?

9. Could the idea of providing cross-attention guidance be applied to transformer models in other domains suffering from attention collapse, beyond just TAD?

10. The paper focuses on settling self-attention collapse in DETR for TAD. What other major issues remain open in adapting transformers like DETR to temporal action detection?
