# [Self-Feedback DETR for Temporal Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10570)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: What is causing the failure of dense attention mechanisms in DETR-based models for temporal action detection (TAD), and how can this issue be resolved?The key points are:- The paper identifies a problem they term "temporal collapse" in the self-attention modules of DETR-based models for TAD. - This temporal collapse leads the self-attention modules to play no effective role in the model, degrading performance.- The paper proposes a new framework called Self-DETR that provides feedback to the self-attention modules from the encoder-decoder cross-attention. - This feedback guidance resolves the temporal collapse issue by retaining diversity in the self-attention and improving model performance.So in summary, the main research question is identifying the cause of poor performance of DETR models in TAD (temporal collapse in self-attention), and proposing a solution (Self-DETR with self-feedback guidance) to address this issue.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies the temporal collapse problem of standard self-attention in DETR-based models for temporal action detection (TAD). It points out that the core issue lies in the self-attention modules of both the encoder and decoder. 2. It proposes a new framework called Self-DETR that provides feedback to the self-attention modules from the encoder-decoder cross-attention to prevent temporal collapse. It uses the cross-attention maps to produce guidance maps for the encoder and decoder self-attention.3. It demonstrates through experiments that Self-DETR effectively resolves the temporal collapse issue by maintaining high diversity in attention. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 and outperforms prior DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3.In summary, the key contribution is identifying the temporal collapse problem in self-attention for DETR-based TAD models, and proposing a simple yet effective Self-DETR framework to guide the self-attention using cross-attention maps to alleviate this problem. The improved performance verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
