# [Temporal Link Prediction Using Graph Embedding Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of temporal link prediction in dynamic networks, with a focus on scientific co-authorship networks. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the collaboration structure between authors in future years, based on patterns of co-authorship in past years. Accurately predicting future collaborations in scientific communities can help form more productive research groups and improve research quality. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel temporal graph embedding approach that models each author as a "Newtonian object" with a location and velocity in the embedding space. The dynamics of authors are captured by computing velocity vectors based on change in position over time. An LSTM is used to predict future velocity and location, which determines proximity and hence likelihood of collaboration between authors.

Specifically, the steps are:
1) Embed author co-authorship graphs from each year using a temporal embedding method (AERNN)
2) For each author node, compute a velocity vector based on change in position over consecutive years 
3) Use LSTM to predict future velocity sequence for each author 
4) Compute predicted future location using current location and predicted velocity 
5) Predict likelihood of links between author pairs based on proximity of their predicted locations

 additionally:
- Velocity aggregation is done vertically (over time for a node) and horizontally (over neighbors) to capture temporal and network contextual dynamics
- Parameter analysis is done to study impact of embedding dimensions, time series length etc.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective of modeling nodes as Newtonian objects with velocity to capture dynamics
- Significantly outperforms baseline temporal embedding model for co-authorship prediction (17.34% AUROC increase)   
- Provides interpretability over traditional approaches through modeling of embedding trajectories
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard dataset compared to recent temporal link prediction techniques
- Approach is generalizable beyond co-authorship networks to other temporal prediction tasks

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in improving performance and explainability for the important problem of temporal link prediction, with very positive results on co-authorship network analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel temporal link prediction approach that defines nodes as Newtonian objects, computes their velocity in the embedding space across time, uses an LSTM to predict future velocity, and then predicts future links based on the predicted locations of nodes derived from the velocity predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method for temporal link prediction that defines nodes as Newtonian objects and incorporates the concept of velocity to predict network dynamics. Specifically:

1) The paper represents the dynamic network embedding of each node over time as a trajectory in a vector space. 

2) It calculates the velocity vector of each node based on changes in its position over time in the embedding space.

3) An LSTM model is used to predict the future velocity of each node.

4) The predicted future location of nodes is calculated using their current location and predicted velocity.

5) Future links between nodes are predicted based on the similarity of their predicted future locations.

By modeling velocity and using it to predict future locations and connections, the paper aims to improve both accuracy and explainability compared to standard temporal graph embedding techniques that model overall dynamics. Experiments on co-authorship data show a 17.34% AUROC improvement in predicting future collaborations compared to a baseline method.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper defines nodes as Newtonian objects and incorporates the concept of velocity to predict network dynamics. Can you expand more on why modeling nodes as objects with velocity helps improve link prediction compared to traditional approaches that focus on overall network dynamics?

2. The velocity prediction model uses a 3-layer LSTM. Can you explain why an LSTM architecture is well-suited for modeling and predicting the velocity sequences of nodes? What are the key advantages it provides?  

3. The paper utilizes both vertical aggregation (over time) and horizontal aggregation (over node neighbors) when predicting future node locations. What is the intuition behind using two separate aggregation schemes? How do they capture different useful information?

4. In the vertical aggregation, more recent velocities get higher weights. What is the rationale behind this weighted averaging? Does giving higher priority to recent dynamics help improve predictive performance?

5. The horizontal aggregation averages the initialized locations of one-hop neighbors. How does this capture the local network interactions for a node? Why are one-hop neighbors sufficient instead of considering a wider network neighborhood?

6. The dimensions of the embedding space, length of time series data, and recency of historical data used are key hyperparameters. What were the trends and optimal values identified for these hyperparameters in the experiments? 

7. How robust is the proposed method to different choices of hyperparameters based on the experiments? Does it require extensive tuning to achieve good performance?

8. The proposed method is evaluated on a PubMed co-authorship dataset. What modifications would be needed to apply it to other types of temporal graphs like communication networks or product co-purchase networks?

9. The concept of velocity is used to predict node locations and connections. Could other dynamics like acceleration also be incorporated to further improve predictive modeling? What challenges would this introduce?

10. The paper demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline Dynamic AERNN method. How could the proposed innovations of modeling velocity and local interactions be integrated into other state-of-the-art dynamic graph embedding techniques?
