# [CALM : A Multi-task Benchmark for Comprehensive Assessment of Language   Model Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12539)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can a reliable and robust dataset be created to quantify bias in language models across different tasks? 

2) Will this proposed dataset, called CALM, exhibit greater diversity and reliability compared to prior bias analysis datasets?

3) How does model performance in terms of bias differ across various prominent families of large language models when evaluated on the CALM benchmark? 

4) Is there a relationship between model size (number of parameters) and amount of bias within certain model families or series?

The authors motivate the need for more rigorous bias quantification datasets to assess fairness issues in increasingly large and capable language models. They argue that prior bias datasets suffer from lack of diversity, sensitivity to perturbations, and author bias. 

To address this, the authors introduce CALM - a new benchmark consisting of diverse templates sourced from existing datasets across three tasks: question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference.

The key hypotheses tested are that CALM will show greater reliability, diversity, and robustness compared to previous bias datasets. Furthermore, the authors hypothesize that model bias may increase with size for certain model families based on evaluation across the CALM benchmark.

In summary, the central focus is on creating a more comprehensive and robust bias benchmark, and using it to analyze model biases, especially across different model sizes and families.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing CALM, a benchmark dataset and set of procedures for quantifying bias in language models. Key features of CALM include:

- Constructing a diverse dataset using existing datasets across three tasks - question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. This results in 224 templates and 78,400 examples.

- Comparing CALM to prior bias datasets and showing it has greater template diversity in terms of semantic similarity and variance in template length. CALM is also shown to be more robust to perturbations.

- Evaluating 20 large language models on CALM, including 6 prominent families, and analyzing trends in bias with respect to model size and type. Larger models are found to be more biased for some families. 

- Proposing procedures and metrics focused on reliability and diversity of templates to advance bias quantification in language models.

So in summary, the main contribution is presenting a more comprehensive and reliable benchmark for evaluating sociodemographic bias in language models, to further research into mitigating this important issue. The design of the dataset, experiments, and procedures emphasize diversity, stability and standardized evaluation across models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents CALM, a new benchmark dataset and procedures for evaluating gender and racial bias across language models on three tasks - question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis; it compares CALM to prior bias analysis datasets, showing it has greater template diversity and robustness, and uses CALM to evaluate 20 large language models, finding larger models in some series exhibit more bias.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in the field:

- The paper presents a new benchmark dataset called CALM for evaluating bias in language models across three natural language tasks - question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. Other recent papers have proposed datasets for measuring bias, but the authors argue CALM provides greater template diversity and robustness compared to prior datasets. 

- A key contribution is the methodology of creating templates by extracting sentences containing names/pronouns from 16 existing datasets across the three tasks. Many prior works manually design templates, which can introduce author bias and reliability issues. Leveraging multiple external datasets seems to promote greater diversity.

- The paper examines bias trends across 20 major language models, evaluating models ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Most prior work evaluates fewer models, so analyzing results across multiple model families and sizes provides useful insights. 

- The bias quantification metric calculates differential accuracy between social groups and averages across tasks and bias categories. This differential accuracy approach is intuitive but relatively simple compared to some more complex aggregation schemes in related papers.

- For analysis, the paper focuses on gender and race bias for US-based names. Other recent work has aimed to quantify broader categories of bias, though covering additional domains leads to tradeoffs with scale.

- The comparison of CALM to other datasets on diversity metrics like semantic similarity and template length variation provides useful context on reliability advantages. Prior work such as UnQovering Bias also conducts template similarity analysis.

Overall, CALM seems to make valuable contributions around reliability and standardized comparison of different language models for bias. The template methodology and multi-task design seem like useful innovations compared to related benchmarks. More complex bias metrics could build on this data in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests the following key future research directions:

- Developing more comprehensive benchmark datasets and procedures to quantify bias in language models across different tasks and domains, including crowd-sourcing bias datasets. 

- Standardizing prompts and evaluation protocols for language models to enable controlled comparison.

- Studying the interplay between different types of sociodemographic bias (e.g. gender vs. racial bias) and how they are affected by increasing model size and training approaches.

- Improving techniques to mitigate bias during training while preserving model capabilities. Possible directions include adversarial training, data augmentation, and debiasing model embeddings.

- Exploring how biases manifest across modalities (text, image, etc) for multimodal models. Expanding bias evaluation to broader capabilities like reasoning.

- Establishing model cards and standardized test suites to disclose bias and enable auditing before deployment. Developing techniques to quantify uncertainty and fairness in model predictions.

- Understanding social biases embedded in language and how they propagate to models. Studying the co-evolution of datasets, models, and harm over time.

In summary, the key directions are creating better bias evaluation benchmarks, studying the roots and tradeoffs of different biases, developing bias mitigation techniques, and enabling transparency and auditing around model biases. The overall goal is to spur development of more equitable and socially-aware language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called CALM (Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias) for evaluating bias in language models across three tasks - question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. The key idea is to use existing datasets across these tasks to extract templates, then generate a large number of examples by substituting names associated with different gender and racial groups. This allows testing if language models exhibit bias towards certain groups. The authors generate 78,400 examples using 224 templates extracted from 16 datasets. Compared to previous bias analysis datasets, they show CALM has greater diversity in templates and is more robust to perturbations. The dataset is tested on 20 language models to quantify bias. The results indicate some models become more biased with increasing size, while others like the T0 series are relatively unbiased. The paper provides an important step towards reliable bias evaluation in language models. Overall, CALM enables standardized comparison of bias across models through its coverage of diverse tasks and social groups.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CALM, a new benchmark dataset and procedures to quantify bias in language models across three tasks - question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. The motivation is to develop more reliable tools for evaluating model bias compared to prior bias analysis datasets, which have been shown to be sensitive to small perturbations. 

CALM integrates templates from 16 existing datasets to construct a diverse corpus of 78,400 examples. Analysis shows CALM templates exhibit greater diversity in terms of semantic similarity and variance in length compared to other bias datasets. Robustness is demonstrated through stability of bias scores when syntactically modifying templates. The dataset is used to evaluate 20 large language models, finding certain models exhibit higher bias with increased parameters, while others like the T0 series show lower overall bias. The code and dataset are publicly released to provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating model bias across different social groups. The approach shows promise for developing more robust tools to quantify and compare model bias.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces CALM, a benchmark dataset and procedures for quantifying bias in language models across three tasks - question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. 

The key method used is integrating existing datasets across different domains to filter templates, then using the templates to generate a large dataset of examples. Specifically, the authors select 16 existing datasets for the three tasks and filter 224 templates from them. The templates contain placeholders like [PERSON] instead of actual names. Using 50 gendered names from each of three categories (male, female, non-binary) and 50 names from each of four racial categories (white, black, Hispanic, Asian), they generate 150 examples per template for gender analysis and 200 examples per template for racial analysis. This results in a total dataset size of 78,400 examples.

To create the templates, they filter examples from each dataset that contain person names or pronouns. They extract the templates by replacing the names with placeholders. The goal is to create diverse templates by leveraging existing datasets across different domains. They compare the diversity of the resulting CALM dataset using metrics like average semantic similarity of templates and variance in template length. The authors show CALM has more diversity than prior bias analysis datasets. They evaluate gender and racial bias for 20 large language models on CALM, using accuracy difference between groups as the bias score. The main finding is that for some model families, larger models exhibit more bias.

In summary, the key method is generating a diverse bias quantification dataset for multiple tasks by filtering templates from existing datasets across domains, then using the templates to construct a large set of bias evaluation examples. The goal is to create a more reliable and robust dataset compared to prior bias benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper presents a new benchmark dataset called CALM (Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model Bias) to quantify bias in language models across three tasks - question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference. The key issues it aims to address are:

- Prior bias measurement datasets are sensitive to small perturbations in their manually designed templates, making them unreliable. CALM integrates templates from 16 existing datasets to create a more diverse and robust set of examples.

- Previous bias datasets typically focus on only one task and have limited templates. CALM evaluates bias across three distinct tasks with a broad collection of 224 templates. 

- Other bias datasets rely heavily on templates designed by authors, introducing potential author bias. CALM filters templates from pre-existing datasets to avoid this issue.

- There is a need for standardized benchmark datasets to compare different language models and model versions in terms of bias. CALM provides a reliable tool for quantitative bias measurement and comparison across models.

- As multi-task models become more common, comprehensive bias testing across different skills becomes important. CALM assesses bias in three key natural language tasks.

In summary, the main focus is on creating a diverse, robust, and standardized benchmark for quantifying sociodemographic bias across different language models and tasks. This can support development of fairer models and analysis of bias trends.
