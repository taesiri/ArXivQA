# [Dual-path Frequency Discriminators for Few-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Dual-path Frequency Discriminators for Few-shot Anomaly Detection":

Problem:
- Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to detect anomalies using only a few (less than 8) anomaly-free source images. 
- Existing FSAD methods struggle to effectively leverage the limited normal samples and fail to detect subtle, inconspicuous anomalies, especially in the spatial domain.

Key Idea:
- The paper discovers that subtle anomalies become more noticeable when images are transformed to the frequency domain. 
- It proposes a dual-path frequency discriminators (DFD) network to tackle FSAD from a frequency perspective.

Methodology:
- Pseudo-anomalies are generated at both image-level and feature-level to facilitate training.
- Images are decomposed into multi-frequency components using downsampling and upsampling operations.
- A feature extractor and adaptor are used to obtain adapted features from the frequency components.  
- Dual-path discriminators, consisting of a Gaussian discriminator and Perlin discriminator, are employed to distinguish normal and anomalous features.
- The discriminators aim to learn a joint latent representation of normal and anomalous features.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a frequency perspective for few-shot anomaly detection by leveraging differences in frequency domains.
- Designs a pseudo-anomaly generation strategy and dual-path discriminators architecture.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD and VisA datasets, improving image-level AUROC by 1.3% and pixel-level AUROC by 1.2% on MVTec AD under 2-shot setting.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the main idea/solution proposed, the methodology and architecture design, and the primary contributions of the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
