# [LM-HT SNN: Enhancing the Performance of SNN to ANN Counterpart through   Learnable Multi-hierarchical Threshold Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible and energy-efficient than artificial neural networks (ANNs), but they still lag behind ANNs in terms of learning performance. Previous efforts to optimize SNN gradients and architectures have helped close the gap, but there is still room for improvement. 

Solution:
This paper proposes a learnable multi-hierarchical threshold (LM-HT) neuron model for SNNs. The key ideas are:

1) The LM-HT model has multiple equidistant firing thresholds. Firing a spike at one threshold is equivalent to integrating inputs over multiple timesteps at a lower threshold. This allows the model to represent more information per timestep.

2) The input current and membrane potential leakage are made learnable over time via temporal-global information matrices (T-GIMs) and learnable leak parameters. This allows flexible control over the spike firing patterns, balancing accuracy and temporal information.  

3) With specific weight initializations, the LM-HT model with T-GIMs can represent both vanilla SNN gradients and quantized ANN activations. This establishes connections to both training frameworks.

4) A new SNN hybrid training method is proposed, leveraging quantized ANNs and fine-tuning with the LM-HT model. This alleviates performance degradation from ANN-SNN conversion.


Main Contributions:

- Establishes mathematical relationships between multi-threshold SNNs, vanilla SNNs, and quantized ANNs

- Proposes the LM-HT model with T-GIMs and learnable leaks for flexible and accurate learning

- Links the LM-HT model to both vanilla SNN and quantized ANN training frameworks 

- Introduces a hybrid training pipeline to boost converted SNN performance

- Achieves new state-of-the-art SNN accuracy on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, closing the gap with ANNs

The ideas connect insights across SNN optimization techniques and offer both accuracy and flexibility. The high performance demonstrates the potential of multi-threshold SNN models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel learnable multi-hierarchical threshold (LM-HT) spiking neuron model that can enhance SNN performance to match quantized ANNs while retaining biological plausibility, and develops an SNN training framework that unifies vanilla SNN training and ANN-SNN conversion approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors point out the mathematical equivalence relationship among the multi-threshold model, vanilla spiking model and quantized ANNs. This helps them propose an advanced multi-hierarchical threshold (LM-HT) model that can enhance SNN performance to the level of ANNs while maintaining spiking neuron characteristics. 

2. The proposed LM-HT model can establish a bridge between vanilla STBP training and quantized ANN training frameworks by adopting different parameter initialization schemes. This allows the LM-HT model to cover the representation capabilities of both frameworks.

3. The authors design a new hybrid training framework based on the LM-HT model. This can effectively alleviate the performance degradation problem of traditional ANN-SNN conversion methods under low latency by conducting additional STBP fine-tuning.

4. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on various datasets. For example, 81.76% top-1 accuracy is achieved on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-19 in just 2 time steps. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the LM-HT model and associated training frameworks to significantly improve SNN performance to be on par with quantized ANNs, while retaining key spiking neuron characteristics.
