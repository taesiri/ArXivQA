# [Drilling Down into the Discourse Structure with LLMs for Long Document   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13565)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called D3 (Drilling Down into the Discourse) for efficient evidence retrieval in long document question answering (LDQA). The key idea is to leverage the inherent discourse structure of documents, consisting of sections, sub-sections etc., to create a condensed representation. Specifically, each section is replaced with its heading and a short summary. This allows feeding the entire context to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for efficient section-level filtering. Thereafter, relevant sections undergo fine-grained evidence retrieval using the LLM. Experiments on QASPER and HotpotQA datasets show that D3 matches the state-of-the-art evidence F1 while using only 26% of the tokens. Further analyses demonstrate consistent superiority of D3 across document lengths in terms of evidence F1, tokens processed and latency. The simplicity and strong empirical performance make D3 an attractive choice for low-cost LLM-based evidence retrieval in LDQA. Future work involves mitigating information loss during summarization and enhancing multi-hop reasoning.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method called D3 (Drilling Down into the Discourse) for efficient evidence retrieval in long document question answering. It leverages the inherent discourse structure of documents by representing each section with a summary. This condensed representation allows large language models (LLMs) to analyze relationships between sections and identify relevant ones. The content of relevant sections is then further processed to retrieve evidence paragraphs. Experiments on the QASPER and HOTPOTQA datasets show that D3 can match the performance of state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches while using far fewer tokens, thus reducing computational and monetary costs. When combined with an elicitive prompting framework using self-ask, D3 achieves the best zero-shot performance on complex questions approaching that of using gold evidence. Analyses demonstrate D3's robustness across document lengths and the importance of global context modeling and section headings for good performance. Key advantages highlighted are competitive evidence retrieval, lower latency, and cost-effectiveness irrespective of document length. Limitations center on potential loss of information during summarization which impacts complex reasoning and focus so far on single documents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called D3 that leverages the inherent discourse structure of documents to create a condensed representation for efficient processing by large language models, enabling cost-effective evidence retrieval for long document question answering while achieving competitive performance.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:

How can we leverage the discourse structure commonly found in long documents to enable efficient and effective evidence retrieval for long document question answering using large language models?

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called D^3 (Drilling Down into the Discourse) that aims to:

1) Condense the document into a representation that captures the gist of each section using summaries. This allows the large language model to process the entire context to identify relevant sections.

2) Further drill down into the content of the identified relevant sections to retrieve fine-grained evidence paragraphs. 

The goal is to achieve strong evidence retrieval performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, while significantly reducing the number of tokens that need to be processed by the large language model. This makes the approach more efficient and cost-effective.

The central hypothesis is that by exploiting the inherent discourse structure of documents, the proposed D^3 approach can enable efficient and effective evidence retrieval for long document question answering using large language models. The paper presents experiments on two datasets to evaluate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new approach called $\mathbf{D}^3$ (\textbf{D}rilling \textbf{D}own into the \textbf{D}iscourse) for evidence retrieval in long document question answering. The key ideas of $\mathbf{D}^3$ are:

1) It utilizes the inherent discourse structure and organization of topics in long documents to create a condensed representation that captures the essence of each section. This allows efficient processing of the full document context by large language models.

2) It employs a two-step retrieve-then-read approach - first retrieving relevant sections and then drilling down to extract paragraphs from those sections. This emulates human cognitive search process.

3) Evaluations show it achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using far fewer tokens (26\% tokens of the best method) resulting in lower computational and monetary costs.

4) It demonstrates consistent performance across varying document lengths in terms of evidence F1 score, tokens processed and latency.

5) When combined with an elicitive prompting based "self-ask" agent, it achieves the best zero-shot performance on complex multi-hop question answering, coming within 4% of using gold evidence paragraphs.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel evidence retrieval technique $\mathbf{D}^3$ that leverages document discourse structure for efficiency while achieving competitive performance across different setups.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in the field of long document question answering:

1) Uniqueness of the approach: The paper proposes a novel approach called D^3 that utilizes the inherent discourse structure of documents to create a condensed representation for efficient processing. This allows large language models to analyze the full context while minimizing compute costs. Leveraging discourse structure in this way for evidence retrieval is a unique aspect not explored by prior works. 

2) Performance: The D^3 approach demonstrates competitive performance to state-of-the-art models on the QASPER benchmark while using only 26% of the tokens processed by the best baseline. It also shows promise on multi-hop reasoning when combined with self-ask prompting. This combination gets within 4% of gold-evidence performance, highlighting efficiency.

3) Generalization: As a zero-shot approach not reliant on task-specific fine-tuning, D^3 exhibits stronger generalization than supervised models. The paper analyzes robustness across varying document lengths and question types. The simplicity also makes it suitable for rapid testing in new domains.

4) Cost-effectiveness: By condensing sections and selectively processing relevant content, D^3 significantly reduces tokens processed and API calls made to large language models. This enables more cost-effective deployment than approaches that process the full documents.

In summary, the key distinguishing aspects are the novel use of discourse structure, strong zero-shot performance, generalization capability, and cost-efficiency compared to existing methods. The analysis provides insights into effectively applying LLMs for evidence retrieval.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the limitations section, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Explore methods to improve performance on complex questions requiring multi-hop reasoning while minimizing inference costs and information loss from section summarization. 

2. Evaluate capabilities of more advanced open-source language models as they become available, which may offer better performance and accessibility compared to enterprise models.

3. Investigate strategies and techniques to handle evidence retrieval from multiple documents or collections, as the current work focused only on single documents.  

4. Assess the quality of summarization in terms of faithfulness to original content and impact on end-to-end performance.

So in summary, the main future directions are: better handling of multi-hop reasoning questions, exploring open-source models, extending to multi-document scenarios, and evaluating summarization quality. The authors aim to build on the current work along these fronts.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes representing the document structure using sections and summaries. What is the intuition behind using this representation instead of just using paragraphs? How does this representation help in improving evidence retrieval performance?

2. The paper takes a two-step approach - first identifying relevant sections and then retrieving paragraphs from those sections. What is the motivation behind this two-step processing? Why not directly retrieve paragraphs from the entire document? 

3. The paper argues that representing sections by their summaries enables efficient processing while allowing the model to analyze relationships between different parts. However, summarization also leads to loss of information. How can this trade-off between efficiency and loss of information be balanced?

4. For section retrieval, the paper uses the section names and summaries as the representation. What other alternatives could be explored for representing sections more comprehensively while retaining efficiency?

5. The paper explores different strategies like MonoT5, Base, HierBase etc. for paragraph retrieval. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of these strategies? When would one strategy be preferred over another?  

6. The paper shows combining retrieval strategies leads to better performance. For example, Base + MonoT5. What is the intuition behind such combinations? How to determine the best sequence of strategies to combine?

7. The paper demonstrates the proposed method's robustness across varying document lengths. But very long documents may still exceed model limitations. How can the approach be adapted for extreme length documents?

8. The paper mainly evaluates on a single document setting. How will the performance differ in a multi-document scenario? What changes would be required to handle document collections?

9. The paper uses GPT models which can be expensive. How will the performance compare with more advanced open-source models? Will the improvements justify increased compute requirements?

10. The paper focuses on evidence retrieval, assuming access to a QA model. How will end-to-end performance change if the QA model is also optimized along with evidence retrieval?
