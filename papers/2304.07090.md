# [Delta Denoising Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07090)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, this paper does not seem to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, it appears to focus on introducing a new scoring technique called Delta Denoising Score (DDS) for optimizing images to match a text prompt. 

The key ideas behind DDS seem to be:

- Using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) for the purpose of image editing can lead to blurry, non-detailed outputs. This is because SDS has an inherent "noisy" component that interferes with the optimization process.

- By using a reference image-text pair where the text matches the content of the image, the "noisy" component of SDS can be estimated. 

- The difference or "delta" between the SDS scores of the reference pair and the target image-text pair provides a cleaner gradient direction that modifies only the portions of the image relevant to the text prompt.

So in summary, the main focus appears to be introducing DDS as a novel scoring technique to enable higher quality text-based image editing compared to directly using SDS. The key hypothesis seems to be that using a reference pair can help estimate and subtract out the undesired "noisy" components of the SDS gradients.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new diffusion-based scoring technique called Delta Denoising Score (DDS) for text-based image editing. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- DDS uses two query branches to the text-to-image diffusion model - one for the input image-text pair, and another for a reference image-text pair. The reference pair has a matched text prompt to the image content. 

- The score is calculated as the difference ("delta") between the outputs of the two query branches. 

- This allows isolating and removing the unwanted noisy gradients introduced by standard Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), leading to cleaner gradients that modify only the desired aspects of the image based on the text prompt.

- DDS enables effective prompt-to-prompt image editing by optimizing directly over the image pixels. It can also be used to train an image-to-image translation model in an unsupervised manner without needing aligned image pairs.

- Experiments show DDS achieves better results than SDS and other text-based editing methods in terms of edit quality and faithfulness to the input image.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing DDS as a new scoring technique to achieve higher quality and more controlled text-based image editing leveraging diffusion models. The delta formulation helps focus edits and prevent unwanted changes to other parts of the image.
