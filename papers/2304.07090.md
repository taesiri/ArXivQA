# [Delta Denoising Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07090)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, this paper does not seem to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, it appears to focus on introducing a new scoring technique called Delta Denoising Score (DDS) for optimizing images to match a text prompt. The key ideas behind DDS seem to be:- Using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) for the purpose of image editing can lead to blurry, non-detailed outputs. This is because SDS has an inherent "noisy" component that interferes with the optimization process.- By using a reference image-text pair where the text matches the content of the image, the "noisy" component of SDS can be estimated. - The difference or "delta" between the SDS scores of the reference pair and the target image-text pair provides a cleaner gradient direction that modifies only the portions of the image relevant to the text prompt.So in summary, the main focus appears to be introducing DDS as a novel scoring technique to enable higher quality text-based image editing compared to directly using SDS. The key hypothesis seems to be that using a reference pair can help estimate and subtract out the undesired "noisy" components of the SDS gradients.
