## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes a unified demonstration retriever (UDR) for in-context learning across diverse NLP tasks. Here are some key points in comparison to other related work:- Most prior work has focused on developing task-specific demonstration retrieval methods, like for semantic parsing or dialogue. In contrast, this paper aims to learn a single multi-task model for demonstration retrieval across a wide range of NLP tasks. This makes the approach more scalable and transferable.- The paper introduces a novel multi-task listwise ranking framework to train UDR, using language model feedback to assign rankings to candidate demonstrations. This allows incorporating signals from diverse tasks into a shared model. Prior approaches often used more heuristic or task-specific training objectives.- Through iterative mining, UDR is trained to find high-quality candidates across the full training sets. This differs from prior work like EPR that selected candidates in a more limited or heuristic fashion.- Experiments cover 30+ tasks across 13 families, demonstrating strong performance compared to baselines. The paper also analyzes UDR's robustness across varying LMs, unseen datasets, number of demonstrations, etc. This is a much wider evaluation than prior demonstration retrieval papers.Overall, the unified multi-task approach to demonstration retrieval is the key novelty. By learning from diverse tasks in a shared model, UDR advances the state-of-the-art in scalable and transferable demonstration retrieval for in-context learning. The breadth of tasks and robustness analyses are also strengths compared to prior focused efforts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring demonstration retrieval with better explainability, such as using nearest neighbor methods to find demonstrations with similar predicted next word distributions. The current dense retriever models like UDR are black-box models. Developing more interpretable models could be beneficial.- Studying the ordering/dependence between different demonstrations and how to model it, since currently the demonstrations are treated independently. The ordering of demonstrations can impact in-context learning performance.- Extending the research to incorporate unlabeled data and generated reasoning paths as demonstrations, not just labeled training examples. For instance, exploring self-supervised demonstration retrieval as in the recent MoT work. - Analyzing the transferability of demonstrations more thoroughly across different language models, since the paper shows UDR's demonstrations transfer well to varying sized LMs. This could provide insights into what makes demonstrations informative across models.- Scaling up the model size and leveraging other strong pre-trained models like RoBERTa as the retriever's initialization. The authors suggest this could further improve performance when paired with larger inference LMs.- Demonstration retrieval for broader tasks beyond the NLP tasks explored in the paper, to continue expanding the scope and generality of the approach.In summary, the main suggested directions are improving explainability, modeling demonstration dependence, incorporating unlabeled data, analyzing demonstration transferability, scaling up models, and expanding to more tasks. The authors lay out these promising avenues for advancing demonstration retrieval research in the future.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a unified demonstration retriever (UDR) for in-context learning, which is a single model to retrieve relevant examples as demonstrations for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Previous works focus on training task-specific retrievers for a few tasks separately, which is hard to transfer and scale.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a unified demonstration retriever (UDR) that can retrieve relevant examples from training data to serve as demonstrations for in-context learning across a wide range of NLP tasks. To train UDR, the authors cast different tasks' training signals into a unified listwise ranking formulation based on the language model's feedback. Specifically, for each training example, they select candidate examples from the training set and rank them according to the language model's likelihoods. They then train UDR with a listwise ranking loss to match the ranking from the language model's feedback. Additionally, they propose an iterative mining strategy where UDR is iteratively trained to select better candidates and then re-rank them. Through multi-task training across diverse datasets, UDR learns to effectively retrieve relevant demonstrations for in-context learning on unseen tasks. Experiments on 30+ tasks across 13 families demonstrate UDR's strong performance compared to previous task-specific methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of demonstration retrieval for in-context learning. In-context learning is a paradigm where a language model conditions on a few input-output examples (demonstrations) and a test input, and directly generates the prediction. It has been shown to be highly dependent on the provided demonstrations. Therefore, there is a need for methods to retrieve good demonstrations from the training data for a given test input, which is known as demonstration retrieval.The key limitations of existing demonstration retrieval methods that the paper aims to address are:- Previous works have focused on training task-specific retrievers for a few tasks separately. These are not easily transferable to new tasks and have high storage and deployment costs when scaling to many tasks. - Existing methods often use manually designed task-specific training signals/objectives for each task's retriever. This makes extending to new tasks difficult.To address these issues, the paper proposes a unified demonstration retriever model that can be trained on and applied to a wide variety of tasks in a scalable way, by casting the training into a common listwise ranking formulation based on language model feedback.In summary, the key problem is scaling up demonstration retrieval to work effectively across diverse tasks, which the proposed unified model aims to solve.
