# [Unified Demonstration Retriever for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04320)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is: How can we develop a unified demonstration retriever that can effectively retrieve relevant examples from training data to serve as demonstrations for in-context learning across a wide range of NLP tasks?The key points are:- In-context learning relies on providing a model with relevant demonstration examples, but previous work has focused on developing task-specific demonstration retrievers, which are hard to scale across many tasks. - This paper proposes a unified demonstration retriever (UDR) that can learn to retrieve examples for in-context learning across many different NLP tasks. - They introduce a unified listwise ranking formulation to incorporate training signals from diverse tasks based on language model feedback. - They propose a multi-task training framework and iterative mining strategy to find high-quality demonstration candidates across tasks.- Experiments show UDR significantly outperforms baseline retrievers on over 30 tasks and has strong ability to generalize to unseen datasets, varying language models, and different quantities of demonstrations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a unified demonstration retriever trained with multi-task learning and iterative mining can effectively retrieve demonstrations to improve in-context learning across a wide range of NLP tasks. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified demonstration retriever (UDR) that can retrieve relevant examples from training data to serve as demonstrations for in-context learning on a wide range of NLP tasks. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing a method to cast various tasks' training signals into a unified list-wise ranking formulation using language model's feedback. This allows training a single model on diverse tasks.- Introducing a multi-task list-wise ranking training framework with an iterative mining strategy to find high-quality candidate demonstrations across tasks.- Empirically demonstrating that UDR outperforms prior specialized demonstration retrievers on 30+ NLP tasks across 13 task families. The analyses also show UDR's versatility across varying scenarios.- Releasing the code and model to facilitate research on unified demonstration retrieval for in-context learning.In summary, the main contribution is developing a unified approach to train a single demonstration retriever that works well across diverse NLP tasks, overcoming the limitations of prior specialized retrievers. The proposed training framework and empirical analyses also provide insights into learning universal retrieval models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a unified demonstration retriever model called UDR that can retrieve relevant examples from training data to serve as demonstrations for in-context learning across a wide range of NLP tasks, outperforming prior task-specific retrieval methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper proposes a unified demonstration retriever (UDR) for in-context learning across diverse NLP tasks. Here are some key points in comparison to other related work:- Most prior work has focused on developing task-specific demonstration retrieval methods, like for semantic parsing or dialogue. In contrast, this paper aims to learn a single multi-task model for demonstration retrieval across a wide range of NLP tasks. This makes the approach more scalable and transferable.- The paper introduces a novel multi-task listwise ranking framework to train UDR, using language model feedback to assign rankings to candidate demonstrations. This allows incorporating signals from diverse tasks into a shared model. Prior approaches often used more heuristic or task-specific training objectives.- Through iterative mining, UDR is trained to find high-quality candidates across the full training sets. This differs from prior work like EPR that selected candidates in a more limited or heuristic fashion.- Experiments cover 30+ tasks across 13 families, demonstrating strong performance compared to baselines. The paper also analyzes UDR's robustness across varying LMs, unseen datasets, number of demonstrations, etc. This is a much wider evaluation than prior demonstration retrieval papers.Overall, the unified multi-task approach to demonstration retrieval is the key novelty. By learning from diverse tasks in a shared model, UDR advances the state-of-the-art in scalable and transferable demonstration retrieval for in-context learning. The breadth of tasks and robustness analyses are also strengths compared to prior focused efforts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring demonstration retrieval with better explainability, such as using nearest neighbor methods to find demonstrations with similar predicted next word distributions. The current dense retriever models like UDR are black-box models. Developing more interpretable models could be beneficial.- Studying the ordering/dependence between different demonstrations and how to model it, since currently the demonstrations are treated independently. The ordering of demonstrations can impact in-context learning performance.- Extending the research to incorporate unlabeled data and generated reasoning paths as demonstrations, not just labeled training examples. For instance, exploring self-supervised demonstration retrieval as in the recent MoT work. - Analyzing the transferability of demonstrations more thoroughly across different language models, since the paper shows UDR's demonstrations transfer well to varying sized LMs. This could provide insights into what makes demonstrations informative across models.- Scaling up the model size and leveraging other strong pre-trained models like RoBERTa as the retriever's initialization. The authors suggest this could further improve performance when paired with larger inference LMs.- Demonstration retrieval for broader tasks beyond the NLP tasks explored in the paper, to continue expanding the scope and generality of the approach.In summary, the main suggested directions are improving explainability, modeling demonstration dependence, incorporating unlabeled data, analyzing demonstration transferability, scaling up models, and expanding to more tasks. The authors lay out these promising avenues for advancing demonstration retrieval research in the future.
