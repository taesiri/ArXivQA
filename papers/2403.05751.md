# [MG-TSD: Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion Models with Guided   Learning Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models have shown promise for time series forecasting tasks. However, effectively utilizing their strong generative capacity for probabilistic forecasting remains challenging due to the instability arising from their stochastic nature. This variability results in low-fidelity samples being generated, leading to inferior prediction performance.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion (MG-TSD) model that leverages multiple intrinsic granularity levels in time series data to guide the learning process of diffusion models. The key idea is that the forward diffusion process that gradually corrupts the data distribution aligns with the process of smoothing the fine-grained data into coarser representations. Both result in a gradual loss of finer distribution features. 

The MG-TSD model contains three main components:
1) Multi-granularity Data Generator: Generates coarse-grained data at different granularity levels from the fine-grained observations.
2) Temporal Process Module: Employs RNNs to capture temporal dynamics at each granularity level. 
3) Guided Diffusion Process Module: Uses the coarse-grained data as targets to guide the diffusion model learning at intermediate steps. This regularizes the sampling path to preserve coarse-grained trends and patterns.  

A novel multi-granularity guidance loss function is derived. The training can be achieved by simply training diffusion models on multi-granularity data with shared parameters and variance schedules. A concise implementation is provided.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes MG-TSD model with an innovatively designed multi-granularity guidance loss function that efficiently guides diffusion learning.
2) Provides a simple yet effective implementation to leverage coarse-grained data at different granularity levels.
3) Extensive experiments show MG-TSD achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets compared to existing baselines.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to effectively utilize the generative capacity of diffusion models for probabilistic time series forecasting by leveraging multi-granularity guidance. The proposed model outperforms competitive baselines on various practical datasets.
