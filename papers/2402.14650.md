# [GaussianPro: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent work on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time high-quality neural rendering. However, 3DGS relies on sparse point clouds from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for initializing the 3D Gaussians. SfM often fails to reconstruct enough points in textureless regions, causing difficulties for 3DGS to optimize accurate Gaussians in these areas. This leads to rendered artifacts and quality drop.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes GaussianPro, a novel progressive propagation strategy to guide the densification of Gaussians in 3DGS. The key ideas are:

1) Render depth and normal maps from existing Gaussians and propagate geometric information between neighboring pixels using patch matching. This generates propagated depth and normal maps. 

2) Identify regions where rendered depth significantly differs from propagated depth. Back-project pixels in those regions as new 3D points to initialize Gaussians. This transfers geometry information from well-modeled areas to under-modeled areas.

3) Introduce a planar loss to regularize Gaussian orientations towards the propagated normals. This fits Gaussians better to planar surfaces in the scene.

Main Contributions:
- A progressive propagation strategy to produce more accurate and compact Gaussians in 3DGS, guided by rendered and propagated depth/normal maps.
- A planar loss that constrains Gaussians to geometries of real planar surfaces. 
- Significantly boosted performance over 3DGS on Waymo dataset (+1.15dB PSNR) and comparable results on MipNeRF360. More robust to fewer training views.

In summary, GaussianPro improves the geometry modeling of 3DGS via progressive propagation and plane constraints, achieving higher quality renderings especially for textureless regions in large-scale scenes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a progressive propagation strategy and planar constraint to improve the geometry and compactness of 3D Gaussian representations for higher quality neural rendering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel Gaussian propagation strategy that guides the densification to produce more compact and accurate Gaussians, particularly in low-texture regions.

2. Additionally leveraging a planar loss that provides a further constraint in the optimization of Gaussians to yield more accurate geometries. 

3. Achieving new state-of-the-art rendering performance on the Waymo and MipNeRF360 datasets. The method also presents robustness to the varying numbers of input images.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing a progressive propagation strategy to improve the geometry and compactness of the 3D Gaussians in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), thus boosting its performance especially in texture-less regions while maintaining efficiency. The planar loss also helps regularize the geometry. Quantitatively and qualitatively, this method achieves superior results over 3DGS on public datasets.

The paper proposes a novel progressive propagation strategy called "GaussianPro" to improve the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method for neural rendering. The key ideas include using patch matching to propagate depth and normals to textureless regions, constraining the gaussians to be planar, and leveraging multi-view stereo ideas to densify the scene. The method is evaluated on novel view synthesis and compared to prior work like NeRF and 3DGS. The key terms reflect this focus on improving neural rendering of novel views by enhancing the geometry and compactness of the 3D gaussian representation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a progressive propagation strategy to guide the densification of Gaussians. Can you explain in more detail how this strategy works and how it leverages information from well-modeled regions to improve under-modeled regions? 

2. The paper introduces a hybrid geometric representation that combines 3D Gaussians with 2D view-dependent depth and normal maps. What is the motivation behind this representation and how does it facilitate the progressive propagation process?

3. When performing propagation, the paper converts the depth and normal of each pixel into a 3D local plane representation. Can you explain what this plane representation is and why it is useful for propagation? 

4. The paper performs candidate plane selection and patch matching to determine the optimal plane for updating each pixel's depth and normal. Can you explain this process in more detail and discuss any limitations?  

5. For initializing new Gaussians, the paper projects pixels based on propagated depth where there is a significant difference from rendered depth. What is the intuition behind this criteria and can you suggest any alternatives?

6. The paper incorporates a planar loss to regularize the geometry of Gaussians. Why is this beneficial and what are the components of this planar loss? Are there any other losses that could provide further geometric constraints?

7. The optimization alternates between standard 3DGS training and performing the proposed propagation. What is the motivation behind this strategy? Are there any hyperparameters that control this?

8. How does the method balance improving geometric accuracy with retaining efficiency for real-time rendering? Are there any observable tradeoffs? 

9. The method shows particular improvements on large-scale scenes with textureless regions. Why does the method perform well in these cases compared to 3DGS? Are there any scenarios where 3DGS would be preferential?

10. The method currently does not handle dynamic scenes. Can you suggest any extensions to enable modeling of dynamic objects while retaining the benefits for static regions?
