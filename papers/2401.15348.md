# [AniDress: Animatable Loose-Dressed Avatar from Sparse Views Using   Garment Rigging Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AniDress: Animatable Loose-Dressed Avatars from Sparse Views Using Garment Rigging Models":

Problem:
Existing methods for building animatable human avatars from multi-view videos struggle with loose-fitting characters, as they rely predominantly on naked body models while leaving the garment part unmodeled. This fails for loose garments like dresses that have complex non-rigid dynamics differing from the body. Capturing such dynamics requires dense camera views as supervision. The goal is to build animatable avatars with loose clothing using only sparse multi-view videos.

Proposed Solution:
1) Employ a virtual bone-based garment rigging model obtained from physics-based simulation data. This model encodes complex garment dynamics into low-dimensional bone transformations (garment poses).

2) Develop a method to estimate temporally coherent garment poses from the sparse multi-view video using differentiable rendering and alignment with 2D cues like silhouettes, image normals and optical flows.

3) Build a pose-driven neural radiance field conditioned on body and garment poses to render photo-realistic images. Both poses deform the field to control body and cloth.

At test time, novel garment poses can be obtained to drive the rendering, either estimated from new videos or derived from simulation or learning methods.

Main Contributions:
- Adopt a simulation-based garment rigging model for capturing, animating and rendering cloth dynamics
- Method to estimate garment poses from sparse multi-view RGB videos 
- Pose-driven neural radiance field with explicit controllability over body and garment
- Multi-view dataset of loose-dressed performers capturing diverse motions

The method demonstrates superior performance in rendering natural cloth dynamics from sparse views over state-of-the-art methods, for both novel views and poses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents AniDress, a method to create animatable loose-dressed avatars from sparse multi-view videos by estimating garment poses with a simulation-based rigging model and using them alongside body poses to drive a pose-conditional neural radiance field.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Adopting a garment rigging model built from simulation data for capturing, animating, and rendering garment dynamics. 

2. Introducing a novel method to estimate garment poses from sparse multi-view RGB videos.

3. Developing a deformable neural radiance field conditioned on both garment and body poses, allowing for rendering high-quality body movements with natural garment dynamics. 

4. Creating a multi-view dataset that captures loose-dressed performers with diverse motions for evaluation and further research.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a full pipeline to create animatable loose-dressed avatars from only sparse multi-view videos, by using a garment rigging model to help capture, animate, and render the complex garment dynamics.

The paper introduces a method called "AniDress" to create animatable avatars of people wearing loose-fitting garments like dresses and skirts. It uses a garment rigging model built from physics-based simulation to capture the complex dynamics of loose garments. Key aspects include estimating garment poses from multi-view videos, using losses based on silhouettes, normals and optical flow to fit the model, and a neural radiance field that is conditioned on body and garment poses to render high-quality images. The method is evaluated on a new multi-view dataset and shown to perform better than prior work, especially for novel views and poses.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The garment rigging model relies on physics-based simulation data. How sensitive is the model to changes in simulation parameters like bending stiffness and time scale? Did the authors experiment with different parameter settings and how much variation can the model tolerate before performance degrades significantly?

2) Extracting the garment rigging model requires running skinning decomposition on the simulated meshes. How robust is this decomposition step to noise or inconsistencies in the input data? Were any pre-processing steps done on the simulated meshes before decomposition? 

3) The garment fitting step combines losses from silhouettes, normals and optical flow. What is the sensitivity of the fitting results to changes in the weights Î» for these losses? Was any analysis done to determine optimal values?

4) The number of virtual bones B used in the garment rigging model impacts fitting and rendering performance. What criteria did the authors use to select B=25 across all garments? Could a variable B tailored to each garment improve results?

5) For novel view synthesis, the method achieves higher LPIPS than PSNR scores compared to baselines. Does this indicate a trade-off between perceptual quality and pixel-level accuracy? And is further improvement possible on both fronts?

6) At test time, various options are presented for obtaining novel garment poses. But are the alternatives equally viable or is there a ranking in terms of realism of rendered animations? 

7) The garment rigging model is built independently for each garment type. How feasible would it be to develop a generalized model applicable across garment categories? What are the main challenges?

8) Volume rendering is used which can cause ghosting effects. Would incorporating geometric constraints during NeRF optimization help alleviate this issue in challenging novel poses?

9) How does performance scale with reduced number of input views and cameras? At what point does the method start to break down?

10) A key advantage claimed is the ability to handle loose garments from sparse views. Quantitatively, how "loose" were the garments used for evaluation and how much more challenging would extremely loose or layered clothing be?
