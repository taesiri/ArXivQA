# [Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting aims to predict future values of multiple interrelated time series. A key challenge is that in real-world applications, MTS data from different regimes (stages) are continuously collected, where each regime has distinct data distributions and variable dependencies. Directly retraining models on new regimes leads to catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge. Existing MTS forecasters fail to maintain performance and preserve learned dependency structures across regimes in this continual learning setting.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL) framework to enable continual MTS forecasting and dependency structure inference across regimes. The key ideas are:

1) Incorporate external structural knowledge (e.g. physical constraints, domain knowledge) to characterize variable dependencies in each regime. A graph learning module dynamically infers dependencies and is regularized to be consistent with the structural knowledge.

2) Develop a representation-matching memory replay scheme to efficiently preserve temporal and dependency coverage of seen regimes. MTS representations are partitioned into diverse modes and samples maximizing coverage of each mode are stored.

3) Continually learn from current regime and memory to maintain forecast accuracy and adapt across regimes while alleviating catastrophic forgetting.


Main Contributions:

1) A novel SKI-CL framework for continual MTS forecasting and dependency structure inference, which exploits structural knowledge to characterize regimes.

2) A graph-based forecaster with dynamic structure inference and consistency regularization using structural knowledge.

3) A representation-matching memory replay scheme maximizing temporal-dependency coverage of seen regimes.

4) Superior performance over state-of-the-arts for continual MTS forecasting on one synthetic and three real-world benchmarks. Learned dependency structures also closely align with structural knowledge.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in enabling graph-based continual multivariate time series analysis by effectively utilizing structural knowledge and memory replay strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL) framework for multivariate time series forecasting that leverages structural knowledge to steer the model towards identifying and adapting to different regimes over time while overcoming catastrophic forgetting through memory replay.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL) framework to perform MTS forecasting and infer dependency structures in the continual learning setting. 

2. Developing a graph-based forecaster that contains a structure learning module to capture temporal dependencies and dynamically infer dependency structures, and employing a consistency regularization scheme that exploits structural knowledge to facilitate continual forecasting.

3. Proposing a novel representation-matching memory replay scheme to maximize the temporal coverage of MTS data and preserve the underlying temporal dynamics as well as dependency structures within each regime. 

4. Conducting thorough experiments on one synthetic dataset and three real-world benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed SKI-CL on continual MTS forecasting tasks over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key innovation is leveraging structural knowledge to steer the forecasting model to identify and adapt to different regimes in continual MTS forecasting, and developing efficient mechanisms like dynamic graph learning and representation-based memory replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

To summarize, this paper proposes a new framework called Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL) for performing continual multivariate time series forecasting.
