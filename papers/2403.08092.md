# [Mitigating the Impact of Attribute Editing on Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08092)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Facial attribute editing using generative models like GANs and diffusion models can significantly degrade the performance of automated face recognition (AFR) systems. This presents a security risk as attribute editing can potentially be used to evade AFR systems and conceal one's identity. However, existing generative methods focus mostly on improving perceptual quality rather than preserving biometric utility. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose two techniques to mitigate the impact of facial attribute editing on AFR:

1) Local attribute editing: Uses a regularization-free method conditioned on depth maps and segmentation masks to edit finer details. Operates on a single facial image.

2) Global attribute editing: Uses a regularization-based method with custom losses (contrastive, cosine, smooth L1) and a regularization set of attribute images for editing coarser details. Requires a few exemplar images of the attribute and target individual.

The local editing framework uses ControlNet with a pre-trained diffusion model along with conditional inputs like depth map and segmentation masks. The global editing framework fine-tunes a DreamBooth diffusion model using attribute-based regularization and contrastive learning.

Main Contributions:

- Comprehensive analysis of 26 semantic, demographic and expression attributes altered via GAN/diffusion models on CelebA, CelebAMaskHQ and LFW datasets using ArcFace and AdaFace matchers

- Novel regularization-based global editing and regularization-free local editing techniques to mitigate impact of attribute editing on AFR

- Local editing with ControlNet and inpainting achieves 6.8% avg. FNMR within original performance on CelebAMaskHQ 

- Global editing with DreamBooth regularization achieves 5.4%/1.3% avg. FNMR within original ArcFace/AdaFace performance on CelebA

- Proposed methods outperform GAN and diffusion baselines like AttGAN, InstantID and BLIPDiffusion across metrics

- Automated assessment of attribute editing using LLaVA visual question answering
