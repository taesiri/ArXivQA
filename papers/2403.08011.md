# [Gujarati-English Code-Switching Speech Recognition using ensemble   prediction of spoken language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on improving performance of end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on code-switched Gujarati-English speech data. A key challenge in code-switched ASR is recognizing the language of words, as words from two languages can sound very similar, especially with certain accents. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes conditioning the encoder and decoder transformer layers of an end-to-end ASR model on predicted language IDs (LIDs) of words/characters in the output text. This is done by introducing language specific parameters in the multi-head self-attention mechanism and training these parameters using an additional loss term that aligns output LIDs with language probabilities calculated per speech frame. Two methods are proposed for incorporating language specific parameters.

The first method interpolates queries, keys and values from language specific embeddings before the attention calculation. The second method first calculates separate attention outputs per language and then interpolates the attention outputs. The interpolation weights come from a gating network that takes the encoder outputs as input.

A Seamless Temporal Classification (STC) loss is also introduced as an alternative to CTC loss to align language probabilities with output LIDs.

Contributions:
- Early exploration of conditioning end-to-end ASR models on predicted output language IDs to improve language recognition
- Two methods to introduce language specific parameters and explainability into transformer self-attention 
- STC loss for aligning language probabilities with reference language IDs while allowing flexibility in alignment

The methods did not significantly reduce Word Error Rate, but showed promise in predicting language directly from speech. Ideas for future work like using STC loss directly for ASR optimization are also discussed.
