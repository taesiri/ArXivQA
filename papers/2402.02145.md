# [Analyzing Sentiment Polarity Reduction in News Presentation through   Contextual Perturbation and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- News media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, but news writers often inject biases and emotional language which can distort the objectivity of reporting. Reducing this latent sentiment bias is essential for balanced, objective news stories.

- Existing works on sentiment transfer require explicit sentiment labels or parallel corpora, and manipulate overall sentence sentiment rather than aspect-specific sentiment. But news sentences can contain multiple aspects with different sentiments.  

- This paper addresses the novel problem of rewriting sentences to reduce the intensity of sentiment towards a targeted news aspect, while preserving meaning.

Proposed Solution:
- Employs two approaches - adversarial attack-based perturbations and prompt engineering with ChatGPT.

- Adversarial attack method involves perturbing input sentence by masking words and replacing/inserting/deleting with alternatives from BERT. Applies beam search to navigate candidate perturbations.

- ChatGPT method uses prompt engineering to leverage capabilities of large language model for rewriting.

- Both approaches aim to maximize desired (neutral/positive/negative) sentiment score for targeted aspect through transformations, while adhering to constraints on fluency, semantics preservation.

Main Contributions:
- Addresses new problem of aspect-specific sentiment intensity manipulation for news sentences via rewriting.

- Employs two robust approaches - adversarial attack and ChatGPT prompt engineering - to modify polarity.

- Created valuable parallel corpus of 1353 sentences with reduced sentiment counterparts.

- Analysis shows competitive performance of the two proposed methods in achieving desired polarity change while maintaining textual similarity, fluency and semantics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces two approaches - adversarial attack-based perturbations and prompt engineering with ChatGPT - to rewrite news sentences to reduce aspect-specific sentiment polarity while preserving semantics, in order to make news reporting more objective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. The paper addresses the novel problem of sentence rewriting, focusing on modifying the sentiment intensity of a targeted news aspect within the sentence while preserving its implicit meaning. 

2. The paper employs two distinct approaches for sentence modification: an adversarial attack-based perturbation method and a prompt engineering method with ChatGPT. These two methodologies offer a robust and flexible means to neutralize sentiment in news text.

3. The paper's extensive sentence rewriting efforts have resulted in the creation of a valuable parallel corpus, encompassing original sentences and their corresponding neutral sentiment counterparts. This dataset represents a significant contribution to the research community.

In summary, the key innovations of this work lie in tackling a new problem of aspect-based sentiment modification, leveraging two complementary techniques to achieve this goal, and compiling a dataset to enable further research. The techniques aim to reduce bias and polarity in news reporting to support more objective journalism.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two distinct approaches for sentence modification - adversarial attack-based perturbations and prompt engineering with ChatGPT. Can you explain the key differences between these two approaches and why both were explored? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

2. The adversarial attack-based perturbations involve three types of transformations - replace, insert and delete. Can you analyze the effect of each of these transformations on metrics like neutrality change, entailment and fluency? Which one is most effective and why?

3. The paper enforces certain transformation constraints like RepeatWordModification, StopwordModification etc. Can you explain the rationale behind each of these constraints? How do they support the overall goal of neutralizing sentiment while preserving semantics? 

4. A beam search algorithm is used to search through candidate transformations. How does the beam size affect metrics like neutrality change and entailment? What trade-offs need to balanced regarding beam size?

5. What is the effect of sentence length on entailment scores between input and transformed sentences? Why does entailment tend to decrease for longer sentences after transformation?

6. BERTScore and entailment thresholds are used as constraints. What happens when these constraints are tightened or relaxed? What is the appropriate balance point?

7. The paper demonstrates the method can also maximize positive or negative sentiment. How does performance differ compared to maximizing neutrality? Are there differences in ease of achieving positive vs negative polarity changes?   

8. Can you critically analyze the human evaluation results? Do you think the ratings adequately validate fluency, semantics preservation and neutrality for the transformed sentences?

9. The paper creates a parallel corpus of original and transformed sentences. In what ways can this corpus support future research directions? What other datasets would be valuable to generate?

10. Can you suggest some ways to improve or extend the proposed methodology, such as better evaluation metrics, techniques to improve efficiency or constraints to improve semantics preservation?
