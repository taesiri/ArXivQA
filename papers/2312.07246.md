# [Unifying Correspondence, Pose and NeRF for Pose-Free Novel View   Synthesis from Stereo Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07246)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework for pose-free novel view synthesis from unposed stereo image pairs. The key innovation is the unified integration of correspondence estimation, camera pose estimation, and neural radiance field (NeRF) rendering within a shared representation. This allows the complementary tasks to enhance each other - correspondence and pose estimation improve the geometry understanding for better rendering, while rendering provides supervision signals to refine correspondence and pose. The core of the method is a module that constructs a 4D correlation cost volume between multi-level image features, capturing pixel similarities. This volume undergoes refinement and serves as input to heads for optical flow, essential matrix-based pose regression, and a neural renderer that samples features along epipolar lines. The model is trained end-to-end with losses for image reconstruction, matching consistency, pose estimation, and triplet consistency between estimated flow, depth and pose. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose-free view synthesis. The unified framework outperforms previous generalized NeRF approaches by effectively handling challenging cases with extreme viewpoint changes and minimal overlap. Ablation studies validate the design choices and the synergistic relationships cultivated among the tasks.
