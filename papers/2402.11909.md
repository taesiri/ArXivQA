# [One2Avatar: Generative Implicit Head Avatar For Few-shot User Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Creating high-quality, personalized 3D head avatars typically requires capturing extensive videos of a subject performing various expressions. This is cumbersome and hinders scalability. The goal is to create photo-realistic avatars from sparse inputs (e.g. just a few images).

Solution:
1) Capture a multi-view, multi-expression dataset of 2407 subjects with 13 expressions captured from 13 viewpoints each. 

2) Propose a generative model to learn an avatar prior from this data. The model uses a 3DMM-anchored neural radiance field to represent identity and expression features attached to mesh vertices. It is trained via auto-decoding to reconstruct input images.

3) For few-shot adaptation to a new subject, jointly optimize the target identity latent code, expression parameters, camera poses and model weights to fit the given input images.

Main Contributions:
- Show that a reasonable avatar prior can be learned from a dataset with balanced identity, camera and expression diversity. Extensive variation is essential unlike single-view datasets.

- Demonstrate that the proposed 3DMM-anchored neural radiance field backbone is more effective than tri-planar methods for avatar creation via auto-decoding.

- Propose joint optimization of parametric face model fitting during few-shot adaptation to stabilize avatar creation.

- Achieve state-of-the-art few shot avatar creation results, especially for very sparse inputs (e.g. one image).


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a generative 3D implicit head avatar model using a 3DMM-anchored radiance field representation learned from a multi-view, multi-expression dataset that serves as a powerful prior for few-shot adaptation to new subjects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Demonstrating that an effective dynamic photo-realistic head avatar prior model can be learned from a captured dataset of a practical size (2407 subjects).

2. Showing that expression and camera view diversity is essential for such a prior, and should be balanced with identity diversity to form an affordable capture workload. 

3. Presenting a generative head avatar model built with a 3DMM-anchored neural radiance field backbone, which encodes both identity (appearance and geometry) and deformation priors.

4. Proposing a joint optimization framework for camera pose and face fitting along with the generative inverse fitting to stabilize the few-shot adaptation.

In summary, the key contribution is learning an effective avatar prior model from a multi-view multi-expression dataset, and using this prior along with joint optimization of geometric parameters to enable high quality few-shot avatar creation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Head avatar creation - The paper focuses on creating high-quality 3D head avatars that are photo-realistic and animatable. 

- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) - The method represents avatars using neural radiance fields that encode geometry and appearance.

- 3DMM-anchored NeRF - The avatar representation anchors neural radiance fields to the vertices of a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) mesh.

- Generative prior model - A generative model of 3D head avatars is pre-trained on a large multi-view, multi-expression dataset to serve as a strong prior. 

- Few-shot adaptation - The generative prior enables creating avatars from very sparse data (as few as one image) of a novel person through adaptation.

- Joint optimization - Camera parameters, 3DMM fits, and avatar model parameters are jointly optimized for few-shot adaptation to improve stability.

- Multi-view, multi-expression capture - A key dataset captured for 2400+ subjects from 13 views for 13 expressions, which is critical for learning the avatar prior.

In summary, the key ideas are around using a 3DMM-anchored NeRF representation to enable stable few-shot avatar creation through a generative prior trained on a multi-view, multi-expression dataset.
