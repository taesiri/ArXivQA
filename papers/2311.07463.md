# [MEGAVERSE: Benchmarking Large Language Models Across Languages,   Modalities, Models and Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07463)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents an expanded multilingual benchmarking study MEGAVERSE, evaluating 5 new LLMs across 22 datasets and 81 languages, finding GPT4 and PaLM2 outperform Llama models particularly for low-resource languages, with room for improvement on multimodal and RAI tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces an extension of the MEGA multilingual evaluation benchmark called MEGAVERSE, which adds 6 new datasets to cover 22 datasets and 81 languages. The goal is to benchmark the capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT4, PaLM2, Llama2, and LLaVa-v1.5 across a diverse set of multilingual and multimodal datasets. The authors find that GPT4 and PaLM2 generally outperform Llama2 models, especially on low-resource languages. GPT4 does better on certain datasets while PaLM2 excels on others. Llama2 struggles on Indian and African languages without fine-tuning. The multimodal LLaVa-v1.5 model is also benchmarked, showing decent performance on image captioning but poor performance on multimodal reasoning. Overall, GPT4 and PaLM2 demonstrate strong multilingual capabilities but issues like dataset contamination must be addressed. The work highlights the need to prioritize non-English LLM evaluation and development to avoid widening the digital divide. Key limitations are lack of contamination analysis, limited prompt tuning, and focus only on task accuracy without assessing other dimensions like fairness.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a concise summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces MEGAVERSE, an extension of the MEGA benchmarking suite for evaluating large language models across languages, modalities, models, and tasks. MEGAVERSE expands the suite to 22 datasets covering 81 languages, including low-resource African languages. It benchmarks several state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, PaLM2, Llama2, and LLaVa on these datasets. The results show that GPT-4 and PaLM2 generally outperform Llama models, especially on low-resource languages. GPT-4 does better on more datasets compared to PaLM2. Two new multimodal datasets are also added, on which the multimodal LLaVa model is evaluated. Overall, the study highlights GPT-4 and PaLM2 as top performers, while pointing to issues like dataset contamination that must be addressed for accurate LLM evaluation in non-English languages. It makes a case for prioritizing multilingual LLM evaluation to prevent excluding populations. The work also releases code to facilitate future multilingual LLM benchmarking research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper benchmarks several Large Language Models across 22 datasets covering 81 languages on a variety of NLP tasks, finding that GPT4 and PaLM2 generally outperform other models, especially on low-resource languages, but issues like dataset contamination must still be addressed to accurately evaluate LLMs on non-English languages.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How do the latest large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4, PaLM2, Llama2 and LLaVa perform on a diverse set of multilingual benchmarks across different languages, modalities and tasks?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- The latest LLMs like GPT4 and PaLM2 will outperform older models like Llama2 on multilingual tasks, especially for low-resource languages.

- There will be differences in the strengths of the LLMs, with some performing better on certain tasks or languages than others. 

- Multimodal LLMs like LLaVa will struggle on reasoning tasks compared to language-only tasks.

- Models will perform worse on languages with non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages compared to English.

So in summary, the central research focus is benchmarking and analyzing the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs on a wide variety of multilingual tasks and datasets to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses and differences. The goal is to expand the understanding of these models' abilities beyond English.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is extending the MEGA benchmarking suite for evaluating large language models across languages, modalities, models, and tasks. Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Adding 6 new datasets to the existing MEGA suite to create an expanded benchmark called MEGAVERSE, covering 22 datasets and 81 languages. 

- Benchmarking 5 new state-of-the-art large language models - PaLM2, Llama2 (3 variants), and LLaVa-v1.5 - in addition to existing models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo.

- Including two multimodal datasets in the benchmark and evaluating the multimodal LLaVa-v1.5 model on them.

- Conducting extensive experiments across models and datasets, analyzing performance trends, especially on low-resource languages. 

- Providing results and analysis to compare capabilities of latest LLMs in terms of their multilingual performance across diverse tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is expanding the scope and coverage of the MEGA benchmark for systematically evaluating and analyzing LLMs across languages, models, modalities and tasks through the introduction of MEGAVERSE.
