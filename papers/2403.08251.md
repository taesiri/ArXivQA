# [Emergence of Social Norms in Large Language Model-based Agent Societies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Social norms emerge in human societies to reduce conflicts and enable coordination. As AI systems are deployed in real-world situations, empowering them to understand and comply with social norms is crucial for acceptance by humans.  
- Generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show human-like behaviors but may not adequately understand social norms, especially culture-specific ones, potentially causing conflicts.
- Prior work on social norm emergence focused on isolated aspects and lacked an integrated architecture for implementation.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel normative architecture called CRSEC to facilitate the emergence of social norms within a society of generative agents.
- CRSEC has 4 key modules - Creation & Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance.
- Creation & Representation: Norm entrepreneurs create personal norms consistent with their descriptions. Norms are formally represented and stored.  
- Spreading: Agents influence others to adopt norms via communication. Agents also identify norms by reflecting on conversations and observations.
- Evaluation: Performs sanity check on identified norms before accepting them as personal norms. Also synthesizes personal norms periodically into more compact, general norms.
- Compliance: Raises agent's awareness of personal norms during planning and action taking.

Main Contributions:  
- First architecture to facilitate emergence of social norms in societies of large language model-based agents
- Addresses multiple key aspects of social norm emergence within one integrated architecture
- Experiments in Smallville environment demonstrate capability to establish social norms and reduce conflicts  
- Positive human evaluation involving questionnaires and interviews with 30 people

The architecture leverages generative and language capabilities of agents while benefiting from extant multi-disciplinary literature on social norm emergence. By facilitating agents to establish their own standards of behavior, conflicts can be reduced and coordination improved in multi-agent systems deployed in real-world situations involving humans.
