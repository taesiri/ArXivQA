# [Beyond Reference-Based Metrics: Analyzing Behaviors of Open LLMs on   Data-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10186)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Data-to-text (D2T) generation with large language models (LLMs) is underexplored. Existing benchmarks may be contaminated in LLM training data and have issues with automatic evaluation.  

- Lack of testing grounds to properly evaluate capabilities of LLMs for D2T generation.

Solution:
- Introduce Quintd, a tool to collect ad-hoc benchmark datasets from 5 domains (weather, technology, sports, health, world facts) in standard formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown).

- Collect Quintd-1 benchmark with 1000 unlabeled examples to test LLMs' zero-shot D2T abilities.

- Test 3 open 7B parameter LLMs (Llama2, Mistral, Zephyr) on the benchmark using reference-free evaluation.

- Evaluate using manual annotations (4 error types) from crowdworkers and GPT-4 based automatic metric.

Key Contributions:

- Show that open LLMs can generate fluent outputs from structured data in zero-shot setting.

- Identify semantic accuracy as a major issue, with ~80% of LLM outputs containing an error.

- Find long inputs cause practical problems (context length, memory, few-shot infeasibility). 

- Provide recommendations like adding units, prefixing outputs, limiting fields to improve quality.

- Establish protocols for rigorous, replicable evaluation of LLMs on semantic accuracy for D2T generation.

The paper focuses on analyzing model behaviors rather than comparing to other systems. The key novelty is in reference-free evaluation and testing on unlabeled real-world data in common formats.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the abilities of open large language models to generate coherent and semantically accurate texts from structured data across five domains, finding fluency but many semantic errors with recommendations to improve accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new data collection tool called \datatool for creating ad-hoc test sets for data-to-text generation across five domains (weather, technology, sports, health, and world facts).

2. It collects a new benchmark dataset called \benchmark using \datatool that contains 1000 unlabeled examples across the five domains. This allows testing data-to-text generation models without human references.

3. It conducts an extensive set of experiments evaluating three open 7B parameter language models (Llama2, Mistral, Zephyr) on the \benchmark dataset using zero-shot prompting. The experiments analyze model behaviors and output quality.

4. It evaluates the model outputs using a combination of a customized automatic metric based on GPT-4 and human annotations. The evaluation focuses on semantic accuracy at the token level.

5. Based on the evaluation, the paper provides recommendations regarding the use of open LLMs for data-to-text generation, highlighting issues with accuracy, input length limitations, evaluation, etc.

In summary, the main contribution is the rigorous experimental analysis of open LLMs on data-to-text generation using the newly introduced unlabeled benchmark and evaluation protocols. The paper provides insights into model behaviors and recommendations for future work.

The paper focuses on analyzing the capabilities of open LLMs on data-to-text generation across different domains and formats in a zero-shot setting. It uses an ad-hoc benchmark called \benchmark collected using a tool called \datatool to test semantic accuracy through token-level error annotations. Both human evaluation and a customized GPT-4 based metric are used for reference-free evaluation. The paper also provides recommendations on using LLMs for D2T generation based on observed model behaviors.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using an ad-hoc dataset rather than existing benchmarks for evaluating data-to-text generation with LLMs. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of this approach? How does it impact generalizability of the results?

2. The paper uses a reference-free evaluation scheme based on manual error annotations. What are the trade-offs compared to traditional reference-based automatic metrics? How does the choice of the error taxonomy impact the results? 

3. The paper introduces both an automatic metric using GPT-4 and human evaluation for identifying errors. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach? To what extent do you think the two evaluation methods provide complementary signal?

4. During the preliminary experiments, the authors make several observations about issues with long context, irrelevant fields in inputs, etc. To what extent do you think these observations generalize to other formats/domains beyond the five included in the paper?

5. The paper examines both open and closed LLMs. What differences would you expect in the behaviors and capabilities of models that have greater parameter counts and access to more training data? How could the experimental design be extended to probe these aspects?

6. What are other potential prompt engineering techniques, beyond the ones explored in this paper, that could reduce errors and improve faithfulness for LLM-based data-to-text generation? What are some of the trade-offs involved?

7. The error analysis is performed at the token level. What additional insights could be obtained by examining errors with respect to higher-order semantic units or discourse structure? What methodological innovations would enable such analyses?

8. How suitable do you think the GPT-4 based evaluation metric is for real-world deployment, given practical constraints around cost, reproducibility, etc.? How can these issues be addressed?

9. The paper focuses only on English language generation. What challenges do you anticipate in applying a similar methodology to other languages, especially morphologically rich or low-resource languages?

10. What directions for future work on reference-free evaluation of data-to-text generation do you think are most promising, given the findings from this study? What are 2-3 open problems you would like to see addressed?
