# [CN-RMA: Combined Network with Ray Marching Aggregation for 3D Indoors   Object Detection from Multi-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
3D object detection from multi-view images is challenging due to the lack of explicit geometry to provide occlusion information. Existing methods either completely ignore occlusion issues which leads to inaccurate detection, or use a two-stage approach which lacks end-to-end trainability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an end-to-end 3D object detection network called CN-RMA that incorporates:

1) A multi-view stereo (MVS) module to reconstruct a rough truncated signed distance function (TSDF) of the scene.

2) A novel "ray marching aggregation" (RMA) module that uses the predicted TSDF to address occlusion issues during feature aggregation from images to 3D. It computes weights for sampled points along each camera ray based on opacity values derived from the TSDF. This allows awareness of occlusion during feature aggregation.

3) A 3D detection module based on sparse convolutional networks.

The model is trained end-to-end using a 3-stage pretraining and finetuning approach:

1) Pretrain MVS module for reconstruction 

2) Freeze MVS, pretrain detection module using RMA for aggregation

3) Jointly finetune full model end-to-end

Main Contributions:

1) An end-to-end network for 3D detection from multi-view images combining MVS reconstruction and 3D detection.

2) A novel RMA module for occlusion-aware feature aggregation from images to 3D based on ray marching and predicted TSDF scene geometry.

3) State-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets, outperforming previous methods and two-stage baselines. Demonstrates the benefit of end-to-end learning with occlusion modeling.

In summary, the key innovation is in occlusion handling during end-to-end feature aggregation by deriving opacity values through ray marching on the predicted scene geometry. This leads to improved 3D object detection accuracy.
