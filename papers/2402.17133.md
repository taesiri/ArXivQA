# [SAM-DiffSR: Structure-Modulated Diffusion Model for Image   Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17133)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from this paper:

Problem:
- Existing diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) models perform noise sampling from a single distribution, limiting their ability to handle complex real-world images. This results in inferior structure restoration and chaotic textures/artifacts across regions.

- Segment Anything Model (SAM) can generate fine-grained segmentation masks distinguishing different semantic regions, but directly integrating it into SR models increases computation cost.

Solution - SAM-DiffSR :
- Proposes a Structure-Modulated Diffusion framework for SR that utilizes SAM's ability to distinguish regions while not adding inference cost. 

- Encode SAM-generated masks with regional position information using Structural Position Encoding module. 

- At training time, use encoded mask to modulate the noise distribution in the diffusion model, enabling it to adapt noise per region. Train model to approximate this modulated noise.

- At test time, only use trained diffusion model for SR, without needing SAM, thus no added computation.

Key Contributions:
- Novel incorporation of SAM's segmentation ability to enhance diffusion model for SR, without increasing inference cost.

- Modulate noise in diffusion process using SAM-encoded masks to distinguish between different regions and adapt noise sampling per region.

- Achieves superior SR performance (0.74dB PSNR gain) and fewer artifacts over state-of-the-art. Ablations validate the approach.

In summary, it proposes a way to utilize SAM's segmentation capability to empower diffusion models to distinguish between semantic image regions for improved SR, while eliminating the SAM computation overhead during inference.
