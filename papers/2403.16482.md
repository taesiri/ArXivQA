# [Determined Multi-Label Learning via Similarity-Based Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-label classification tasks where each image has multiple labels are very useful but time-consuming and expensive to collect full annotations for. Methods to reduce annotation cost are needed.

- Existing works have settings like single positive label per image or complementary labels, but these still require multiple annotations per image.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new setting called "Determined Multi-Label Learning" (DMLL) where only a single "Yes/No" question is asked per image for a random label. 

- A theoretically grounded risk estimator loss function is derived for this DMLL setting. It aligns model predictions with limited annotation.

- A similarity-based prompt learning method is introduced that uses semantic similarity between class names to enrich label information. It minimizes the risk estimator loss.

Main Contributions:

1. A new DMLL annotation setting that significantly reduces annotation cost for multi-label tasks.

2. A risk-consistent loss tailored for the DMLL setting with theoretical guarantees.

3. A novel similarity-based prompt learning approach that enhances semantic label information by minimizing the proposed loss.

4. Experiments showing state-of-the-art performance over existing multi-label, single positive, and complementary label methods on 4 datasets. Demonstrates efficacy of proposed DMLL idea and methods.

In summary, the paper proposes a highly practical DMLL setting to reduce annotation cost along with an effective model learning approach using risk estimation and semantic prompt learning for multi-label classification.
