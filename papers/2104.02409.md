# [Learning to Estimate Hidden Motions with Global Motion Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02409)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Optical flow estimation aims to predict the apparent motion between two image frames as the camera and/or objects move. Occlusions, where a point visible in one frame disappears in the next, pose a major challenge since they violate assumptions like brightness constancy. 
- Existing optical flow methods struggle to accurately estimate the motion of occluded regions, especially when the occlusions are more significant and local evidence is insufficient.

Proposed Solution
- The key idea is to use global aggregation of motion information to help resolve local ambiguities caused by occlusions. This is based on the observation that points belonging to the same object often have similar motion.
- A Global Motion Aggregation (GMA) module is introduced, which uses a self-attention mechanism to enable long-range propagation of motion information between pixels with similar appearance (capturing object semantics).
- The GMA features are combined with local motion features and decoded to residual flow, giving flexibility to use global or local evidence.

Contributions
- Introduction of a GMA module using self-attention to enable non-local aggregation of motion information based on image self-similarities.
- Significantly improved optical flow accuracy in occluded regions on Sintel dataset, reducing error by 13.6-13.7% while maintaining accuracy in non-occluded regions.  
- State-of-the-art optical flow performance, obtaining the best results on the challenging Sintel Clean and Final benchmark leaderboards amongst all published and unpublished approaches.
- Demonstrates global reasoning is highly effective at resolving occlusion-based local ambiguities in optical flow.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a global motion aggregation module to help optical flow networks resolve ambiguities caused by occlusions by modeling long-range dependencies between pixels based on appearance self-similarities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing a global motion aggregation (GMA) module to help optical flow algorithms better estimate the motion of occluded pixels. The key ideas are:

1) Occlusions pose a major challenge for optical flow algorithms relying on local evidence. Estimating the motion of occluded pixels is difficult, especially in the two-frame case.

2) The paper proposes to globally aggregate motion information across the image to help resolve these local ambiguities. The aggregation is based on modeling self-similarities in the reference image under the assumption that points on the same object often have similar motion. 

3) A transformer-inspired module is introduced to aggregate motion features globally based on an attention mechanism over the image self-similarities. This provides extra information to estimate occluded motions.

4) Extensive experiments show the proposed approach significantly improves optical flow accuracy in occluded regions without damaging performance elsewhere. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on Sintel, outperforming top methods like RAFT by over 13% in terms of average end-point error.

In summary, the main contribution is a global motion aggregation module that propagates information over long ranges to resolve local ambiguities caused by occlusions in optical flow estimation. Both the motivation and strong experimental results demonstrate this is an effective approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that modeling long-range dependencies is critical for resolving ambiguities caused by occlusions in optical flow estimation. How exactly does the proposed global motion aggregation module achieve this through the use of self-attention? What are the key differences from standard self-attention as used in transformers?

2. The global motion aggregation module uses separate query/key features derived from the visual context and value features derived from the motion encoding. What is the motivation behind using different sources for these? Have the authors experimented with other possible combinations?

3. The ablation studies show that simply concatenating the local and globally aggregated motion features works better than replacing the local features. Why might this be the case? What implicit notions might the network be learning through this design?  

4. The paper hypothesizes that the network learns to attend to points on the same object that share similar motion vectors. Is there any evidence to support this claim beyond the qualitative attention visualizations? Could the network be exploiting other statistical biases in the data?

5. How does the design of the global aggregation module deal with cases where the optical flow field is not approximately homogeneous even within a single object? For example, when an object rotates relative to the camera. Does this pose a limitation?

6. The improvement from global aggregation is much more significant on the synthetic Sintel dataset compared to real-world KITTI data. Why might this be and how could the approach be adapted to work better for real-world sequences?

7. The global aggregation module adds a relatively small computational overhead, but still increases run time by 20%. What scope is there to optimize the implementation to reduce this further? Could model distillation help?

8. How does the performance compare when using different numbers of GRU decoder iterations? Is there a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency?

9. The method currently operates on two input frames. How could the idea of global aggregation be extended to a multi-frame architecture? What challenges might arise?

10. The improvement is shown mostly for occluded regions, but some gain is also reported for non-occluded regions. What explanations do the authors provide for this and how could this effect be further analyzed?
