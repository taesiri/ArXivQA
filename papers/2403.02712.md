# [Breeze-7B Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for open-source large language models (LLMs) specialized for Traditional Chinese language tasks. Existing models optimized for English often degrade in performance on non-English text. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce Breeze-7B, an LLM based on Mistral-7B, enhanced for Traditional Chinese comprehension and conversation abilities.

Key Contributions:
- Extended the tokenizer with additional Chinese-specific tokens to improve compression rate and speed. 
- Further pretrained Breeze-7B on 650GB of high-quality Traditional Chinese data.
- Finetuned the model on instructional data to improve question answering abilities while retaining capabilities of base model.
- Evaluated on comprehension benchmarks (TMMLU+, DRCD, etc.) where Breeze-7B performs very well compared to other open-sourced 7B models.
- Evaluated on chat benchmarks (MT-Bench variants) where Breeze-7B is competitive, with room for improvement on STEM and writing tasks.
- Released weights for Breeze-7B base and instruct variants to enable community building.

In summary, the authors introduced Breeze-7B, an open-source 7B parameter LLM specialized for Traditional Chinese. Through additional pretraining and finetuning, it demonstrates strong language understanding and conversation abilities on several benchmarks. The model represents progress towards capable yet transparent Chinese chatbots and question answering systems.
