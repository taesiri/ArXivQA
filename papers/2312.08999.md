## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel conformal data synthesis algorithm to reliably improve Deep Learning model performance on small, imbalanced datasets with non-separable classes. The core innovation is using the Conformal Prediction framework to introduce statistical guarantees on the quality of synthesized data points. By limiting synthesis to high-confidence regions of the feature space, identified through hypothesis testing, the distributional fit between real and synthetic samples is provably accurate. Theoretical proofs formally underpin these statistical claims. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with varying difficulty, the algorithm is shown to significantly enhance model generalization. On a digits dataset with only 300 samples, F1 score jumps from 17% to 79% when extending the training set with conformal synthetics. Class imbalance is corrected by exponentially increasing the minority classâ€™ representation. Even non-separable wine classes see a 25% F1 boost with additional synthetic training points. The proposed technique reliably improves model learning across challenges like small sample counts, imbalance, overlap and privacy. Its versatility and theoretical foundations position it as an advantageous data augmentation solution for Deep Learning.
