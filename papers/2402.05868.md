# [EmojiCrypt: Prompt Encryption for Secure Communication with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects covered in the paper:

Problem:
- Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raise privacy concerns due to potential data breaches and unauthorized access when user data is transmitted/stored on cloud platforms. 
- Even if data transmission/storage is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself can still access users' actual data content. This prevents confidential data sharing with LLM services.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes \model, a simple yet effective mechanism to encrypt user inputs before sending to LLM cloud platforms. This renders prompts indecipherable to humans or LLMs while retaining original intent.

- \model uses emojis to encrypt sensitive user information in prompts. Two encryption methods are introduced: 
   1) Reusable Encryption: For private user data accessed frequently (e.g. purchase history for recommendations)
   2) Non-Reusable Encryption: For sensitive user data beyond a predefined set (e.g. product reviews)

- Dual LLMs are utilized - LLM\textsubscript{enc} for prompt encryption and LLM\textsubscript{inf} for task inference using encrypted inputs.

Key Contributions:
- Experiments on 3 real-world datasets show \model encrypts personal information in prompts while maintaining or even improving LLM precision.
- Results highlight \model's practicality in safeguarding user privacy without compromising utility or performance of cloud-based LLMs.
- The concept of prompt encryption using emojis to balance privacy and performance is a novel, foundational idea for future research directions.

In summary, the paper makes important headway in addressing the pivotal issue of user privacy for practical LLM applications by proposing and validating a straightforward emoji-based prompt encryption technique.
