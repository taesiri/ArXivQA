# [Enhancing Role-playing Systems through Aggressive Queries: Evaluation   and Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10618)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language model (LLM) based role-playing systems struggle to align with roles when handling complex, trapped queries in boundary scenarios. For example, when asked tricky questions that contain hidden inconsistencies with the role's characteristics, LLMs fail to identify the traps and deviate from proper role alignment.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes the Modular Orchestrated Trap-setting Interaction System (MORTISE) to generate adversarial data for evaluating and improving LLMs' role alignment capabilities. 
- MORTISE contains multiple LLM modules (e.g. dialogue planner, topic manager, etc.) that collaboratively create multi-turn dialogues with embedded traps and inconsistencies related to the role.
- Using MORTISE, the authors construct an aggressive evaluation dataset across 190 roles to benchmark existing role-playing LLMs. Experiments show deficiencies in alignment for all models.
- Further, the paper collects adversarial training data called RoleAD from MORTISE for 180 roles. Fine-tuning on RoleAD significantly enhances models' alignment in boundary scenarios, while also improving performance in ordinary dialogues.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes MORTISE, a novel multi-module system to generate highly challenging and role-relevant adversarial queries to evaluate role-playing dialogue systems.
- Creates an aggressive evaluation benchmark using MORTISE across 190 roles in Chinese and English, and conducts extensive experiments that demonstrate deficiencies of existing role-playing LLMs.  
- Constructs a high-quality adversarial dataset called RoleAD using MORTISE and shows that even a small amount of RoleAD data can markedly improve role alignment capabilities in boundary scenarios as well as conversational abilities in ordinary scenarios.
