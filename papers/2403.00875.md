# [Enhancing Protein Predictive Models via Proteins Data Augmentation: A   Benchmark and New Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data augmentation has been widely studied for images and texts, but relatively unexplored for proteins. However, high-quality labeled protein data is scarce and expensive to obtain. Therefore, effective data augmentation techniques are needed to improve model performance and generalization on various protein-related prediction tasks.  

- Existing image/text augmentation methods may not work well when directly applied to proteins due to ignoring biological semantics of proteins. Also, it is hard to find the optimal augmentation strategy across different tasks and architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper collects and extends image/text augmentations for proteins, categorizing them into token-level, sequence-level and semantic-level methods. 

- Two novel semantic-level protein augmentation methods are proposed: (1) Integrated Gradients Substitution identifies salient regions using integrated gradients and perturbs unimportant residues. (2) Back Translation Substitution augments via mRNA translation while preserving semantics.  

- An Automated Protein Augmentation (APA) framework is developed to automatically search for optimal augmentation combinations tailored for different tasks and architectures.

Key Contributions:  
- Provides first comprehensive evaluation of various protein augmentation techniques across multiple prediction tasks.

- Proposes two semantically meaningful protein augmentation methods leveraging saliency detection and biological knowledge.  

- Develops APA framework that adaptively selects best augmentation strategies for different models and tasks, improving performance by 10.55% on average.

In summary, the paper explores protein augmentation through adapting and proposing new techniques, as well as an automated framework to select optimal augmentation combinations. This enables more effective utilization of scarce labeled protein data across diverse prediction tasks.
