# [Multimodal Informative ViT: Information Aggregation and Distribution for   Hyperspectral and LiDAR Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal land cover classification using hyperspectral images (HSI) and LiDAR data is challenging due to redundancy between modalities, loss of complementary information, and lack of performance awareness in representations.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes Multimodal Informative Vision Transformer (MIViT) with an information aggregate-distributing mechanism to reduce redundancy, preserve complementary information and enhance performance perception.

- MIViT first extracts both local features using CNNs and global features using Transformers from multimodal data.

- An Oriented Attention Fusion (OAF) module fuses multi-level features across modalities.

- An Information Aggregation Constraint (IAC) based on mutual information reduces redundancy by minimizing mutual information between modalities while maximizing mutual information between fused and individual modality features.  

- An Information Distribution Flow (IDF) enhances performance awareness by distributing global classification information from the fused representation to the individual modality feature maps using self-distillation.

- Lightweight CNN classifiers handle missing modalities leveraging knowledge transfer from the Transformer.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes MIViT architecture with information aggregate-distributing mechanism for effective multimodal fusion.

- Introduces IAC constraint to reduce redundancy and preserve complementary information based on mutual information.

- Develops IDF to distribute global classification knowledge to enhance perception of individual modalities.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 5 datasets, highlighting MIViT's effectiveness. 

- Enables handling of missing modalities via IDF knowledge transfer to lightweight CNN classifiers.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in multimodal fusion for land cover classification by effectively aggregating complementary information while reducing redundancy using mutual information theory and Transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new deep learning framework called Multimodal Informative ViT (MIViT) for multimodal land cover classification. MIViT has an innovative information aggregate-distributing mechanism to reduce redundancy between modalities and enhance performance awareness in the fused representations.

2. It introduces an Information Aggregation Constraint (IAC) based on mutual information to remove redundant information while preserving complementary information between modalities. 

3. It designs an Information Distribution Flow (IDF) to distribute the global classification information from the fused representation to the individual modality feature maps. This enhances the performance perception ability of the shallow classifiers.

4. It demonstrates MIViT's ability to handle missing modalities during inference by using lightweight independent modality classifiers trained with knowledge distillation.

5. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets show state-of-the-art performance of MIViT compared to existing methods, achieving 95.56% average overall accuracy. This validates the effectiveness of MIViT's bidirectional aggregate-distributing mechanism for multimodal land cover classification.

In summary, the key innovation is the information aggregate-distributing mechanism in MIViT that reduces redundancy and enhances awareness of complementary information between modalities to improve classification performance. The ability to handle missing modalities is also a notable contribution.
