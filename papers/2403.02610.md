# [ChatGPT4PCG 2 Competition: Prompt Engineering for Science Birds Level   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02610)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper presents the second edition of the ChatGPT4PCG competition that focuses on using prompt engineering with ChatGPT to automatically generate levels for the game Science Birds. The first competition in 2023 was successful but had some limitations:
1) Metrics could be easily gamed by generating repetitive structures
2) Restriction to single-turn conversations limited advanced prompt engineering techniques
3) Suboptimal image classifier and function signatures hindered ChatGPT's performance

Proposed Solution:
To address these limitations, the authors introduce several changes and improvements for the 2024 competition:

1) Add a "diversity" metric to measure diversity of generated levels for the same target character across trials. This discourages repetitive structures.

2) Allow submission as a Python program instead of just a prompt text file. This enables techniques requiring multi-turn conversations, control flow, and external tools.

3) Improve image classifier to better resemble styles of Science Birds structures, using a new dataset of computer fonts.

4) Select a better function signature through an experiment assessing different options.

Contributions:

1) Introduce the second ChatGPT4PCG competition with various improvements to mitigate limitations of the first competition.

2) Provide a platform for developing and evaluating prompt engineering techniques for Science Birds level generation. Showcase example implementations.

3) Validate effectiveness of new metrics, classifier, and function signature through experiments.

4) Share implementation examples of various prompt engineering techniques and evaluate their performance to serve as a starting point and educational resource.

5) Aim to advance research in prompt engineering and procedural content generation by fostering innovation through the competition format.

In summary, the paper presents the next iteration of the ChatGPT4PCG competition for Science Birds level generation using prompt engineering, with various enhancements to evaluation, submission format, and resources provided. The competition serves as a platform to educate and push the boundaries of these exciting fields.
