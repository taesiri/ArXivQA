# [LLM-SQL-Solver: Can LLMs Determine SQL Equivalence?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10321)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Determining SQL query equivalence is an important but challenging task with applications in query optimization and evaluating text-to-SQL systems. However, it is theoretically undecidable in the general case.

- Existing solutions like Cosette have limited capabilities and don't support many common SQL features. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in logical reasoning tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors investigate whether LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can determine the equivalence between two SQL queries under two notions: semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence. 

- They propose two prompting techniques to assist the LLM: "Miniature & Mull" for semantic equivalence, which executes the queries on a simple database and asks if a counterexample can be constructed; and "Explain & Compare" for relaxed equivalence, which asks the LLM to explain each query and compare their logic.

Experiments and Results:
- On challenging non-equivalent query pairs, "Miniature & Mull" prompting boosts accuracy to 100% from 60% with a basic prompt for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

- When judging SQL pairs from Spider dataset, LLM judgments align well with both execution match (70-90% agreement) and human preference (60-90%). GPT-4 gives better alignment than GPT-3.5.

- For semantic equivalence, execution match is accurate but sometimes misclassifies subtle cases. GPT-4 gives comparable or better judgments. 

- For relaxed equivalence, LLM judgments align better with human preference by capturing logic equivalences missed by execution match.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive study investigating LLMs for determining SQL equivalence. 

- Proposed prompting techniques that achieve high accuracy on challenging cases and good alignment with human notion of equivalence.

- Show LLMs can help data engineers write equivalent SQL and should replace execution match as eval metric for text-SQL.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that with suitable prompting, LLMs show promise in the challenging task of judging SQL query equivalence, both in assisting engineers and evaluating text-to-SQL systems. GPT-4 gives better results than GPT-3.5. There is still room for improvement to handle subtle logical cases.
