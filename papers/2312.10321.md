# [LLM-SQL-Solver: Can LLMs Determine SQL Equivalence?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10321)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Determining SQL query equivalence is an important but challenging task with applications in query optimization and evaluating text-to-SQL systems. However, it is theoretically undecidable in the general case.

- Existing solutions like Cosette have limited capabilities and don't support many common SQL features. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in logical reasoning tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors investigate whether LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can determine the equivalence between two SQL queries under two notions: semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence. 

- They propose two prompting techniques to assist the LLM: "Miniature & Mull" for semantic equivalence, which executes the queries on a simple database and asks if a counterexample can be constructed; and "Explain & Compare" for relaxed equivalence, which asks the LLM to explain each query and compare their logic.

Experiments and Results:
- On challenging non-equivalent query pairs, "Miniature & Mull" prompting boosts accuracy to 100% from 60% with a basic prompt for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

- When judging SQL pairs from Spider dataset, LLM judgments align well with both execution match (70-90% agreement) and human preference (60-90%). GPT-4 gives better alignment than GPT-3.5.

- For semantic equivalence, execution match is accurate but sometimes misclassifies subtle cases. GPT-4 gives comparable or better judgments. 

- For relaxed equivalence, LLM judgments align better with human preference by capturing logic equivalences missed by execution match.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive study investigating LLMs for determining SQL equivalence. 

- Proposed prompting techniques that achieve high accuracy on challenging cases and good alignment with human notion of equivalence.

- Show LLMs can help data engineers write equivalent SQL and should replace execution match as eval metric for text-SQL.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that with suitable prompting, LLMs show promise in the challenging task of judging SQL query equivalence, both in assisting engineers and evaluating text-to-SQL systems. GPT-4 gives better results than GPT-3.5. There is still room for improvement to handle subtle logical cases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies whether large language models can determine SQL query equivalence under semantic and relaxed notions, and proposes prompting techniques like "Miniature & Mull" and "Explain & Compare" to elicit better judgments from models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing two prompting techniques called "Miniature & Mull" and "Explain & Compare" to help large language models (LLMs) effectively determine the semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence of SQL queries. 

2. Evaluating the ability of LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in identifying SQL equivalence using challenging query pairs from existing benchmarks. The results show that with the right prompts, LLMs can successfully spot subtle differences between queries that human experts may miss.

3. Demonstrating that LLMs' judgement of relaxed SQL equivalence aligns better with human preference compared to the commonly used execution accuracy metric. This indicates that LLMs could be a better way to evaluate the quality of generated SQL queries from text-to-SQL systems.

4. Providing the first comprehensive study on whether LLMs can help with the fundamental but challenging problem of determining SQL query equivalence. The results are promising and open up new possibilities for using LLMs to assist database developers and optimize query processing.

In summary, the key innovation is in designing effective prompting strategies to unlock LLMs' potential for complex SQL reasoning tasks, and showing their viability as an automated SQL equivalence checker. This could have significant practical impact in addition to being a novel research direction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- SQL equivalence - The core problem studied in the paper is determining the equivalence between two SQL queries. Two notions of equivalence are defined: semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper investigates whether large language models like GPT can be used to judge SQL equivalence. Models tested include GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo.

- Prompting techniques - Two prompting techniques are proposed to help LLMs determine equivalence: "Miniature & Mull" for semantic equivalence and "Explain & Compare" for relaxed equivalence.

- Counterexamples - The idea of using counterexamples (database instances where two queries produce different outputs) to check semantic equivalence. This is incorporated into the Miniature & Mull prompting technique.

- Text-to-SQL - One application area explored is using LLM judgements of equivalence to evaluate text-to-SQL systems, as an alternative to execution accuracy.

- Alignment with human judgements - Experiments evaluate how well LLM judgements align with human expert opinions on SQL equivalence.

So in summary, key terms cover SQL equivalence, LLMs, prompting techniques, counterexamples, text-to-SQL evaluation, and alignment with human judgements.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two prompting techniques: Miniature & Mull and Explain & Compare. Can you elaborate on the intuition and reasoning behind designing these two techniques? How do they complement each other in evaluating semantic and relaxed equivalence respectively?

2. When using the Miniature & Mull technique, the paper asks the LM to first execute both SQL queries on a simple database instance. How is this initial simple database generated? What considerations should be made in the database design to facilitate detecting counterexamples? 

3. For complex SQL queries with nested subqueries or advanced SQL features like window functions, does the Miniature & Mull technique still work effectively? If not, how can it be adapted?

4. The Explain & Compare technique asks the LM to first explain the two SQL queries before determining if they are logically equivalent. Does the quality of the explanation impact the final judgement? Should the explanation be verified before proceeding?

5. Between GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo showcases better performance in determining SQL equivalence. What specific abilities of GPT-4 Turbo contribute to this improved performance? 

6. The relaxed equivalence notion is subjective and aims to capture a human user's perspective. But different human users may have differing judgements. How can the subjectivity be accounted for when using LMs to evaluate relaxed equivalence?

7. For the NL2SQL generation benchmarks tested, what types of SQL query differences tend to be judged incorrectly by LMs when compared to human judgement? Are there detectable patterns?

8. The agreement between LM judgements and execution match is generally high, except for some dissenting cases. What is the analysis on these dissenting cases? Which one tends to be more aligned with human judgement?

9. How efficient and scalable is using LMs as judge compared to other SQL verification methods? What are the bottlenecks when applying to large SQL workloads?

10. The paper focuses on semantic and relaxed equivalence. What other metrics related to SQL quality can LMs help evaluate? Can LMs judge the creativity, complexity or elegance of SQL queries?
