## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on energy-efficient design approaches for emerging edge artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It first introduces the three key tasks of edge AI: data acquisition for centralized edge learning, distributed edge model training, and edge model inference. Guided by the analysis of energy consumption breakdown in practical edge AI systems, general design principles are identified, including optimizing for energy efficiency, adapting to system dynamics, and trading intelligence performance for energy savings. Following these principles, the paper elaborates on methodologies to reduce energy consumption associated with the three critical edge AI tasks. For data acquisition, key techniques involve adaptive sensing and learning-aware data transmission. For distributed training, model and gradient compression as well as judicious resource management play pivotal roles. Regarding inference, major directions encompass model compression, neural architecture search, and input-adaptive execution. In addition, the paper highlights promising future research avenues such as integrated sensing and communication, hardware-software co-design, neuromorphic computing, and green energy-powered edge AI. In summary, this timely survey offers important guidelines and impactful visions toward enabling sustainable edge intelligence.
