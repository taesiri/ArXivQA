# [ESG Classification by Implicit Rule Learning via GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15040)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating companies on ESG (environmental, social, governance) factors is important for investors, but rating agencies keep their methodologies private. 
- This lack of transparency in evaluation criteria makes it challenging to train language models to accurately replicate these assessments.  
- Traditional language models like BERT rely heavily on large amounts of training data, which is lacking in this domain.

Proposed Solution:
- Use state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 and guide them to implicitly learn ESG evaluation rules without explicit training data.  
- Employ strategies like prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and dynamic in-context learning.
- Use prompts to encourage model to follow MSCI guidelines. Provide exemplars of desired behavior through in-context learning.

Experiments and Results:
- Tested approach on Shared Task ML-ESG-3's Korean dataset for classifying news into ESG impact types and durations.
- Ranked 2nd in Impact Type task, showcasing ability to implicitly capture patterns.
- Analysis revealed tendency to misclassify long texts with multiple implications.
- Tested impact of different prompts on smaller publicly available models. Longer pre-training correlated with better performance. 

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring guidance strategies to align language models with undisclosed ESG criteria without training data.
- Ranked 2nd in Shared Task ML-ESG-3 Korean Impact Type track using prompting and in-context learning.
- Analyzed effect of prompts on performance of smaller models in financial tasks. Showed value of general pre-training.
- Showcased potential for language models to handle complex subjective tasks by approximating implicit rules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates whether state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 can implicitly approximate unknown ESG evaluation criteria through strategies such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and dynamic in-context learning, and finds these approaches effective despite lacking explicit training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates whether state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 can effectively perform ESG classification tasks by approximating unknown evaluation criteria, without requiring explicit training data. The authors employ strategies like prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and dynamic in-context learning to guide the model, and demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches by ranking 2nd in the Shared-Task ML-ESG-3 Impact Type track for Korean without additional training. The paper also explores how adjusting prompts impacts smaller publicly available models' ability to address financial tasks, finding that longer general pre-training correlates with better performance. Overall, the work showcases the potential for language models to navigate complex subjective tasks like ESG evaluation despite lacking training examples, revealing opportunities for training-free financial applications.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating language models' ability to implicitly learn and approximate unknown or subjective criteria like ESG standards when guided properly, without needing explicit training data. This opens up possibilities for using them in financial applications without extensive labeled datasets.

The paper investigates using large language models like GPT-4 for ESG classification without explicit training data, by employing strategies like prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and in-context learning. It tests these methods by participating in the Shared Task ML-ESG-3 and examining the model's ability to predict impact type and duration. The paper also explores how different prompting strategies can affect smaller publicly available models on financial downstream tasks. Key terms cover ESG analysis, language models, few-shot learning approaches, and financial applications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and dynamic in-context learning to guide the GPT-4 model. Can you explain in more detail how each of these strategies works and how they were implemented? 

2. The paper ranks second in the Impact Type task but struggles with the Impact Duration task. What are some potential reasons why GPT-4 performed better on one task compared to the other? How might the approach be improved to better handle impact duration prediction?

3. The authors explore the efficacy of using smaller publicly available models like Yi-Ko-6B and EEVE-Korean-10.8B. How do the capabilities of these smaller models compare to GPT-4? What are the tradeoffs in using smaller versus larger language models for this task?

4. The paper finds that longer general pre-training correlates with better performance on financial downstream tasks. Why might this be the case? Can you explain the relationship between pre-training and performance on specialized downstream tasks?  

5. Could the methodology proposed in this paper be applied to other subjective text classification tasks beyond ESG analysis? What other areas might benefit from this approach?

6. The paper acknowledges issues with imbalanced training data distribution. How might the methodology account for and handle imbalanced datasets? Are there data augmentation or sampling techniques that could help?

7. The analysis explores model calibration using different prompts. Can you explain more about what calibration means, why it matters, and how prompts impact it? 

8. What other neural network architectures or modeling techniques could be explored for ESG classification besides the transformer-based models used in this work?

9. The paper is limited to Korean language texts. How might the approach transfer to other languages like English? Would any components of the methodology need to change?

10. What are some of the broader limitations and societal implications of using AI for ESG analysis? How might issues like bias be addressed?
