# [Genuine Knowledge from Practice: Diffusion Test-Time Adaptation for   Video Adverse Weather Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07684)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Real-world vision tasks often suffer from unexpected adverse weather conditions like rain, haze, and snow. Existing deep learning methods for video adverse weather removal typically perform well on weather conditions seen during training, but fail to generalize to unseen conditions at test time. Developing a method that can robustly handle diverse degradation types with a single model is an open challenge.

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a video adverse weather removal approach called Diff-TTA that integrates test-time adaptation into an iterative diffusion model reverse process. The key ideas are:

1) Diffusion-based network with temporal noise model: A diffusion model is designed to denoise temporally correlated video frames by estimating the noise from a novel temporal noise model that considers inter-frame dependencies. This is more efficient than large models.

2) Diffusion Test-Time Adaptation (Diff-TTA): At test time, a proxy task called Diffusion Tubelet Self-Calibration is incorporated into each diffusion timestep to adapt the model to the distribution of the test data degraded by unknown weather. Tubelet crops enable efficient adaptation.

3) Iterative adaptation accumulates frame knowledge: Integrating adaptation into the iterative diffusion sampling process allows for gradual accumulation of adapted knowledge across video frames.

Main Contributions:

- First diffusion-based model for generalizable video adverse weather removal using a single set of model weights  

- Novel temporal noise model to efficiently capture inter-frame correlations

- New test-time adaptation method Diff-TTA that leverages the iterative nature of diffusion models

- State-of-the-art performance on both seen and unseen adverse weather benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization ability

The method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance to remove diverse degradations like rain, haze and snow in videos. Experiments on synthetic and real videos with seen and unseen weather conditions validate the approach's effectiveness and generalization capability.
