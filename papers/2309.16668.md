# [RealFill: Reference-Driven Generation for Authentic Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16668)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we complete missing regions of an image with authentic content that faithfully reflects the actual scene, given a few reference images of that scene? The key hypotheses seem to be:1) By adapting a pre-trained generative model to a specific scene using reference images, the model can learn to generate content faithful to that scene. 2) Correspondences between generated completions and reference images can help identify high quality outputs that are consistent with the true scene.In summary, the main goal is to develop a method for "authentic image completion" that fills in missing image regions not just with plausible hallucinations but with content that accurately reflects the original real-world scene. The proposed method RealFill aims to achieve this by fine-tuning an inpainting diffusion model on reference images and using correspondences to filter outputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a method called RealFill for reference-driven image completion. Specifically:- It defines a new problem called "Authentic Image Completion", where the goal is to fill in missing regions of an image with content faithful to a set of reference images capturing the same scene. This is in contrast to typical image inpainting which hallucinates "plausible" content. - It proposes RealFill, which finetunes an inpainting diffusion model on the reference images to adapt it to the particular scene. This allows generating image completions consistent with the references.- It introduces correspondence-based seed selection to automatically filter low-quality samples based on lack of matches to the references.- It collects a new dataset called RealBench for evaluating authentic image completion with complex changes between references and target. Experiments show RealFill outperforms existing methods by a large margin.In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework for generating image completions that are authentic to a set of reference images, even when there are significant appearance variations between them. This is achieved by adapting an inpainting diffusion model to the specific input images.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes RealFill, a novel approach for authentic image completion that adapts an inpainting diffusion model using a few reference images of a scene to fill in missing regions of a target image with content faithful to the original scene, even when there are large differences between the reference and target images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this CVPR 2022 paper template compares to other research in computer vision:- The paper focuses on image completion, which is an active research area in computer vision. Other recent work has looked at image inpainting and outpainting using various techniques like deep learning models, GANs, transformers, etc. This paper proposes a new method called RealFill that takes a novel approach of fine-tuning a diffusion model on reference images.- Most prior work on image completion relies solely on the input image and mask. This paper introduces the idea of using reference images to guide the completion, which provides additional context about the true scene content. The proposed method is the first to show convincing completion results using multiple reference images, even with large appearance changes.- The problem formulated in the paper of "authentic image completion" is unique. Instead of just plausible/realistic content, the goal is to generate content faithful to the original scene as conveyed by the reference images. This is a new way of thinking about the image completion task.- The proposed correspondence-based seed selection method to identify high quality samples is clever. It takes advantage of the extra information provided by reference images in a completion setting. This is a nice contribution on its own for generative models.- The new RealBench dataset created for evaluation is useful because existing datasets don't cover the difficult cases tackled in this paper. RealBench will enable more thorough benchmarking of image completion techniques.- The comparisons to strong baselines like image stitching, vanilla DreamBooth and others provide convincing evidence that RealFill produces better results on this challenging problem. The analyses investigating why RealFill works are also insightful.Overall, I think this paper makes excellent contributions to the field of image completion by introducing a novel approach, new problem definition, and compelling results on difficult cases. The ideas like leveraging reference images and correspondence-based sampling are innovative.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel generative approach called RealFill for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with content that should have been there, rather than just plausible content. Given a target image with a missing region and a few reference images capturing the same scene, RealFill first fine-tunes a pre-trained inpainting diffusion model on the inputs to adapt it to the specific scene. This adapted model is then sampled to fill in the missing region of the target image. To improve result quality, a correspondence-based seed selection method is proposed that ranks sample outputs based on the number of matched features with the reference images. Experiments demonstrate that RealFill produces more realistic and authentic completions compared to existing inpainting methods, even when there are large differences in viewpoint, lighting, and other factors between the reference and target images. The method is evaluated on a new dataset of diverse image completion examples. Key benefits are the ability to leverage multiple reference images and the faithfulness of completions to the true scene content.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a new method called RealFill for authentically completing missing regions of an image using a few reference images of the same scene. The key idea is to fine-tune a pre-trained inpainting diffusion model on both the reference images and target image in order to adapt the model to the specific scene. This allows the model to generate missing content that is faithful to what was actually captured in the references, rather than just plausible hallucinations. Specifically, the method takes a target image, binary mask indicating missing regions, and up to 5 reference images as input. It injects learnable residual modules into a pre-trained text-conditional inpainting diffusion model, then fine-tunes this model on masked versions of the references and target. This adapts the model to the scene while retaining a strong image prior. The fine-tuned model is then sampled conditioned on the target and mask to fill in the missing regions. A correspondence-based seed selection method is used to automatically filter out low-quality samples. Experiments demonstrate that RealFill produces compelling results on challenging inpainting and outpainting tasks with large changes in viewpoint, lighting, etc. between references and target. It outperforms existing methods on a new benchmark for authentic image completion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel generative approach called RealFill for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with content that should have been there, based on a few reference images. The method first fine-tunes a pre-trained inpainting diffusion model on the set of reference images and the target image with random maskings. This adapts the model to learn the contents, lighting, and style of the input scene while maintaining a good image prior. The fine-tuned model is then sampled conditioned on the target image and mask to fill in the missing regions. To improve result quality, the method proposes correspondence-based seed selection, which filters out poor samples based on the number of matched features between the generated content and reference images. Overall, RealFill produces compelling image completions that are faithful to the original scene captured in the references, even when there are large differences in viewpoint, lighting, etc. between the images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Investigate the potential risks of image generation technology more thoroughly. The authors note that their method inherits some of the concerns associated with generative models like Stable Diffusion, such as the ability to alter sensitive personal characteristics. They call for more research focused on mitigating bias and harmful content in image generation models.- Develop methods to make image generation more responsible and ethical. The authors state that it is important to ensure image generation tools are used appropriately by society. This suggests a need for techniques that provide better control over image generation to avoid misuse.- Improve image completion for more complex 3D scenes. The authors found their method sometimes fails to accurately recover 3D structure from dramatic viewpoint changes between reference and target images. They suggest more work on faithfully completing images in complex 3D settings.- Enhance detail generation like text and faces. Since their approach relies on the prior of Stable Diffusion, it inherits difficulties generating fine details. The authors suggest improving detail synthesis as an area for future work.- Make image completion faster and closer to real-time. The authors note their method requires relatively slow fine-tuning for each set of input images. They suggest increasing the speed as a direction for improvement.- Develop better automatic evaluation of image generation quality. The authors propose correspondence-based selection of good samples, but note evaluating generative image sample quality remains an open challenge worthy of further research.In summary, the main future directions involve developing more responsible and capable image completion, improving detail synthesis and speed, and creating better techniques to automatically assess the quality of generative image models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of authentically completing missing regions of an image, given a few reference images of the same scene. More specifically:- The problem they define is called "Authentic Image Completion". Given a target image with missing regions, and a few reference images capturing roughly the same scene, the goal is to fill in the missing regions of the target image with content that is faithful to what was actually in the original scene, based on the reference images. - This is contrasted with typical image inpainting/outpainting methods, which can hallucinate plausible but fabricated content in the missing regions, since they lack knowledge of the true scene.- The key question is how to leverage the reference images, which may differ significantly from the target image in viewpoint, lighting, style, etc., in order to generate authentic completions that recover the genuine content of the scene.In summary, the paper focuses on the problem of authentic image completion given reference images, in order to fill in missing image regions with content faithful to the true captured scene, even when the references differ dramatically from the target image. This contrasts with prior work which produces plausible but fabricated content, and addresses the question of how to effectively utilize varied reference images to guide authentic completion.
