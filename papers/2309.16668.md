# [RealFill: Reference-Driven Generation for Authentic Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16668)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we complete missing regions of an image with authentic content that faithfully reflects the actual scene, given a few reference images of that scene? The key hypotheses seem to be:1) By adapting a pre-trained generative model to a specific scene using reference images, the model can learn to generate content faithful to that scene. 2) Correspondences between generated completions and reference images can help identify high quality outputs that are consistent with the true scene.In summary, the main goal is to develop a method for "authentic image completion" that fills in missing image regions not just with plausible hallucinations but with content that accurately reflects the original real-world scene. The proposed method RealFill aims to achieve this by fine-tuning an inpainting diffusion model on reference images and using correspondences to filter outputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a method called RealFill for reference-driven image completion. Specifically:- It defines a new problem called "Authentic Image Completion", where the goal is to fill in missing regions of an image with content faithful to a set of reference images capturing the same scene. This is in contrast to typical image inpainting which hallucinates "plausible" content. - It proposes RealFill, which finetunes an inpainting diffusion model on the reference images to adapt it to the particular scene. This allows generating image completions consistent with the references.- It introduces correspondence-based seed selection to automatically filter low-quality samples based on lack of matches to the references.- It collects a new dataset called RealBench for evaluating authentic image completion with complex changes between references and target. Experiments show RealFill outperforms existing methods by a large margin.In summary, the key contribution is a novel framework for generating image completions that are authentic to a set of reference images, even when there are significant appearance variations between them. This is achieved by adapting an inpainting diffusion model to the specific input images.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes RealFill, a novel approach for authentic image completion that adapts an inpainting diffusion model using a few reference images of a scene to fill in missing regions of a target image with content faithful to the original scene, even when there are large differences between the reference and target images.
