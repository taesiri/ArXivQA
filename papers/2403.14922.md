# [CODA: A COst-efficient Test-time Domain Adaptation Mechanism for HAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14922)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Human activity recognition (HAR) systems suffer performance degradation when deployed in real-world dynamic conditions due to distribution shifts. 
- Existing solutions use one-off adaptation schemes based on neural networks which struggle to handle continual drifts in human-centric sensing scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CODA, a lightweight test-time domain adaptation framework that addresses drifts from a data distribution perspective using active learning theory. 
- CODA uses a simple nearest neighbor classifier and dynamically adapts it at test time by evaluating instance importance and updating the model in an online manner.
- It incorporates a clustering loss function and an importance-weighted active learning algorithm to retain relationships between clusters during cost-effective instance-level updates.

Key Contributions:
- First continual test-time adaptation framework integrated with active learning for mobile sensing.
- Comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets showing CODA's robustness against uncertainty without trainable parameters.
- Analysis of adaptation capabilities under varying real-world conditions like feedback frequency, devices, features etc.
- Demonstration of feasibility and potential of online adaptation through a simple and lightweight cache-based structure.
- Suggestion that application-specific designs with sufficient feedback can enable unobtrusive adaptation.

In summary, the paper proposes CODA, a novel lightweight online adaptation technique to handle drifts in HAR by framing it as a data distribution shift problem and leveraging active learning. Through evaluations on multiple datasets, the paper demonstrates CODA's effectiveness and potential for practical deployment.
