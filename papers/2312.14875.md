# [Automating the Design of Multigrid Methods with Evolutionary Program   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on automating the design of efficient multigrid methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) numerically. Multigrid methods have the potential to solve many PDEs optimally. However, designing an efficient multigrid solver for a given PDE is challenging and requires significant expertise and effort. Existing approaches for automating multigrid design have limitations, as they only optimize parameters of fixed structures and cannot discover novel algorithms.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel grammar-based approach that can automatically generate arbitrary sequences of multigrid operations using principles from formal language theory and evolutionary program synthesis. A context-free grammar is derived that can express multigrid methods as computational graphs. Evolutionary algorithms are then used to search this grammar-based space to find well-performing multigrid solvers. 

The approach has several key aspects:
(1) A state representation for multigrid methods based on a hierarchy of discretization levels. 
(2) State transition functions that update the state after each multigrid operation.
(3) A context-free grammar built using these functions that can generate arbitrary multigrid sequences. 
(4) An evolutionary algorithm that searches this grammar space, evaluating solvers on proxy problems.
(5) A generalization procedure that evolves the population over sequences of increasingly difficult problem instances.

The proposed methods are implemented in a framework called EvoStencils. It integrates DEAP for evolutionary computation with ExaStencils for automatic code generation. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is used to parallelize the method.

Main Contributions:
- A novel state representation and context-free grammar for expressing arbitrary sequences of multigrid operations. This allows complete flexibility in designing multigrid algorithms.

- An evolutionary program synthesis approach built using this grammar that can automatically discover novel and complex multigrid solvers unexplored in literature.

- A generalization procedure tailored for multigrid methods that can evolve them over sequences of proxy problems to produce widely applicable solvers.

- An implementation demonstrating the feasibility of this approach, using DEAP, ExaStencils and MPI. Publicly available as open-source software.

- Experiments on model problems and the challenging indefinite Helmholtz equation that discover unconventional multigrid solvers that significantly outperform classical cycles.

The paper presents a pioneering application of automated algorithm design to numerically solving PDEs. By automatically designing complex multigrid solvers, it pushes the boundaries of what is possible with little human effort. The principles proposed could be extended to other numerical solvers too.
