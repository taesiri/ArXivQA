# [Towards Semi-supervised Learning with Non-random Missing Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08872)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective semi-supervised learning method that can handle the challenging but practical scenario of label Missing Not At Random (MNAR)? The key hypothesesappear to be:1) The pseudo-rectifying ability of standard semi-supervised methods deteriorates in the MNAR setting where labeled and unlabeled data have mismatched class distributions. This leads to biased label imputation and poor model performance.2) Tracking class transitions in the pseudo-labels during training can provide useful guidance information to help rectify pseudo-labels in a less biased way, even in the presence of mismatched distributions. 3) Modeling class transitions as a Markov random walk on a graph built from a class transition matrix can capture useful information about class relationships and tendencies that can guide the pseudo-rectifying process.4) Rescaling the transition matrix based on class distribution statistics of the pseudo-labels can further reduce bias and improve pseudo-label quality, especially for rare classes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly tracking and modeling class transitions can enable more effective semi-supervised learning under the challenging but practical MNAR scenario compared to existing methods. The proposed Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) method is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a method called Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) to address semi-supervised learning with non-random missing labels (MNAR). The key contributions are:- It proposes to track class transitions in the pseudo-labeling process to build a graph that captures relationships between classes. This allows exploiting historical information to guide future pseudo-labeling.- It models the class transitions using a Markov random walk on the graph. This results in a transition matrix that provides probabilistic guidance on how pseudo-labels should transition between classes. - The transition matrix is dynamically updated and scaled based on the current class distribution. This allows providing implicit guidance to assign more pseudo-labels to rare classes, alleviating issues with MNAR.- The overall method provides a simple and effective way to exploit historical class transition information to guide the pseudo-labeling process without needing extra networks or training overhead.- Experiments show PRG substantially improves performance over previous SSL methods in various MNAR settings, demonstrating its ability to address issues with mismatched label distributions.In summary, the key novelty is using dynamic class transition tracking and guidance to make SSL more robust to non-random missing labels, which is a very practical but under-studied scenario.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a class transition tracking based method called Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) to address the problem of semi-supervised learning with mismatched class distributions between labeled and unlabeled data (label Missing Not At Random).


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in semi-supervised learning:- This paper focuses specifically on the problem of label missing not at random (MNAR), where the labeled and unlabeled data come from mismatched distributions. This is a relatively new topic compared to most SSL research which assumes matched distributions. - The proposed method PRG handles MNAR by tracking class transitions in the pseudo-labels and using that to guide the model's rectification process. This differs from other MNAR methods like CADR which tries to debias the model more directly. It is a novel way to exploit the pseudo-labeling dynamics.- PRG is compared extensively to prior state-of-the-art SSL methods like FixMatch and SimMatch. It shows superior performance under various MNAR protocols, demonstrating its effectiveness on this problem.- The idea of modeling class transitions as a Markov process and using that for guidance seems unique to this paper. Prior SSL work doesn't really analyze pseudo-label transitions in this way.- PRG is applied by plugging into standard SSL frameworks like FixMatch. So it extends common SSL pipelines to handle MNAR. Other MNAR methods require more specialized modeling.- Unlike some recent SSL techniques, PRG doesn't rely on complex components like graph neural networks or adversarial training. This allows it to be efficient and simple to implement.Overall, this paper makes a nice contribution in addressing an important practical problem in SSL through a novel technique based on pseudo-label dynamics. The strength of its results and simplicity of the approach are notable compared to existing literature.
