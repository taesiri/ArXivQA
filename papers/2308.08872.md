# [Towards Semi-supervised Learning with Non-random Missing Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08872)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective semi-supervised learning method that can handle the challenging but practical scenario of label Missing Not At Random (MNAR)? 

The key hypothesesappear to be:

1) The pseudo-rectifying ability of standard semi-supervised methods deteriorates in the MNAR setting where labeled and unlabeled data have mismatched class distributions. This leads to biased label imputation and poor model performance.

2) Tracking class transitions in the pseudo-labels during training can provide useful guidance information to help rectify pseudo-labels in a less biased way, even in the presence of mismatched distributions. 

3) Modeling class transitions as a Markov random walk on a graph built from a class transition matrix can capture useful information about class relationships and tendencies that can guide the pseudo-rectifying process.

4) Rescaling the transition matrix based on class distribution statistics of the pseudo-labels can further reduce bias and improve pseudo-label quality, especially for rare classes.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly tracking and modeling class transitions can enable more effective semi-supervised learning under the challenging but practical MNAR scenario compared to existing methods. The proposed Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) method is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a method called Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) to address semi-supervised learning with non-random missing labels (MNAR). The key contributions are:

- It proposes to track class transitions in the pseudo-labeling process to build a graph that captures relationships between classes. This allows exploiting historical information to guide future pseudo-labeling.

- It models the class transitions using a Markov random walk on the graph. This results in a transition matrix that provides probabilistic guidance on how pseudo-labels should transition between classes. 

- The transition matrix is dynamically updated and scaled based on the current class distribution. This allows providing implicit guidance to assign more pseudo-labels to rare classes, alleviating issues with MNAR.

- The overall method provides a simple and effective way to exploit historical class transition information to guide the pseudo-labeling process without needing extra networks or training overhead.

- Experiments show PRG substantially improves performance over previous SSL methods in various MNAR settings, demonstrating its ability to address issues with mismatched label distributions.

In summary, the key novelty is using dynamic class transition tracking and guidance to make SSL more robust to non-random missing labels, which is a very practical but under-studied scenario.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a class transition tracking based method called Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) to address the problem of semi-supervised learning with mismatched class distributions between labeled and unlabeled data (label Missing Not At Random).


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in semi-supervised learning:

- This paper focuses specifically on the problem of label missing not at random (MNAR), where the labeled and unlabeled data come from mismatched distributions. This is a relatively new topic compared to most SSL research which assumes matched distributions. 

- The proposed method PRG handles MNAR by tracking class transitions in the pseudo-labels and using that to guide the model's rectification process. This differs from other MNAR methods like CADR which tries to debias the model more directly. It is a novel way to exploit the pseudo-labeling dynamics.

- PRG is compared extensively to prior state-of-the-art SSL methods like FixMatch and SimMatch. It shows superior performance under various MNAR protocols, demonstrating its effectiveness on this problem.

- The idea of modeling class transitions as a Markov process and using that for guidance seems unique to this paper. Prior SSL work doesn't really analyze pseudo-label transitions in this way.

- PRG is applied by plugging into standard SSL frameworks like FixMatch. So it extends common SSL pipelines to handle MNAR. Other MNAR methods require more specialized modeling.

- Unlike some recent SSL techniques, PRG doesn't rely on complex components like graph neural networks or adversarial training. This allows it to be efficient and simple to implement.

Overall, this paper makes a nice contribution in addressing an important practical problem in SSL through a novel technique based on pseudo-label dynamics. The strength of its results and simplicity of the approach are notable compared to existing literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop more advanced methods to model the class transitions and similarity relationships between classes for providing pseudo-rectifying guidance. The authors use a simple Markov random walk model in this work, but mention that more complex graph-based algorithms could potentially capture richer relational information between classes from the history of class transitions.

- Explore how to best combine the proposed pseudo-rectifying guidance approach with other existing methods for handling class imbalance or mismatched distributions. The authors show promising results by adding their method on top of baseline SSL algorithms, but more work could be done to integrate it tightly into model training.

- Apply and evaluate the proposed approach on more diverse and complex real-world datasets beyond image classification. The authors demonstrate results on standard SSL image benchmarks, but suggest the method could generalize to other data types and application scenarios with missing label challenges.

- Develop theoretical understandings to explain when and why providing guidance based on historical class transitions can improve model training under mismatched distributions. The authors' approach is intuitively motivated but lacks formal analysis.

- Study how to dynamically adjust the guidance during training as the model evolves, rather than using fixed parametrizations. For example, adaptively controlling the intensity of class transitions.

- Explore different ways to represent and quantify class relationships beyond symmetric pairwise misclassification rates, to capture more nuanced semantic similarities.

Overall, the authors propose a novel direction and demonstrate promising initial results, but suggest substantial future work to understand and improve pseudo-rectifying guidance for semi-supervised learning with mismatched distributions. Theoretic analysis and more sophisticated algorithms seem to be open research challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning method to address the challenging but practical scenario of label Missing Not At Random (MNAR), where labeled and unlabeled data fall into different class distributions. The proposed Class Transition tracking based Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) leverages historical information about class transitions caused by the model's pseudo-rectifying process to provide guidance for future label assignments. Specifically, a Markov random walk is modeled on a graph built over the class transition matrix to capture relationships between classes. This allows PRG to guide the pseudo-rectifying process by perturbing some confident class predictions based on transition probabilities, helping improve pseudo-label quality for both popular and rare classes under MNAR. Experiments demonstrate superior performance of PRG over latest methods in various MNAR settings. The approach helps mitigate biased label assignment without requiring additional network components. Key benefits are the ability to handle MNAR without relying on matched class distribution assumptions and improved pseudo-rectifying ability by preserving awareness of rare classes based on transition history.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) to improve semi-supervised learning when there is a mismatch between the class distributions of the labeled and unlabeled data (a setting called MNAR). In MNAR, standard semi-supervised learning methods will be biased towards the popular classes in the labeled data and ignore the rare classes. PRG helps address this issue by tracking the history of class transitions for the pseudo-labels on the unlabeled data. These transitions occur when the model corrects a previous incorrect pseudo-label prediction during training. PRG models this as a Markov random walk on a graph to capture the relationships between easily confused classes. Then during training, it uses the transition matrix to probabilistically guide the pseudo-labeling to preserve transitions between rare and popular classes. This helps maintain the model's ability to rectify pseudo-labels across all classes. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate PRG substantially improves accuracy over standard semi-supervised learning methods and recent approaches designed for MNAR.

In more detail, PRG first builds a graph over the classes based on a matrix tracking the frequency of transitions between different pseudo-label predictions over the training iterations. This captures relationships between classes the model tends to confuse. A Markov random walk is modeled on the graph to represent the class transition probabilities. During training, PRG rescales the transition matrix based on the class distribution of current pseudo-labels to provide guidance reflecting any bias. For each unlabeled sample, it perturbs the model's predicted pseudo-label using the transition probability vector corresponding to the current predicted class. This preserves transitions between popular and rare classes to improve pseudo-label quality. PRG is evaluated on image classification datasets under different MNAR settings. It consistently achieves substantial gains over standard semi-supervised learning methods and recent approaches targeted at handling MNAR.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) to address semi-supervised learning with non-random missing labels (MNAR). The key idea is to track class transitions in the pseudo-labels during training and use that information to guide the model's pseudo-label predictions. 

Specifically, a class tracking matrix is maintained to record the frequency of transitions between different class predictions for the same sample across training epochs. This captures the tendency for the model to confuse certain classes with each other. A Markov random walk is then modeled on a graph built from the tracking matrix to capture transition probabilities between classes. 

During training, the current class prediction for an unlabeled sample is used to look up the corresponding transition probability distribution over classes from the random walk model. This distribution is re-weighted based on the number of pseudo-labels assigned to each class and used to rescale the original predicted pseudo-label vector. The rescaled vector guides the model's training on unlabeled data. This perturbation based on class transition history helps improve pseudo-label quality and maintain the model's ability to rectify labels, addressing the bias issues in MNAR.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised learning (SSL) when the class distributions of labeled and unlabeled data are mismatched, which they refer to as the "label Missing Not At Random" (MNAR) scenario. 

The key questions/problems addressed are:

- Most existing SSL methods assume the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution. However, in many real-world cases, the labeled data may be skewed towards certain classes while the unlabeled data is more balanced. This MNAR scenario causes issues for standard SSL methods.

- The mismatched distributions cause biased label predictions on the unlabeled data, which gets reinforced over training. This deteriorates the model's ability to "pseudo-rectify" incorrect labels.

- How can we enable semi-supervised learning algorithms to work effectively under the challenging but realistic MNAR setting?

To summarize, the main problem is that mismatched labeled/unlabeled data distributions degrade performance of standard SSL methods. The paper aims to develop an approach to enable SSL under this MNAR scenario.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Semi-supervised learning (SSL): The paper focuses on semi-supervised learning, which leverages both labeled and unlabeled data for training.

- Missing labels: The paper deals with the problem of missing (unlabeled) data, where the labeled and unlabeled data may come from different distributions. 

- Missing not at random (MNAR): A key scenario explored is when the missing labels are "not at random" (MNAR), meaning the labeled and unlabeled data have mismatched distributions.

- Pseudo-labeling: A common SSL technique of assigning "pseudo-labels" to unlabeled data, which can be biased under MNAR.

- Pseudo-rectifying: The process of a model changing/correcting the pseudo-labels for a sample during training as it learns.

- Class transition: When a pseudo-label prediction changes from one class to another between epochs due to pseudo-rectifying.

- Class transition tracking: Recording class transitions of pseudo-labels to capture relationships between classes. 

- Markov random walk: Modeling the class transitions as a Markov process on a graph built from the transitions.

- Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG): The proposed method to provide guidance on pseudo-label correction based on class transition tracking and Markov random walk modeling.

- Bias removal: A goal of PRG is to remove bias in pseudo-labeling under MNAR by preserving rectifying ability.

So in summary, it tackles semi-supervised learning in the challenging MNAR setting via pseudo-rectifying guidance based on class transition modeling.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes modeling class transitions using a Markov random walk on a graph built from the class tracking matrix. How sensitive is the performance to the structure of the graph? Does using a fully connected graph capture all necessary relationships or would a different graph structure such as only connecting classes that are commonly confused be better?

2. The class tracking matrix records the frequency of transitions between each pair of classes based on pseudo-label changes over recent training batches. How is the number of batches to track determined? Does performance improve by tracking over more batches or is there a sweet spot?

3. The paper mentions the possibility of using higher powers of the transition matrix H' (i.e. H'^2, H'^3, etc.) instead of just H' to uncover more complex patterns of misclassification. However, experiments found lower performance with higher powers of H'. Why might this occur and could adaptive selection of the power provide benefits? 

4. How does the performance vary with different values of the class invariance coefficient α? Is there an optimal value or range across different datasets and levels of class imbalance? How does it interact with the other re-weighting of H?

5. The paper re-weights the rows of the transition matrix H by the relative frequency of each class in recent pseudo-labels. How important is this re-weighting versus using the raw empirically observed transition frequencies? Does it primarily help in highly imbalanced settings?

6. Could the class tracking mechanism be improved by using knowledge of semantic class similarities, either derived empirically or from human knowledge, to connect classes in the graph beyond those frequently confused?

7. The method is primarily evaluated on image classification. How well does it transfer to other data types such as text or tabular data? Does the concept of class transitions still work effectively in those domains?

8. How does the method perform in the standard semi-supervised learning setting with class balanced labeled and unlabeled data? Does the pseudo-rectifying guidance still provide benefits or is it primarily useful for non-random missing label scenarios?

9. The paper focuses on classification, but could similar class transition tracking and guidance mechanisms be developed for semi-supervised regression or structured prediction tasks like semantic segmentation?

10. The method provides rectifying guidance based on previous epochs' training. Could an online adaptation approach work better? Or does the aggregation over batches help smooth out noise and provide more robust guidance?
