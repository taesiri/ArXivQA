# [ViscoNet: Bridging and Harmonizing Visual and Textual Conditioning for   ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling image structure like human pose in text-to-image models is challenging due to ambiguity in natural language descriptions. Lengthy text prompts are needed to specify human appearance details. 
- Conflicts can arise between specialized text-conditioning branches (e.g. ControlNet) trained on small datasets and the pre-trained backbone model (e.g. Stable Diffusion), leading to mode collapse.
- Lack of fine-grained visual conditioning beyond spatial maps to precisely control visual attributes.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce ViscoNet - a visual conditioning enhancement to ControlNet without changing underlying architecture. 
- Replace text embedding in ControlNet with image embedding from segmented fashion images to enable precise appearance control.
- Apply control feature masking and control strength scaling to restrict background influence and balance branch vs backbone.  

Main Contributions:
- Enables precise visual control over human generation through image conditioning while retaining text control of backgrounds/composition.
- Allows learning from small datasets without losing generative diversity of backbone model.
- Avoid mode collapse through disentangled text/image conditioning and tuning control signal strengths.
- Demonstrates controllable stylized human generation, DeepFakes, virtual try-on, pose transfer while maintaining identity.

In summary, ViscoNet enhances control over human image generation by disentangling visual attributes from the backbone model through segmented image conditioning. This provides precise appearance control and avoids dataset gaps leading to mode collapse. The result is controllable, creative and consistent human image synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces ViscoNet, a novel method that enhances text-to-image human generation models with visual prompting to enable precise control over visual attributes while retaining the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of ViscoNet are:

1. Adding visual conditioning capability to ControlNet for precise and consistent visual control.

2. Applying human mask in model training that is effective in learning from small datasets without overfitting and hence losing backbone LDMs generative capability. 

3. A novel method to regulate and harmonize the textual and visual conditioning to control image style and avoid mode collapse.

In summary, the key contributions are enhancing ControlNet with visual conditioning, using masking to enable learning from small datasets, and balancing textual and visual conditioning to avoid issues like mode collapse. The method focuses on controllable high-quality stylized human image generation.
