# [ViscoNet: Bridging and Harmonizing Visual and Textual Conditioning for   ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling image structure like human pose in text-to-image models is challenging due to ambiguity in natural language descriptions. Lengthy text prompts are needed to specify human appearance details. 
- Conflicts can arise between specialized text-conditioning branches (e.g. ControlNet) trained on small datasets and the pre-trained backbone model (e.g. Stable Diffusion), leading to mode collapse.
- Lack of fine-grained visual conditioning beyond spatial maps to precisely control visual attributes.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce ViscoNet - a visual conditioning enhancement to ControlNet without changing underlying architecture. 
- Replace text embedding in ControlNet with image embedding from segmented fashion images to enable precise appearance control.
- Apply control feature masking and control strength scaling to restrict background influence and balance branch vs backbone.  

Main Contributions:
- Enables precise visual control over human generation through image conditioning while retaining text control of backgrounds/composition.
- Allows learning from small datasets without losing generative diversity of backbone model.
- Avoid mode collapse through disentangled text/image conditioning and tuning control signal strengths.
- Demonstrates controllable stylized human generation, DeepFakes, virtual try-on, pose transfer while maintaining identity.

In summary, ViscoNet enhances control over human image generation by disentangling visual attributes from the backbone model through segmented image conditioning. This provides precise appearance control and avoids dataset gaps leading to mode collapse. The result is controllable, creative and consistent human image synthesis.
