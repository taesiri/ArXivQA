# [Leveraging Demonstrator-perceived Precision for Safe Interactive   Imitation Learning of Clearance-limited Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13466)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interactive imitation learning (IIL) allows robots to efficiently learn policies from human demonstrations through online interactions. However, deploying unmatured policies during IIL poses safety risks for clearance-limited robotic tasks (e.g. assembly), where collisions can easily occur.
- To ensure safety, robots need to be aware of collision risks and request human intervention. But estimating such risks requires knowing the environmental precision (e.g. clearance between objects), which is unavailable in model-free IIL methods.

Proposed Solution: 
- The key idea is to estimate precision information from the demonstrations themselves. Humans demonstrate slower speeds in high precision areas to avoid collisions, reflecting their perceived level of precision.
- The paper proposes Demonstrator-perceived Precision-aware IIL (DPIIL) which captures precision from the speed-accuracy trade-off exhibited in demonstrations. This precision is combined with uncertainty in the learned policy to estimate collision risks.
- DPIIL cedes control to a human demonstrator to avoid collisions when traversing high-risk states, enhancing safety during policy learning.

Main Contributions:
- A novel method to estimate collision risks from demonstrator-perceived precision without needing an environment model.
- A safe interactive imitation learning algorithm DPIIL which uses estimated risks to request human takeovers for safety.
- Evaluations in clearance-limited simulations (aperture passing, peg insertion) and real-robot experiments (UR5e arm) which demonstrate significantly improved training safety compared to prior IIL methods.

In summary, the key novelty is estimating precision for model-free IIL tasks to enable safe policy learning through human-robot interaction, with applications in improving safety for industrial assembly robots.
