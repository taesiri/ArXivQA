# [GreenLLaMA: A Framework for Detoxification with Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15951)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Prior works on text detoxification are limited as they focus only on seen platforms, do not provide explanations for toxicity, fail to handle non-detoxifiability cases, and struggle with adversarial attacks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes \xdetox, an end-to-end framework for text detoxification that addresses the above limitations.

- \xdetox uses ChatGPT to create a cross-platform pseudo-parallel corpus of toxic and non-toxic text pairs with explanation and paraphrase labels. 

- Suite of detoxification models are trained on this corpus and evaluated. The best model uses chain-of-thought prompting to first generate an explanation of toxicity before producing the non-toxic text.

- A dedicated paraphrase detector is incorporated to warn users when non-detoxifiability alters meaning.

Main Contributions:

- First comprehensive detoxification framework handling cross-platform data, explanation, non-detoxifiability and adversarial attacks

- Novel cross-platform pseudo-parallel corpus generation using ChatGPT

- State-of-the-art detoxification model outperforming previous models

- Analysis showing framework's effectiveness on implicit hate speech and adversarial attacks

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end detoxification framework called \xdetox that addresses key limitations in prior works through cross-platform modeling, toxicity explanations, non-detoxifiability handling and robustness to attacks. The main innovation is the creation and use of a new pseudo-parallel corpus spanning diverse platforms.
