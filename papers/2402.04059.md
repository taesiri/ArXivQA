# [Deep Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multivariate time series data collected in real-world scenarios often contain missing values due to various reasons like sensor failures or privacy concerns. These missing values can significantly hinder effective analysis and decision making based on the time series data. Recently, deep learning methods have shown remarkable success in imputing missing values, but there lacks a systematic review of these methods.

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning methods for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI). The key contributions include:

1) Proposes a novel taxonomy to categorize MTSI methods based on two perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Imputation uncertainty reflects confidence in the imputed values. The taxonomy covers major deep learning models like RNNs, CNNs, attention models, VAEs, GANs and diffusion models. 

2) Provides a structured review of predictive methods (offering fixed estimates) and generative methods (providing distribution of possible values to account for uncertainty). Discusses pros and cons of each category.

3) Conducts extensive experiments to evaluate different methods on three real-world datasets. Examines imputation accuracy and improvement on downstream classification task. Analyzes time and memory complexity.

4) Identifies promising future directions, including handling complex missing mechanisms, unified representations for downstream tasks, improving scalability, and incorporating large language models.

In summary, this is the first comprehensive survey focused specifically on deep learning methods for multivariate time series imputation. The novel taxonomy, detailed methodological review, thorough empirical analysis and discussion of open challenges significantly contribute to stimulating further research in this important field.
