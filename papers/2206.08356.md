# [OmniMAE: Single Model Masked Pretraining on Images and Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

Can a single, unified transformer model be trained to perform well on both image and video recognition tasks? 

The authors hypothesize that by using masked autoencoding as the pretraining objective, they can train a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) model jointly on images and videos that will learn good general visual representations. This is in contrast to prior work that trains specialized models separately for images vs videos, or requires modified transformer architectures tailored for computer vision.

The key ideas explored are:

- Using masked autoencoding for self-supervised pretraining, where a percentage of image/video patches are masked out and the model must reconstruct them. This allows pretraining without human annotations.

- Showing that a simple ViT model can work effectively for both images and videos when trained this way, despite having no built-in inductive biases for computer vision like some other architectures.

- Demonstrating that joint pretraining on images and videos improves transfer performance on downstream tasks compared to models trained on a single modality.

- Using very high masking ratios during pretraining (e.g. 90% images, 95% video) to substantially reduce training compute and enable scaling to larger models.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that masked pretraining enables a single vanilla ViT model to achieve strong performance on both images and videos, which they verify through extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:

- Proposing OmniMAE, a single Vision Transformer model for images and videos trained with masked autoencoding. Previous work has focused on separate models for each modality. 

- Showing that masked autoencoding can effectively pretrain a unified model on multiple visual modalities. Prior attempts at joint modeling have typically required specialized architectures or resulted in worse performance.

- Demonstrating that OmniMAE achieves strong performance on both image and video recognition benchmarks, comparable or better than specialized single-modality models, using just a simple Vision Transformer architecture.

- Enabling training of large OmniMAE models by using extremely high masking ratios of 90% on images and 95% on videos to reduce computation and memory usage substantially.

- Analyzing design choices like masking strategies, decoder architecture, dataset ratios, etc. to understand what works best for joint masked pretraining across modalities.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and analyzing OmniMAE, a single masked autoencoder model that achieves strong performance on both images and videos using just a simple Transformer architecture. The joint training enables unified modeling across visual modalities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes OmniMAE, a single Masked Autoencoder Transformer model trained on images and videos using masked reconstruction that achieves strong performance on downstream tasks in both modalities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in the same field:

- The paper focuses on training a single unified vision transformer model for both images and videos using masked autoencoding. This is a relatively new direction compared to much prior work that trains specialized models for each modality. 

- Most prior work on self-supervised representation learning has focused on either images (e.g. MAE, BEiT, DINO) or videos (e.g. VideoMAE, MaskedFeatV, BEVT) separately. There has been little work exploring joint self-supervised pretraining on both images and videos in a unified model.

- The concurrent work PolyViT does jointly train on images, videos and audio with a shared transformer encoder. However, PolyViT uses supervised pretraining objectives while this work relies only on unsupervised masked autoencoding.

- Another concurrent work, BEVT, also explores joint masked modeling of images and videos using a Swin transformer. However, it requires a separate tokenizer trained on images first. This work uses a simpler vanilla Vision Transformer architecture without any specialized inductive biases. 

- Compared to methods like Omnivore and PolyViT that require multi-head architectures and supervised pretraining, this work presents a simpler approach for unified modeling of visual modalities using only unsupervised masked reconstruction.

- The extreme masking ratios used in this work (90% images, 95% videos) enables much more efficient training compared to prior MAE works. This allows scaling up to larger models like ViT-Huge.

- This work shows that the simple vanilla Vision Transformer can work surprisingly well for both images and videos with proper pretraining. This is in contrast to other works like Swin Transformers and MViT that use specialized architectures for visual recognition tasks.

In summary, this work explores a new direction of unified self-supervised modeling of images and videos with a simple vanilla architecture and masking-based pretraining. The approach is simpler and more efficient than many prior works while achieving strong performance on both images and videos.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other pretraining objectives beyond masked autoencoding. The authors mention that pixel reconstruction with MAE may not learn good linearly separable features or similarity metrics. They suggest exploring other pretraining strategies like contrastive learning that could lead to better transfer performance. 

- Testing the approach on other modalities like 3D, audio, etc. The authors propose a simple and general framework that could potentially work across modalities, but they empirically validate it only on images and videos. Extending it to other modalities is an area for future work.

- Joint finetuning of the encoder on multiple datasets/tasks. The authors fine-tune the encoder separately on each downstream task, but suggest joint finetuning strategies could lead to better performance.

- Scaling up in terms of model size, datasets, and compute. The authors demonstrate strong performance by pretraining a unified ViT-Huge model, but suggest that training even larger models, on bigger datasets, and with more compute could further improve performance.

- Exploring architectural improvements like using a learnable masking scheme, integrating inductive biases, etc. The simple vanilla ViT architecture works well, but the authors suggest architectural improvements could be beneficial.

- Applying the approach to multimodal systems that handle text, speech, etc along with vision. The generality of the approach makes it suitable for extending to multi-modal systems.

So in summary, the main directions are exploring alternative pretraining objectives, scaling up the model/data/compute, testing on new modalities and tasks, and improving the model architecture. The overall goal is to build general unified models that work well across modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents OmniMAE, a single Vision Transformer model for learning visual representations on both images and videos using masked autoencoding. The authors show that by pretraining the vanilla ViT architecture with high levels of masking on a combination of image and video datasets, they can obtain a model that achieves strong performance on downstream tasks in both modalities. They are able to use extreme masking ratios of 90% on images and 95% on videos, leading to significant compute savings. The model is pretrained in a completely self-supervised manner without any human annotations. Experiments demonstrate that OmniMAE matches or exceeds the performance of prior work that trains specialized models separately on images or videos. The authors also analyze the effect of different masking strategies, decoder designs, and other factors on the model's ability to learn omnivorous representations. Overall, the work shows that masked autoencoding is an effective pretraining technique for obtaining a unified model that generalizes across visual modalities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents OmniMAE, a unified transformer model for images and videos that is pretrained using masked autoencoding. The model uses the standard Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with spatio-temporal patches as input. During pretraining, the model is trained to reconstruct randomly masked patches from the input images or videos using only the unmasked patches. The reconstruction is done using a lightweight decoder module. After pretraining, the decoder is discarded and the encoder can be finetuned on downstream tasks. 

The key results are: 1) OmniMAE performs competitively on both image and video recognition benchmarks compared to models specialized for each modality. 2) Joint pretraining on images and videos works better than pretraining on either modality alone. 3) Extremely high masking ratios of 90% for images and 95% for videos can be used, leading to significant compute savings during pretraining. 4) Simple techniques like sample replication during training improve efficiency without loss in accuracy. Overall, the work shows that a simple ViT model can be pretrained in an omnivorous fashion on multiple modalities using masked autoencoding, and achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. The unified modeling approach could enable future multimodal systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes OmniMAE, a single unified Vision Transformer model for both images and videos. OmniMAE uses the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and is trained with masked autoencoding on a combination of image data from ImageNet and video data from Something-Something-v2. The model takes as input spatio-temporal patches from images and videos. During training, a large proportion of the patches (90% for images, 95% for videos) are randomly masked out. The encoder processes only the unmasked patches while the decoder tries to reconstruct the original pixel values for all patches. By training the model to reconstruct the masked patches, it learns useful visual representations. After pretraining, the decoder is discarded and the encoder can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks. The simplicity of the architecture and training approach allows the single OmniMAE model to achieve strong performance on both image and video recognition benchmarks. The masking enables very efficient training since the model only processes a small fraction of patches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper addresses the problem of training a single unified model architecture that works well on both images and videos. Specifically, it aims to train a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) model on images and videos jointly using masked autoencoding as the pretraining task. The key questions and goals are:

- Can a simple ViT architecture be effectively applied to both images and videos without modifications? Prior work has used specialized Transformer architectures tailored for vision tasks.

- Can a single model achieve strong performance on both image and video recognition tasks? Prior work trains specialized models for each modality. 

- Can masked autoencoding serve as an effective pretraining strategy for a unified model? Other approaches use supervised pretraining objectives.

- Can extreme masking ratios like 90-95% be used to enable efficient training? Prior MAE work found performance dropped with >75% masking.

- How do design decisions like using a shared decoder, sample replication, etc. impact the unified training?

The main contribution is showing that the simple ViT can be trained with masked autoencoding on images and videos jointly to obtain a single high-performing model for both, outperforming specialized models and architectures.
