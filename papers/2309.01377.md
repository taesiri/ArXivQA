# [Memory augment is All You Need for image restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01377)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:Whether augmenting deep neural networks with a memory module and contrastive learning can improve performance on image restoration tasks like shadow removal, rain removal, and image deblurring. The authors propose a novel end-to-end network called MemoryNet that incorporates these two components:1) A memory augment module that models latent attribute variables to "remember" prototypical patterns and provide additional contextual information to aid in image restoration. 2) A contrastive learning framework that pushes representations of "positive" (clean/restored) image pairs together while pushing "negative" (degraded) pairs apart to help converge the model to generate more realistic outputs.The central hypothesis seems to be that by equipping networks with these memory and contrastive learning capacities, they can better handle various image degradation types and produce higher quality restored images compared to existing approaches. The experiments conducted across shadow removal, deraining, and deblurring datasets aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of MemoryNet and validate this central hypothesis.
