# [Memory augment is All You Need for image restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01377)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:Whether augmenting deep neural networks with a memory module and contrastive learning can improve performance on image restoration tasks like shadow removal, rain removal, and image deblurring. The authors propose a novel end-to-end network called MemoryNet that incorporates these two components:1) A memory augment module that models latent attribute variables to "remember" prototypical patterns and provide additional contextual information to aid in image restoration. 2) A contrastive learning framework that pushes representations of "positive" (clean/restored) image pairs together while pushing "negative" (degraded) pairs apart to help converge the model to generate more realistic outputs.The central hypothesis seems to be that by equipping networks with these memory and contrastive learning capacities, they can better handle various image degradation types and produce higher quality restored images compared to existing approaches. The experiments conducted across shadow removal, deraining, and deblurring datasets aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of MemoryNet and validate this central hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel end-to-end network called MemoryNet for image restoration, which can generate context-rich and spatially accurate outputs. 2. It designs a new memory augment layer that models a learnable latent attribute variable to remember prototypical patterns of representative structures globally.3. It conducts extensive experiments on three typical image restoration tasks - synthetic image de-shadowing, real image deraining, and image deblurring. The results show that the proposed MemoryNet achieves great performance while maintaining an attractive computational complexity. Detailed ablation studies, qualitative results and generalization tests are also provided.In summary, this paper proposes a memory-based network architecture for image restoration tasks. The key ideas are to use a memory augment module to capture global context and prototype patterns, and adopt a contrastive learning framework to regularize the feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The memory augment and contrastive learning modules are shown to improve performance over baseline methods.
