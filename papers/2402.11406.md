# [Don't Go To Extremes: Revealing the Excessive Sensitivity and   Calibration Limitations of LLMs in Implicit Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11406)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The fairness and trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is an important issue receiving increasing attention. Specifically, the ability of LLMs to detect implicit hate speech is not well understood.  
- Implicit hate speech uses indirect language to convey hateful intentions and is more difficult to detect than explicit hate speech.  
- The paper investigates: (1) whether LLMs exhibit exaggerated safety behaviors that incorrectly flag non-hate speech as hateful (2) the calibration of LLMs' confidence scores using different uncertainty estimation methods (3) the impact of different prompt formulations on LLM performance.

Methods:
- Evaluated 3 LLMs on implicit hate speech detection using 3 datasets: LLaMA-2-7b, Mixtral-8x7b, GPT-3.5-Turbo
- Assessed (1) classification performance using precision, recall and F1 (2) uncertainty calibration using AUC, ECE and Brier scores  
- Tested verbal, consistency and logit based confidence estimation methods
- Varied prompt patterns including QA, cloze, chain of thought, and target identification 

Key Findings:
- LLaMA-2 and Mixtral demonstrated over-sensitivity, mislabeling non-hate speech as hateful due to sensitivity to certain groups/topics
- All uncertainty methods showed poor calibration, with confidence scores clustered in narrow fixed ranges unchanged based on dataset complexity  
- Performance significantly relied on primary classification accuracy
- Different prompt patterns yielded varied performances but showed consistent trends for each model

Main Contributions:  
- Revealed over-sensitivity issue of LLMs in implicit hate speech detection causing potential fairness issues
- Showed limitations of current uncertainty estimation methods in assessing LLM confidence 
- Demonstrated impact of prompt engineering on model performance
- Underscored need for caution when optimizing LLMs to prevent veering toward extremes

The paper clearly frames the problem of implicit hate speech detection, provides extensive comparative analysis, and offers valuable insights into limitations of LLMs to support ongoing progress in fairness and accountability of language models.
