# [DS-Agent: Automated Data Science by Empowering Large Language Models   with Case-Based Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing large language model (LLM) agents struggle to achieve high success rates in automating data science tasks like building and training machine learning models. This is attributed to deficiencies in generating reasonable experiment plans and hallucination issues. Finetuning LLMs for this scenario requires collecting many samples and intensive computation. 

Solution - DS-Agent Framework
The paper proposes DS-Agent, a framework integrating LLM agents with case-based reasoning (CBR), to address these challenges through two stages:

1. Development Stage: 
- Leverages CBR to structure an iterative pipeline to retrieve relevant expert insights from Kaggle, reuse to plan experiments, execute code, evaluate feedback, and retain successful solutions.  
- Achieves consistent performance improvement through feedback-driven case revision.
- Eliminates expensive LLM finetuning by retaining successful cases.

2. Deployment Stage:
- Simplified CBR to adapt past successful solutions to new tasks, reducing demands on LLM capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Novel integration of LLMs and CBR for automated data science
- Development stage achieves 100% success rate across 12 tasks with GPT-4
- Deployment stage attains 36% average improvement in one pass rate over baselines
- Ranked 1st in performance while costing only $1.60 and $0.13 per run with GPT-4 in both stages 
- Significantly enhances capabilities of even open-source LLMs like Mixtral

The key innovation is augmenting LLMs with iterative case-based reasoning to effectively incorporate expert knowledge and task feedback for automated data science. By retaining good solutions instead of finetuning, DS-Agent flexibly improves over tasks while being highly efficient.
