# [Exploring language relations through syntactic distances and geographic   proximity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to quantitatively analyze the relationships and similarities between languages based on their syntax/grammar. Specifically, it seeks to compute linguistic distances between languages using their parts-of-speech (POS) sequences and explore if there is any correlation between the linguistic distances and geographical distances between languages. 

Proposed Solution:
1) Extract POS tagged sentences for 67 contemporary Eurasian languages from the Universal Dependencies corpus. 
2) Use an information-theoretic approach to determine that POS trigram distributions maximize capturing syntactic variations while being compatible with available data.
3) Calculate pairwise Jensen-Shannon distances between languages' POS trigram distributions to establish linguistic connections. Cluster languages based on distances.  
4) Assign geographic coordinates to each language and compute geographic distances. Correlate with linguistic distances.

Main Contributions:
- Showed POS trigram analysis optimally captures correlations in POS sequences of languages using predictability gain.
- Computed reliable linguistic distances between 67 languages based on POS trigram distributions using Jensen-Shannon divergence.
- Identified definite clusters corresponding to well-known language families. Explained exceptions due to distinct morphological typologies.  
- Discovered significant correlation between language similarity and geographic proximity, indicating influence of spatial closeness on language kinships.

Overall, the paper presents a novel quantitative framework to analyze relationships between languages using their syntactic similarities derived from POS sequences. Both the linguistic clustering and correlation of language/geographic distances provide valuable insights into understanding language connections.
