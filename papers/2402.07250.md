# [DIMON: Learning Solution Operators of Partial Differential Equations on   a Diffeomorphic Family of Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07250)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Learning solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) over varying initial/boundary conditions on multiple domains is important for many applications, but computationally expensive to solve from scratch each time. Existing neural operator methods for learning PDE solutions are limited to fixed domains. There lacks a framework to enable efficient learning of operators across a family of domains.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper introduces a novel framework called DIMON that combines diffeomorphic domain mapping with neural operators to learn approximate PDE solutions over a family of diffeomorphic domains. The key ideas are:

1) Map PDE problems on varying domains onto a fixed reference domain using diffeomorphisms. This transports solutions, domains, and boundary/initial conditions to the reference domain. 

2) Learn a latent parametrized PDE operator on the reference domain using a neural operator, with the diffeomorphism as a parameter. This maps boundary/initial conditions and reference domain coordinates to the solution.

3) Map predicted solutions on reference domain back to original domains via inverse diffeomorphism.

Main Contributions:

1) A general methodology to extend operator learning to a family of domains by combining diffeomorphisms and neural operators.

2) An extension of the universal approximation theorem for neural operators to the setting with diffeomorphic domains. This provides theoretical justification.

3) Demonstrated the framework on learning static and dynamic PDEs, including a cardiac model, over synthetic parametric shapes and real cardiac geometries. Showed accurate prediction and significant speedup over traditional PDE solvers.

4) The proposed idea is widely applicable for computational acceleration and optimization problems involving repeatedly solving PDEs over multiple domains in science and engineering.
