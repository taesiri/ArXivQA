# Unified Conversational Recommendation Policy Learning via Graph-based   Reinforcement Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to formulate and effectively solve the unified conversational recommendation policy learning (UCRPL) problem. Specifically, the paper points out that existing conversational recommendation methods mainly focus on solving one or two decision-making problems, such as what questions to ask, which items to recommend, or when to ask/recommend. However, solving these decision problems separately has limitations in scalability and generality. Thus, the key hypothesis is that formulating and solving the three decision problems in conversational recommendation (i.e., when, what, and which) as a unified policy learning task can lead to better performance and stability. The proposed method UNICORN aims to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the central research question is how to effectively integrate the three decision-making processes in conversational recommender systems into a unified policy learning framework for better performance and scalability. The UNICORN method based on dynamic graph neural networks is proposed to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper formulates the three separate decision-making processes in conversational recommender systems - when to ask/recommend, what to ask, and what to recommend - as a unified conversational recommendation policy learning (UCRPL) problem. 2. To address the challenges of UCRPL, the paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework called UNICORN (Unified Conversational Recommender) based on a dynamic weighted graph. UNICORN integrates graph-enhanced representation learning and sequential conversation modeling to capture user preferences.3. The paper designs two simple yet effective action selection strategies - preference-based item selection and weighted entropy-based attribute selection - to handle the large action space issue and improve sample efficiency in UCRPL.4. The paper conducts experiments on four public benchmark datasets and a real-world E-Commerce dataset. Results show UNICORN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for conversational recommendation in terms of success rate, efficiency, and a proposed hierarchical metric.5. The unified modeling of the recommendation and conversation components in UNICORN improves the scalability, stability, and generality of conversational recommender systems.In summary, the key innovation is formulating separate decision processes in conversational recommendation as a unified policy learning problem, and proposing a graph-based reinforcement learning framework along with action selection strategies to effectively address this problem. The unified modeling approach enhances the scalability, stability and performance of conversational recommender systems.
