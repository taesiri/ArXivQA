# [Concept Drift Adaptation in Text Stream Mining Settings: A Comprehensive   Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02901)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review on concept drift adaptation methods for text streams. Text streams pose unique challenges due to speed, volume, and concept drift. The authors reviewed 40 recent papers on handling concept drift in text streams based on the drift category, detection method, model update scheme, text representation method, and update mechanism. Key findings show that most methods address real drifts, use adaptive detection, update models incrementally, rely on bag-of-words/Word2Vec representations, and do not update representations. The review also catalogs evaluation metrics, applications, datasets, and visualization techniques used. Key limitations found include lack of benchmark datasets, standardized evaluation procedures, updatable text representations, and semantics-aware methods. The paper provides a taxonomy and analysis of the state-of-the-art that identifies critical open challenges for advancing concept drift adaptation research for text streams. Key future directions include developing better benchmark datasets, representation methods, evaluation procedures, and semantics-aware adaptive methods.
