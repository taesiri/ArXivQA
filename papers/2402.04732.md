# [Graph Cuts with Arbitrary Size Constraints Through Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Classical graph cut methods like minimum cut tend to produce unbalanced partitions with small isolated groups. 
- Normalized and ratio cuts address this by incorporating notions of size, but the constraints are not strict enough to guarantee perfect balance.
- These methods are also too restrictive for clustering imbalanced datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a new graph cut problem with arbitrary size constraints, enabling strict balance as well as custom imbalance ratios. 
- Constrain the cut to match given source and target distributions of cluster sizes, using optimal transport.
- Propose two variants: OT-ncut based on normalized cut, and OT-rcut based on ratio cut.
- Derive a nonconvex accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to optimize, with convergence guarantees.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel graph cut formulation using optimal transport for custom cluster size constraints. Applicable for both balanced and imbalanced cases.
- Efficient optimization algorithm with proven convergence. Results in sparse solutions.
- Comprehensive experiments showing superior performance over spectral clustering and other OT methods across datasets.
- Demonstrated ability to accurately recover desired cluster size distributions.
- Significant gains in efficiency compared to prior OT graph clustering techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces a highly flexible graph partitioning framework to obtain user-specified cluster sizes, with an efficient and provably convergent algorithm. Experiments validate improved clustering quality and computational efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new graph partitioning algorithm that can incorporate arbitrary size constraints on the resulting clusters through formulating the problem as an optimal transport problem and solving it efficiently with a proximal gradient method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Formulating a problem for obtaining graph cuts that are balanced for an arbitrarily defined notion of size instead of specifically the volume or cardinality as is traditionally done in spectral clustering. It also proposes a more general formulation of graph cuts with cluster size constraints through optimal transport. This can help with dealing with balanced and imbalanced graphs.

2. Proposing a new way to solve this constrained graph cut problem using a nonconvex accelerated proximal gradient scheme which has global convergence guarantees for specific step sizes. 

3. Comprehensive experiments on real-life graphs and graphs built from image datasets using subspace clustering. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of obtaining the desired cluster sizes, clustering performance and computational efficiency.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel graph cut algorithm based on optimal transport that can incorporate generic size constraints in a strict manner and solves the problem efficiently using an optimization algorithm with convergence guarantees. Experiments demonstrate its ability to produce graph partitions matching specified size constraints while also giving good clustering performance.

The paper proposes a new graph cut algorithm called "OT-cut" that can incorporate generic size constraints for graph partitioning. It formulates the problem as a regularized Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport problem and solves it using an accelerated proximal gradient descent algorithm. Experiments are done on graph datasets constructed from images using subspace clustering as well as some common graph datasets. The approach demonstrates good performance in terms of clustering accuracy and efficiency compared to spectral clustering baselines. The ability to recover graph partitions matching specified size constraints is also shown.
