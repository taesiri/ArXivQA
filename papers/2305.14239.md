# [On Learning to Summarize with Large Language Models as References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14239)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be:

Can smaller summarization models be trained to achieve performance on par with or superior to large language models (LLMs) when the LLMs are used as the reference or gold standard for the summarization task?

The authors investigate a new training paradigm where LLMs like GPT-3 are considered the reference for summarization instead of the original human-written reference summaries in datasets like CNN/DailyMail. To align with this paradigm shift, they explore methods like contrastive learning to leverage the LLMs for model training and evaluation. 

The main hypothesis appears to be that by treating the LLMs as the reference and using them to provide training signals (e.g. summary quality scores), smaller models can be trained to reach or surpass the performance of the reference LLMs themselves, even with a relatively small budget for accessing the LLMs.

So in summary, the key research question is whether smaller models can match large LM performance on summarization when trained in a paradigm that uses the LMs as the reference, which the paper aims to validate through proposed training and evaluation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new learning paradigm for text summarization models where large language models (LLMs) are treated as the reference or gold standard. The key ideas are:

- LLMs can provide a target probability distribution or quality measurement over all possible candidate summaries, instead of just a single reference summary. This enables training techniques like contrastive learning and reinforcement learning.

- The authors investigate two ways to leverage LLMs for evaluating summary quality - GPTScore which uses the LLM's predicted probability, and a new method GPTRank where the LLM ranks multiple candidate summaries. 

- A contrastive learning method called BRIO is used along with GPTScore or GPTRank to train smaller summarization models. This allows effectively utilizing the supervision signal from the LLM's quality scores.

- Experiments on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that smaller models trained this way can achieve performance on par with or better than the reference LLM, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. 

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and empirically validating a new training paradigm that treats LLMs as references for summarization, by leveraging contrastive learning and LLM-based evaluation methods like GPTScore and GPTRank.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates a new learning paradigm for text summarization models where large language models like GPT-3 are considered the reference or gold standard oracle, and proposes a novel training method based on contrastive learning with the LLM as the summary quality evaluator, demonstrating that smaller models trained this way can match or exceed the LLM performance when evaluated by the LLM itself.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in text summarization:

- It explores a new training paradigm where large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are treated as the reference or gold standard for summarization, rather than using the reference summaries in existing datasets like CNN/DailyMail. This is a shift from most prior work which trains and evaluates on standard datasets with reference summaries. 

- The paper proposes methods to leverage LLMs for both training and evaluating summarization models, via approaches like contrastive learning and LLM-based evaluation metrics like GPTScore and the introduced GPTRank. This allows smaller models to be trained to match LLM performance. Most prior work does not exploit LLMs in this integrated way.

- Experiments show that smaller models like BART can match or exceed the performance of LLMs like GPT-3 on summarization when trained on LLM-generated summaries and evaluated by LLM metrics. This demonstrates the viability of the proposed training paradigm.

- The approach aims to address issues pointed out by recent studies showing LLM-generated summaries are often preferred to reference summaries in datasets. It provides a way to improve on deficiencies of reference datasets.

- The work focuses on a low-resource, efficient LLM training regime, unlike large-scale LLM pretraining. This could make adoption more practical.

Overall, the key novelty is in proposing and demonstrating an end-to-end paradigm shift to leverage LLMs for all stages of training and evaluation in summarization. The paper shows initial promise for this approach addressing limitations of current standard practices.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Further exploring the paradigm of using LLMs as references/gold standards for training and evaluating summarization models, including testing on more datasets and with more types of models. The authors suggest this paradigm could help provide a balance between model performance and computational cost.

- Investigating other training methods beyond contrastive learning that can leverage the supervision signals provided by LLMs, such as reinforcement learning techniques.

- Exploring different ways to effectively and efficiently query LLMs for training and evaluation, such as through ranking tasks or text infilling.

- Applying this paradigm of using LLMs as references to other natural language generation tasks beyond summarization.

- Comparing different choices of LLMs as references and studying the impact on model training.

- Developing improved methods of generating high-quality reference summaries from LLMs to better align with human preferences.

- Further analyzing the differences between LLM-based evaluation methods like GPTScore and GPTRank and their effectiveness for training.

- Studying whether models trained in this paradigm can surpass LLMs on human evaluations and how well they generalize.

In summary, the main directions are developing this LLM-as-reference paradigm further, applying it to other tasks, comparing different training techniques with it, analyzing different LLMs and evaluation methods, and evaluating the trained models thoroughly.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates a new learning paradigm for text summarization models where large language models (LLMs) are considered as the reference or gold standard for the task. Recent studies have found LLMs can generate higher quality summaries compared to reference summaries in existing datasets like CNN/DailyMail. To align with this paradigm shift, the authors propose contrastive learning methods that leverage LLM-based evaluation, namely GPTScore and a newly proposed method GPTRank, to provide supervision signals for training smaller summarization models. The contrastive learning methods require the model to assign higher probabilities to candidate summaries preferred by the LLM evaluators. Experiments on CNN/DailyMail show that smaller models trained this way can achieve performance on par with or better than the reference LLMs themselves when evaluated by the LLMs. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving model performance over standard maximum likelihood estimation training, while requiring only a small budget to access the LLMs. The training scripts, outputs, and LLM evaluation results are released to facilitate future research.

In summary, the key ideas are: 1) LLMs are considered as references for summarization instead of original dataset reference summaries; 2) Contrastive learning methods are used to train smaller models to align with LLM preferences, by leveraging LLM-based evaluation like GPTScore and proposed GPTRank; 3) Experiments demonstrate trained smaller models can match or exceed reference LLM performance under LLM-based evaluation, showing promise for this new learning paradigm. The resources are released to enable further research.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new learning paradigm for text summarization models where large language models (LLMs) are treated as the reference or gold standard for the task. To align with this paradigm shift, the authors investigate using LLMs to provide supervision signals for training smaller summarization models. Specifically, they explore two methods of leveraging LLMs for evaluating summary quality - GPTScore which uses the LLM-predicted probability as the quality score, and GPTRank where the LLM ranks multiple candidate summaries. Based on these LLM evaluation methods, the authors adopt a contrastive learning approach called BRIO to train the smaller summarization models. BRIO requires the model to assign a higher probability to a summary candidate that receives a better score from the LLM evaluator. Experiments on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that smaller models trained this way can match or exceed the performance of the reference LLMs themselves, demonstrating the efficacy of this new training paradigm. The main novelty is using LLMs as references for both training and evaluating summarization models.

 The paper is addressing the issue of large language models (LLMs) generating better summaries than the reference summaries in commonly used summarization datasets. Specifically, it investigates a new learning paradigm for text summarization models where the LLMs are considered the reference or gold standard for the task. 

The key questions/problems the paper explores are:

- How to align the training and evaluation of summarization models to the paradigm shift of using LLMs as references instead of traditional reference summaries. 

- Examining standard practices like training algorithms and evaluation methods that are suitable for the LLM-as-reference setting.

- Investigating methods to leverage LLMs for summary quality evaluation, such as using the LLM's predicted probabilities or rankings of candidate summaries.
