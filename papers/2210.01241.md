# Is Reinforcement Learning (Not) for Natural Language Processing:   Benchmarks, Baselines, and Building Blocks for Natural Language Policy   Optimization

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it appears the central research question is: Is reinforcement learning (RL) a practical and effective paradigm for training natural language processing (NLP) models, specifically large language models (LMs), to align with human preferences?The authors note that using RL for LM-based generation faces challenges like training instability and lack of customized benchmarks/libraries. So they seem to be investigating whether RL can overcome these challenges and effectively optimize LMs according to human preferences, compared to other approaches like supervised learning.To address this question, the paper introduces:- An open-source library RL4LMs for optimizing LMs with RL- A benchmark called GRUE (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) for evaluating RL-trained LMs- An RL algorithm called NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization) designed to improve training stability Through experiments on GRUE, they compare RL (with/without supervised pre-training) to supervised learning alone. They also evaluate different RL algorithms, including NLPO vs PPO. The goal is to determine if and when RL is preferable to supervised learning for aligning LMs to human preferences.In summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that RL can be an effective practical approach for LM preference alignment despite prior challenges, especially with proper benchmarks/algorithms like they propose. The experiments aim to validate whether this hypothesis holds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be introducing:1. An open-source modular library called \framework{} for optimizing language generators with reinforcement learning. The library allows training encoder and encoder-decoder language models from HuggingFace with customizable environments, reward functions, metrics, and RL algorithms.2. A benchmark called \benchmark{} (GRUE) with 6 language generation tasks that are trained with reward functions instead of target strings. This is aimed at evaluating RL algorithms for NLP tasks.3. An RL algorithm called NLPO that dynamically learns to mask out less relevant tokens during language generation to reduce the combinatorial action space. The key results seem to be:- RL techniques are generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences, especially when combined with supervised pre-training. - The proposed NLPO algorithm exhibits greater stability and performance compared to prior policy gradient methods like PPO, in both automatic metrics and human evaluations.- Learned reward functions enable greater performance gains when used for RL training compared to collecting more expert demonstrations for supervised training.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be providing tools and benchmarks to facilitate research into aligning LMs with human preferences via RL, and showing the promise of the proposed NLPO algorithm.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of aligning language models with human preferences using reinforcement learning:- It introduces a new open-source modular library called RL4LMs for optimizing language generators with RL. This provides researchers with a standard set of tools and algorithms to work with, building on popular libraries like HuggingFace and Stable Baselines. Other work has not focused as much on releasing reusable code/libraries.- It proposes a new benchmark called GRUE (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) consisting of 7 NLG tasks paired with reward functions rather than supervised labels. This allows standardized comparisons between different RL algorithms on alignment. Prior work has tended to use proprietary datasets. - It introduces a novel RL algorithm called NLPO that learns to mask less relevant actions. This aims to address stability issues in prior policy gradient algorithms like PPO when action spaces are very large like in text generation. Most prior work has focused more on algorithmic tricks like KL penalties.- It conducts extensive experiments comparing various algorithms on GRUE using both automated metrics and human evaluations. Many prior works have focused on 1-2 tasks with less thorough evaluation. - It provides practical insights into implementation details like the effects of different decoding methods and discount factors. A lot of prior applied RL research for NLP has not delved as much into these lower-level details.So in summary, this paper pushes forward the field by releasing new resources (library, benchmark, algorithm) and conducting large-scale experiments and ablations to gain insights. The level of code release and reproducible comparisons on standardized tasks are a key advance.
