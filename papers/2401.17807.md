# [Advances in 3D Generation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17807)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Advances in 3D Generation: A Survey":

Problem:
The paper addresses the growing need for automated 3D content generation to support applications like video games, movies, VR/AR experiences etc. Manual 3D modeling is expensive and time-consuming. While 2D image generation has seen great progress with neural representations and generative models, extending these techniques to generate high-quality and diverse 3D models is non-trivial and faces unique challenges.

Solution: 
The paper provides a comprehensive survey and a structured overview of the field of 3D generation. It introduces various 3D scene representations which serve as backbones, categorized into explicit (point clouds, meshes etc.), implicit (radiance fields, signed distance functions) and hybrid representations. It then explores a diverse range of 3D generation methods based on algorithmic paradigms - feedforward generation, optimization-based generation, procedural generation and generative novel view synthesis. Feedforward methods directly produce 3D representations using models like GANs, VAEs, diffusion models etc. Optimization methods leverage pretrained networks to optimize 3D models from user inputs. Procedural methods follow predefined rules to generate models. Novel view synthesis focuses on generating multi-view images rather than explicit 3D. The paper also compiles key 3D datasets and outlines applications like face, human and scene generation.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of neural 3D scene representations that serve as backbones
- Structured categorization of rapidly evolving 3D generation literature based on algorithmic approaches 
- Evolutionary tree depicting branches of generation methods and their progress over years
- Review of 3D datasets and major application domains
- Discussion of open challenges around evaluation, datasets, representations and control

The paper delivers a holistic overview of recent advances in 3D generation to help readers rapidly understand key methodologies, frameworks, datasets and applications. It identifies open problems to inspire further research towards creating high-quality and diverse 3D content at scale.
