# [TGPT-PINN: Nonlinear model reduction with transformed GPT-PINNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional linear model order reduction techniques often fail for transport-dominated PDE problems due to the slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width. This leads to the need to develop nonlinear model order reduction strategies.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces the Transformed Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (TGPT-PINN) to accomplish nonlinear model reduction for transport-dominated PDEs within a physics-informed neural network framework. The key ideas are:

1) Build upon the Generative Pre-Trained PINNs (GPT-PINN) which is a meta-learning approach that trains a network-of-networks to capture parametric dependence. This allows computational savings compared to training individual PINNs.

2) Introduce a novel transform layer in the GPT-PINN that applies a parametric spatial and temporal transform to map between different parametric solutions. This transform layer enables resolution of parameter-dependent discontinuities.

3) Incorporate a shock-capturing loss function component to enhance discontinuity resolution.

4) The offline stage trains individual PINN solutions and the GPT-PINN, while the efficient online stage trains the transform layer and GPT-PINN coefficients for any new parameter value.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first approach to integrate ideas from nonlinear model reduction into the PINNs framework in a completely non-intrusive manner, requiring only the PDE residual.

- Introduces transform layers into PINN-based meta-learning to boost expressiveness and enable discontinuity resolution with very few neuronal degrees of freedom.

- Demonstrates that the TGPT-PINN can effectively tackle model reduction for problems with parameter-dependent discontinuities, where traditional linear techniques fail. 

- Shows numerically that nonlinear effects can be captured with good accuracy using only a single transform layer and a handful of neurons in the GPT-PINN.

In summary, the paper makes important advances at the intersection of physics-informed machine learning and nonlinear reduced order modeling through the design of the TGPT-PINN architecture. The transform layer specifically counteracts limitations of linear reduction for transport-dominated regimes.
