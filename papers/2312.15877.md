# [PBCounter: Weighted Model Counting on Pseudo-Boolean Formulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Weighted model counting (WMC) is an important reasoning task with many applications like probabilistic inference. 
- Existing WMC solvers work on conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas. However, CNF is not a natural representation for humans in many applications. 
- Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints are more expressive and succinct than CNF. But there are no existing tools for directly performing WMC on PB constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the first tool PBCounter for performing lazy WMC directly on PB constraints. 
- It extends the ADDMC algorithmic framework to construct algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to represent PB constraints and perform product and projection operations.
- Two preprocessing techniques are proposed - using backbone literals and removing redundant constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Implementation of the first weighted model counter PBCounter that works directly on PB constraints.
- Algorithms to construct ADDs for PB constraints with = and â‰¥ operators and perform WMC using dynamic programming.
- Two preprocessing techniques tailored for WMC on PB constraints.
- Extensive experiments showing PBCounter solves more instances and faster than state-of-the-art WMC solvers on CNF formulas encoded from PB constraints. PBCounter uniquely solves 110 benchmarks.
- Demonstrates the advantage of direct WMC on PB constraints compared to encoding them into CNF formulas.

In summary, the paper addresses the lack of WMC tools for PB constraints by proposing PBCounter which shows superior performance. The main novelty is in constructing ADDs for PB constraints and applying preprocessing specifically for this task.
