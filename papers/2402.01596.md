# [Immersive Video Compression using Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Immersive videos such as VR/AR videos have very high data rates and require efficient compression methods for storage and transmission. 
- Existing video codecs are not designed to exploit inter-view redundancy that exists in multi-view immersive videos.
- Recent implicit neural representation (INR) based video codecs have shown promise for conventional video compression, but their application to immersive videos has not been explored.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MV-HiNeRV, an INR based codec tailored for multi-view immersive video compression. 
- It extends the HiNeRV codec by learning separate feature grids for each view while sharing network parameters across views. This allows exploiting inter-view redundancy.
- Additional techniques like weight quantization and entropy regularization are used to improve compression efficiency.

Contributions:
- First INR based codec designed specifically for multi-view immersive video compression.
- Significantly outperforms MPEG Test Model for immersive video compression with average 46.92% bit rate savings on standard test sequences.
- Up to 72.33% savings compared to anchor.
- Demonstrates great promise of INR models for immersive video use cases.
- Analysis and results on compression performance as well as visual quality assessment provided.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel INR based immersive video codec that exploits inter-view redundancy and demonstrates state-of-the-art coding efficiency on standard test data. The results showcase the potential of implicit neural representations for compressing emerging immersive video formats.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MV-HiNeRV, an implicit neural representation (INR)-based codec for multi-view video compression that extends the HiNeRV codec by learning separate feature grids for each view while sharing network parameters, achieving significant bitrate savings over the MPEG Immersive Video Test Model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MV-HiNeRV, an implicit neural representation (INR)-based codec for multi-view video compression. Specifically, the paper:

- Extends the application of INR-based video codecs from single-view to multi-view video coding, for the first time. 

- Proposes MV-HiNeRV, which modifies the existing HiNeRV codec by learning separate feature grids for each view while sharing network parameters across views. This allows exploiting inter-view redundancy in addition to spatial and temporal redundancy.

- Evaluates MV-HiNeRV on MPEG multi-view test sequences and shows significant coding gains (46.92% on average) over the MIV Test Model, demonstrating the potential of INR-based approaches for immersive video compression.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the first INR-based multi-view video codec, MV-HiNeRV, which effectively exploits inter-view redundancy and advances the state-of-the-art in immersive video compression.
