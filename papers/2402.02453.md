# [AI Art Neural Constellation: Revealing the Collective and Contrastive   State of AI-Generated and Human Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02453)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis to position AI-generated art within the context of human art heritage. The goal is to understand how AI art differs from human-made art using various analytical dimensions: 

\textbf{Problem:} With the emergence of generative AI models for art creation, there are controversial discussions regarding authorship, creativity, etc. It is important to study AI art more systematically to promote better understanding as a new artistic medium. 

\textbf{Approach:} The paper collects a large dataset "ArtConstellation" of 6,000 human artworks (WikiArt) and 3,200 AI-generated pieces from various state-of-the-art models like StyleGAN, CAN, CWAN, VQ-GAN and DDPM. These artworks are analyzed across five aspects:

1. \textbf{Wölfflin's art principles} (5 pairs of opposing concepts like linearly vs. painterly)
2. \textbf{General art principles} (15 concepts like geometric, abstract, planar etc.) 
3. \textbf{Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) analysis} in CLIP space
4. Closest \textbf{time period} of human art using style classifiers
5. User study for \textbf{emotions} and \textbf{likability}

\textbf{Findings:} Key results from the multi-dimensional analysis:

- AI art is more related to Wölfflin's Baroque style concepts 
- AI art centers are closer to modern period human art (1800-2000) based on general principles
- Landscapes and geometric abstract AI art is In-Distribution; deformed figures are Out-Of-Distribution
- 70\% closest human art is from 1850-2000 period
- Higher likability when AI art depicts familiar subjects like landscape
- AI art evokes diverse emotions like human art

\textbf{Conclusion:} The analysis reveals AI art's unique visual features like reduced figuration, relation to modern styles, etc. The proposed framework of datasets and methodology serves as a valuable starting point to contrast human and AI art.

The key contribution is the comprehensive analytical protocol to position and characterize AI-generated art effectively within human art contexts using both computational evaluations and human studies.
