# [Electronic properties, correlated topology and Green's function zeros](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main points of this paper appear to be:1. There has been growing interest recently in understanding electronic topology in correlated systems, where the Green's function can develop zeros in addition to poles. However, it has been unclear whether and how these zeros actually contribute to physical properties. 2. This paper aims to address this question by analyzing an exactly solvable model for a Mott insulator, where contour zeros emerge in the Green's function within the Mott gap. 3. The authors compute the total charge and Hall conductivity response functions in this model. They argue that the zeros contribute to these measurable quantities in a way that is consistent with general expectations - i.e. the observables remain insensitive to chemical potential variations within the Mott gap.4. This is achieved through the zeros contributing to topological quantities like the Luttinger volume or winding number, but these are offset by non-topological "backflow" terms to keep the total observable invariant.  5. The authors suggest their analysis provides a framework to understand how Green's function zeros can contribute to topological response functions in strongly correlated systems where quasiparticles are not well-defined.In summary, the key hypothesis is that Green's function zeros can contribute to measurable quantities in interacting topological systems in a consistent way, which the authors demonstrate using an exactly solvable model. The overall aim is to advance understanding of topology and correlations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some of the main contributions are:- The paper studies the role of Green's function zeros in correlated electronic topology. Green's function zeros are features that can emerge in strongly correlated systems, where quasiparticle excitations break down. - The paper shows that the Green's function zeros contribute to several physically measurable correlation functions, including the total particle number and Hall conductivity. - The contributions from the zeros are shown to be consistent with general physical expectations. For example, the measurable quantities remain robust against chemical potential variations within the Mott gap, even though the zeros themselves shift with chemical potential changes.- The results are demonstrated on an exactly solvable model for a Mott insulator. This provides an unambiguous example where the role of zeros can be analyzed.- The authors argue their work helps advance the understanding of the interplay between topology, symmetry and strong correlations in quantum materials, where quasiparticle excitations may not be well-defined.In summary, the key contribution is using an exact model to demonstrate how Green's function zeros can consistently contribute to topological properties of interacting systems, despite the breakdown of quasiparticles. The results help develop an understanding of topology in strongly correlated settings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on correlated topology and Green's function zeros:- It addresses a fundamental question about whether and how Green's function zeros contribute to measurable electronic properties like charge density and conductivity. Previous works have mostly focused on the theoretical aspects of zeros in interacting systems, but their relationship to observables has been unclear. - The paper uses an exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model to demonstrate explicitly how zeros contribute to charge and Hall conductivity while preserving expected physical behavior like robustness to chemical potential shifts. This provides concrete evidence for the role of zeros, going beyond more abstract arguments.- It reconciles the notions that zeros affect topological properties but observables should be insensitive to chemical potential changes within the Mott gap. The key insight is that zeros contribute to topological quantities like the Luttinger count or Hall conductivity, but their effect is canceled by a "backflow" term to ensure overall robustness.- The analysis employs formal arguments based on Green's functions, spectral decomposition, and Ward identities. This level of rigor in an exactly solvable model strengthens the theoretical foundation for the role of zeros.- The paper mostly focuses on conceptual issues and an idealized model. An open question is how the conclusions extend to real materials and experimental observables. But it provides an important step toward addressing zeros in real systems.Overall, this work makes advances in establishing the contribution of Green's function zeros to observable properties in interacting topological systems. The combination of formal theory and exactly solvable modeling helps place discussions about zeros on firmer ground compared to previous works. It points the way toward further efforts to probe zeros experimentally and extend the theory to real materials.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further exploring the interplay between symmetry, topology and strong correlations. The authors state their work helps advance understanding of this interplay, but there is more to be done. They suggest their exact solvable model could be a starting point for further analysis.- Developing more nuanced experimental probes to detect Green's function zeros. The authors discuss the challenges in directly probing zeros, and suggest looking at indirect signatures like Curie-like magnetic susceptibility. More indirect probes could be developed. - Deriving explicit forms for the higher-point correlation functions alluded to in the conductivity formula. The authors did not fully derive these terms, which contribute to the deviation from the topological invariant. Doing so could provide further insights.- Applying the conceptual framework to study other topological response functions in interacting systems without well-defined quasiparticles. The authors suggest their work offers a general framework applicable beyond this specific model system.- Considering processes that connect non-degenerate ground states to excited states to yield zeros at zero temperature. The authors mention this mechanism briefly but do not explore it in depth.- Benchmarking against other solvable models such as the atomic limit of the Hubbard model. The authors do this to some extent but more comparisons could be made.In summary, the authors point to further exploring the theory they have developed, deriving more complete expressions, applying the ideas more broadly, and developing better experimental probes as areas for future work. Their model provides a foundation for advancing the understanding of topology and correlations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper studies the role of Green's function zeros in strongly correlated electronic systems. It focuses on an exactly solvable model of a Mott insulator where contours of Green's function zeros develop within the insulating gap. The authors show that these zeros contribute to physical properties like the total particle number and Hall conductivity, but in a way that is consistent with general expectations - namely the observables remain insensitive to chemical potential variations within the Mott gap. The particle number contains contributions from both the Luttinger volume and a "backflow" term coming from the zeros. Similarly, the Hall response contains a quantized topological term proportional to the 3D winding number as well as a non-quantized backflow term. The two terms in each case combine to keep the total quantity robust against chemical potential changes. The results provide a framework to understand how Green's function zeros can affect measurable properties while avoiding inconsistencies, which is important for studying topological responses in strongly correlated systems without well-defined quasiparticles.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper investigates the role of Green's function zeros and their relationship to physical observables in strongly correlated systems. The authors consider an exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model which exhibits a metal to Mott insulator transition. In the Mott insulating state, the Green's function develops zeros along certain frequency-momentum contours within the gap. The authors first show that these zeros contribute to the total particle number through the Luttinger count and its deviation. The zeros allow the particle number to remain invariant to chemical potential changes within the Mott gap. Next, the authors compute the Hall conductivity starting from non-interacting Chern bands. They find two contributions - a quantized term proportional to the 3D winding number containing zeros, and a non-quantized backflow term. The two terms combine to make the Hall conductivity robust to chemical potential variations up to the Mott gap, reconciling the notion of zeros contributing to observables while keeping them invariant. Overall, this work demonstrates how Green's function zeros affect measurable correlation functions in interacting topological systems, consistent with physical expectations. The results provide a basis for further exploring the interplay of topology, symmetry and correlations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper develops a theoretical framework to understand the role of Green's function zeros in contributing to observable physical properties in strongly correlated systems. The key methods used are:1) The paper utilizes an exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model to serve as a prototypical example of a Mott insulator where Green's function zeros occur within the Mott gap. 2) General formulas are derived relating the total particle number and Hall conductivity to both the poles and zeros of the Green's function. This shows that zeros contribute to topological quantities like the Luttinger volume and winding number, while additional non-topological "backflow" terms are needed to preserve physical properties like total charge.3) Concrete calculations of the particle number and Hall conductivity are performed for the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, explicitly demonstrating how the zeros contribute to observables in a way that maintains invariance to chemical potential changes within the Mott gap. 4) The analysis utilizes properties of the Green's function like analyticity and symmetry constraints to facilitate calculations. The Ward identities connect current-current correlation functions to topological properties represented through the Green's function.In summary, the key method is using an exactly solvable correlated model to derive relationships between Green's function zeros and measurable quantities, in a way that resolves long-standing questions about the role of zeros in interacting systems. The calculations demonstrate consistency with physical expectations and provide insights into correlated topological systems.
