# [Electronic properties, correlated topology and Green's function zeros](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract and introduction, the main points of this paper appear to be:1. There has been growing interest recently in understanding electronic topology in correlated systems, where the Green's function can develop zeros in addition to poles. However, it has been unclear whether and how these zeros actually contribute to physical properties. 2. This paper aims to address this question by analyzing an exactly solvable model for a Mott insulator, where contour zeros emerge in the Green's function within the Mott gap. 3. The authors compute the total charge and Hall conductivity response functions in this model. They argue that the zeros contribute to these measurable quantities in a way that is consistent with general expectations - i.e. the observables remain insensitive to chemical potential variations within the Mott gap.4. This is achieved through the zeros contributing to topological quantities like the Luttinger volume or winding number, but these are offset by non-topological "backflow" terms to keep the total observable invariant.  5. The authors suggest their analysis provides a framework to understand how Green's function zeros can contribute to topological response functions in strongly correlated systems where quasiparticles are not well-defined.In summary, the key hypothesis is that Green's function zeros can contribute to measurable quantities in interacting topological systems in a consistent way, which the authors demonstrate using an exactly solvable model. The overall aim is to advance understanding of topology and correlations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some of the main contributions are:- The paper studies the role of Green's function zeros in correlated electronic topology. Green's function zeros are features that can emerge in strongly correlated systems, where quasiparticle excitations break down. - The paper shows that the Green's function zeros contribute to several physically measurable correlation functions, including the total particle number and Hall conductivity. - The contributions from the zeros are shown to be consistent with general physical expectations. For example, the measurable quantities remain robust against chemical potential variations within the Mott gap, even though the zeros themselves shift with chemical potential changes.- The results are demonstrated on an exactly solvable model for a Mott insulator. This provides an unambiguous example where the role of zeros can be analyzed.- The authors argue their work helps advance the understanding of the interplay between topology, symmetry and strong correlations in quantum materials, where quasiparticle excitations may not be well-defined.In summary, the key contribution is using an exact model to demonstrate how Green's function zeros can consistently contribute to topological properties of interacting systems, despite the breakdown of quasiparticles. The results help develop an understanding of topology in strongly correlated settings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on correlated topology and Green's function zeros:- It addresses a fundamental question about whether and how Green's function zeros contribute to measurable electronic properties like charge density and conductivity. Previous works have mostly focused on the theoretical aspects of zeros in interacting systems, but their relationship to observables has been unclear. - The paper uses an exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model to demonstrate explicitly how zeros contribute to charge and Hall conductivity while preserving expected physical behavior like robustness to chemical potential shifts. This provides concrete evidence for the role of zeros, going beyond more abstract arguments.- It reconciles the notions that zeros affect topological properties but observables should be insensitive to chemical potential changes within the Mott gap. The key insight is that zeros contribute to topological quantities like the Luttinger count or Hall conductivity, but their effect is canceled by a "backflow" term to ensure overall robustness.- The analysis employs formal arguments based on Green's functions, spectral decomposition, and Ward identities. This level of rigor in an exactly solvable model strengthens the theoretical foundation for the role of zeros.- The paper mostly focuses on conceptual issues and an idealized model. An open question is how the conclusions extend to real materials and experimental observables. But it provides an important step toward addressing zeros in real systems.Overall, this work makes advances in establishing the contribution of Green's function zeros to observable properties in interacting topological systems. The combination of formal theory and exactly solvable modeling helps place discussions about zeros on firmer ground compared to previous works. It points the way toward further efforts to probe zeros experimentally and extend the theory to real materials.
