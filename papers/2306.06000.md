# [S$^{3}$: Increasing GPU Utilization during Generative Inference for   Higher Throughput](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06000)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we increase GPU utilization and throughput when serving transformer-based generative AI models by predicting the output sequence length?

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question are:

- Proposing a framework called S3 that predicts the output sequence length for a given input text prompt using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model. 

- Using the predicted sequence length to intelligently allocate memory and schedule model inference requests to maximize GPU utilization.

- Handling mispredictions through a supervisor module that monitors memory usage and adjusts on the fly.

- Demonstrating up to 6.49x higher throughput compared to prior serving systems that do not predict output length.

So in summary, the paper focuses on overcoming the GPU memory bottleneck in serving large transformer models by predicting output lengths and using this to optimize memory allocation and scheduling. This allows higher GPU utilization and throughput. The central hypothesis is that predicting output length can enable more efficient resource usage during inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a system called S3 (Scheduling Sequences with Speculation) to improve GPU utilization and achieve higher throughput when serving large language models for text generation. The key ideas are:

- Using a predictor to estimate the output sequence length for a given input. This allows allocating just enough memory for each sequence instead of over-provisioning.

- Scheduling sequences based on the predicted lengths to maximize GPU utilization and batch size. This increases throughput. 

- Handling prediction errors gracefully by preempting sequences that exceed allocated memory and retraining the predictor.

- Expanding the latency-throughput tradeoff frontier by trading off some latency for significant throughput gains in text generation scenarios.

In summary, by predicting output lengths and tailoring resource allocation per sequence, S3 is able to pack more sequences into each batch and improve GPU utilization. This results in 1.13-6.49x higher throughput compared to prior serving systems like ORCA and FasterTransformer. The paper demonstrates these benefits on various model sizes from 6B to 175B parameters.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a system called S3 that improves the throughput of deploying large language models for text generation on GPUs. It does this by predicting the output sequence length, scheduling requests accordingly to increase GPU utilization, and handling prediction errors.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper on increasing GPU utilization during generative inference introduces a novel system called S3 that leverages predicting output sequence length to maximize throughput when serving large language models. It makes several notable contributions compared to prior work:

- Most existing systems for serving large language models either sacrifice latency for memory usage (e.g. HuggingFace Transformers) or sacrifice memory and throughput for lower latency (e.g. NVIDIA FasterTransformer). S3 strikes a balance by predicting output length to optimize memory allocation while also batching strategically for high throughput.

- S3 is the first system to incorporate output length prediction into the serving pipeline to tailor memory allocation and scheduling. This allows handling variable sequence lengths efficiently compared to allocating max sequence length memory uniformly.

- The paper thoroughly analyzes the penalties for mispredictions and shows the throughput benefits are far greater, up to 6.49x compared to prior systems in experiments. This demonstrates the value of speculative scheduling based on predicted sequence length.

- S3 also contributes a new technique to handle mispredictions by retraining the predictor model and preempting/rescheduling errant sequences. This allows the system to gracefully recover when predictions are inaccurate.

- The paper evaluates S3 on a range of model sizes from 6B to 175B parameters, analyzing both maximum throughput and throughput under latency constraints. This shows the benefits generalize across model scale.

Overall, S3 makes important research contributions in using sequence length prediction to optimize scheduling and memory management during deployment of large language models. The techniques seem promising for balancing latency, throughput and efficient resource usage. The paper provides thorough analysis and evaluation compared to state-of-the-art systems like ORCA and FasterTransformer.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Evaluate \name on actual production workloads and traces from commercial text generation services. The authors currently make assumptions about request distributions since there are no public traces. Analyzing real-world traces could help further optimize and deploy \name. 

- Standardize latency SLO constraints for text generation tasks. Currently there are no widely adopted latency targets like in other ML workloads. Defining latency goals for different text generation applications would allow broader evaluation of \name across use cases.

- Extend \name to model parallel and tensor parallel scenarios when serving very large models. The paper currently evaluates up to 175B parameter models on one GPU, but even larger models may require model parallelism.

- Explore combining \name with complementary techniques like model compression, quantization, and sparsity to further reduce misprediction penalties. These could allow using a lighter but potentially less accurate predictor.

- Analyze the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs with different predictor model sizes and complexities. Larger predictors may be more accurate but also incur more overhead.

- Study the interactions between predictor accuracy, scheduling policy, and resulting throughput/latency trade-offs. 

- Evaluate \name on other autoregressive generative tasks beyond text, such as image generation, audio synthesis, etc.

In summary, the authors suggest further evaluation on real-world workloads, generalization to extremely large models, integration with model compression techniques, and extensive sensitivity studies to productionize and extend \name. Evaluating it on diverse generative tasks is also suggested.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes S3, a system to improve GPU utilization and throughput when serving large language models for text generation. The key innovation is predicting the output sequence length for each input query, and allocating GPU memory accordingly instead of assuming worst-case sequence length. This allows packing more sequences into each batch, increasing GPU utilization. Specifically, S3 has three components - a predictor to estimate output sequence length, a scheduler to batch sequences based on the predictions, and a supervisor to monitor and handle any mispredictions. By removing redundant memory allocation, S3 achieves up to 6.49x higher throughput compared to prior systems, and similar throughput to a perfect-prediction oracle system. The results demonstrate significant throughput gains are possible by simply predicting output lengths for text generation instead of assuming worst-case. Overall, S3 offers a practical system-algorithm co-design to boost throughput of deployed large language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a system called S3 (Scheduling Sequences with Speculation) to improve the throughput of serving large language models (LLMs) for text generation on GPUs. LLMs have massive memory requirements, particularly due to the key/value cache that stores previous token information. Current systems either frequently allocate memory like HuggingFace Transformers leading to overhead, or preallocate maximum memory like NVIDIA's FasterTransformers leading to underutilization. S3 addresses this via a sequence length predictor to estimate output lengths, a scheduler to batch sequences based on predictions for maximum GPU utilization, and a supervisor to handle mispredictions. 

S3 achieves higher throughput by more efficiently using GPU memory and computation. Evaluations show S3 achieves up to 6.49x higher throughput in offline scenarios and generates up to 6.49x more sequences under latency constraints in online scenarios versus prior systems. The scheduling and speculation in S3 provide more options in the latency-throughput tradeoff. Furthermore, S3 provides similar throughput to vanilla systems but with fewer GPUs, thereby improving cost-efficiency. In summary, S3 advances the state-of-the-art in serving generative LLM models by maximizing throughput via predictions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes S3, a system to improve GPU utilization and throughput when serving large language models for text generation. The key idea is to predict the output sequence length for each text generation query, and allocate memory accordingly instead of overprovisioning memory. 

Specifically, S3 consists of three main components:

1) An output sequence length predictor based on a DistillBERT model, which predicts the length bucket that each query's output will fall into. This allows allocating near-optimal memory for each sequence's key/value cache.

2) A length-aware sequence scheduler that batches queries greedily into the GPU memory, utilizing the length predictions from the first component. This increases GPU utilization and throughput by packing more sequences into each batch.

3) A supervisor module that handles mispredictions by the predictor, preempting sequences that exceed allocated memory and retraining the predictor. This provides robustness against inaccurate predictions.

By predicting output lengths rather than overprovisioning, and batching sequences efficiently, S3 is able to achieve up to 6.49x higher throughput than baseline systems that assume worst-case sequence lengths. The key enabler is utilizing predictions to allocate memory optimally per sequence.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is trying to address is the inefficient memory utilization when serving large language models (LLMs) for text generation on GPUs. Specifically:

- LLMs require massive amounts of memory due to the large model size and the key/value caches that store previous token information. This limits the batch size that can be processed on the GPU, resulting in underutilization of GPU compute resources.

- Existing serving systems either constantly reallocate memory like HuggingFace Transformers, which has high latency, or preallocate maximum memory like NVIDIA FasterTransformer, which wastes memory. 

- The core issue is that current systems lack knowledge about the output sequence length, so they cannot efficiently allocate memory and maximize GPU utilization.

To address this, the paper proposes a system called S3 that:

- Predicts the output sequence length using a small DistilBERT model. 

- Uses this to efficiently allocate memory for each sequence and batch/schedule sequences to maximize GPU utilization and throughput.

- Handles mispredictions and recovers from errors.

Overall, by predicting output lengths and tailoring memory allocation, S3 aims to optimize memory usage during deployment of Transformer LMs on GPUs to improve throughput. The key innovation is leveraging predictions to overcome the limitations of existing serving systems.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes S3, a system to maximize GPU utilization and throughput when serving transformer-based generative AI models. Generating text with large language models is very memory-intensive, limiting batch size and GPU usage. The key insight is that the memory needed grows with sequence length, but most systems allocate memory to handle maximum lengths, wasting memory. S3 includes three main components: (1) an output length predictor to estimate each sequence's length, (2) a scheduler that batches variable-length sequences based on the predictions to maximize GPU memory utilization, and (3) a supervisor that handles mispredictions by preempting sequences and retraining the predictor. Evaluations using models up to 175B parameters show S3 can increase throughput by up to 6.49x in offline scenarios and generate 6.49x more sequences in online scenarios with a latency constraint. S3 also matches the throughput of 10 GPUs using only 6, reducing cost. The predictor has high accuracy, and overhead from mispredictions is low. By predicting lengths and tailoring memory allocation, S3 expands the latency-throughput tradeoff frontier for serving generative models.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes S3, a system to maximize GPU utilization and throughput when serving large language models for text generation. The key insight is that current systems either allocate maximum memory per sequence, limiting batch size, or do frequent small allocations, hurting performance. S3 uses a lightweight neural predictor to estimate sequence lengths before generation. Then a scheduler packs variable-length sequences into batches that maximize GPU usage without going out of memory. A supervisor handles cases where sequences exceed predicted lengths by preempting them, freeing space for other sequences. Experiments show S3 can generate up to 6.49x more sequences per second than current systems while meeting latency targets. The adaptive batching also allows S3 to match throughput of systems with more GPUs, improving cost-efficiency. Overall, S3 expands the latency-throughput tradeoff envelope by predicting sequence lengths and managing memory and scheduling accordingly.
