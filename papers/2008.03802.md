# [SpeedySpeech: Efficient Neural Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03802)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop a text-to-speech system that achieves fast training, fast inference, and high-quality audio synthesis simultaneously. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) A convolutional teacher-student model can achieve fast and stable training compared to autoregressive models like Tacotron 2.

2) Self-attention layers are not necessary in the student network to achieve high quality synthesis. Simple convolutional architecture is sufficient.

3) Their proposed student-teacher model with convolutional blocks can match or exceed the voice quality of strong baselines like Tacotron 2 and DeepVoice 3.

4) Their model can synthesize speech significantly faster than real-time on both CPU and GPU hardware.

5) The entire model can be trained efficiently on a single GPU within a reasonable time frame.

In summary, the central research aim is developing an efficient and fast text-to-speech system without sacrificing output quality. The key hypotheses focus on using a convolutional student-teacher framework to achieve fast training and inference while matching state-of-the-art voice quality.
