# [SpeedySpeech: Efficient Neural Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03802)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop a text-to-speech system that achieves fast training, fast inference, and high-quality audio synthesis simultaneously. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) A convolutional teacher-student model can achieve fast and stable training compared to autoregressive models like Tacotron 2.

2) Self-attention layers are not necessary in the student network to achieve high quality synthesis. Simple convolutional architecture is sufficient.

3) Their proposed student-teacher model with convolutional blocks can match or exceed the voice quality of strong baselines like Tacotron 2 and DeepVoice 3.

4) Their model can synthesize speech significantly faster than real-time on both CPU and GPU hardware.

5) The entire model can be trained efficiently on a single GPU within a reasonable time frame.

In summary, the central research aim is developing an efficient and fast text-to-speech system without sacrificing output quality. The key hypotheses focus on using a convolutional student-teacher framework to achieve fast training and inference while matching state-of-the-art voice quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a fast and efficient neural text-to-speech system based on a teacher-student model. Specifically:

- They propose a convolutional teacher model to extract alignments between phonemes and spectrogram frames. This model is simpler and faster to train than prior work like Tacotron 2.

- They propose a student model to generate mel spectrograms from phonemes and predicted durations. The student model uses only convolutional layers, avoiding slow self-attention layers like in Transformer or FastSpeech. 

- They show the model can be trained quickly on one GPU, with better audio quality than Tacotron 2 and Deep Voice 3 baselines.

- The model achieves real-time spectrogram synthesis on GPU and 5x faster than real-time on CPU. This is much faster than prior attentional TTS models.

- They simplify the FastSpeech architecture by removing self-attention and using different normalization, achieving a fast and stable training procedure.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that high-quality, faster-than-real-time neural speech synthesis is possible with a simplified teacher-student convolutional model, without relying on self-attention. The model is both fast to train and fast to run on CPU/GPU hardware.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a fast and efficient neural text-to-speech model consisting of a teacher network that extracts alignments and a student network that generates high quality spectrograms faster than real-time, while requiring less data and compute resources than recent neural TTS models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other recent research in spectrogram-based speech synthesis:

- It proposes a teacher-student architecture inspired by FastSpeech but with some key simplifications like replacing Transformer blocks with convolutional blocks. This makes the model smaller and faster compared to the original FastSpeech.

- The authors show that high quality spectrogram synthesis is possible without any self-attention layers, which were used extensively in models like Tacotron 2 and Transformer TTS. Replacing them with dilated convolutions makes the model simpler.

- For a vocoder, the paper uses MelGAN which is a smaller and faster neural vocoder compared to WaveNet. This enables real-time speech synthesis on CPU.

- The combined model achieves significantly higher quality than Tacotron 2 as rated by human listeners, while being much faster to train and synthesize. The training time on a single GPU is under 40 hours.

- Compared to Parallel WaveNet which also enables fast inference, this model does not require separately training a complex teacher network. The teacher here is simpler and faster to train.

- Overall, the focus is on creating an end-to-end spectrogram synthesis model that is fast, lightweight and high quality. The simplifications compared to previous work like FastSpeech and use of MelGAN allow the model to be very performant.

In summary, the key novelty is in showing that self-attention and complex teacher models are not needed for high-quality real-time spectrogram synthesis. The proposed simplifications make the model smaller, faster and easier to train compared to previous approaches while maintaining high voice quality.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Extending the model to support multi-speaker training data. The current model is trained on a single speaker dataset (LJ Speech). The authors suggest extending it to handle multiple speakers.

- Exploring use of higher quality neural vocoders. The authors used MelGAN for vocoding in their experiments. They suggest that using a higher quality vocoder may help reveal more differences in quality when comparing models.

- Testing the impact of the SSIM loss function with a better vocoder. Currently they did not see a big impact from using SSIM vs just L1 loss during spectrogram generation. But they hypothesize a better vocoder may reveal more differences.

- Exploring modifications to the model architecture. For example, removing the positional encodings or changing the loss functions. The authors tested some variants already but suggest more exploration could be done.

- Comparing directly to other recent efficient synthesis models like FastSpeech. They were not able to compare directly in their experiments so suggest doing this comparison.

- Testing the model on other languages beyond English. The model may need modifications to handle other languages well.

- Optimizing inference speed further via methods like weight pruning or quantization. The authors got good performance already but suggest more optimization could be done.

In summary, the main directions are: supporting multiple speakers, integrating with higher-quality vocoders, comparing to other recent models, testing on more languages, and optimizing the models further. The authors lay out a good roadmap for extending their work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a convolutional teacher-student model for fast and high quality text-to-speech synthesis. The teacher model extracts alignments between phonemes and spectrogram frames.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of building an efficient neural text-to-speech system that can be trained quickly, run in real-time, and generate high quality audio output. The key problems/questions it is trying to tackle are:

- Recent neural TTS systems like Tacotron 2 have high quality output but are slow to train and synthesize speech. Can we build a model that trains quickly and runs fast while maintaining good audio quality?

- Self-attention layers like those in Transformer have become popular in TTS, but they are computationally expensive. Can we get good results without using self-attention? 

- Teacher-student methods have been proposed to accelerate TTS training, but often still rely on slow autoregressive or flow-based teachers. Can we use a faster convolutional teacher instead?

- How can we make training more stable and avoid issues like error propagation in autoregressive models?

- Is it better to predict spectrograms with global positional encodings for the whole utterance or reset encodings for each phoneme?

- How does our model compare to strong baselines like Tacotron 2 and Deep Voice 3 in terms of quality, speed, and ease of training?

In summary, the key focus is designing a TTS model that is significantly faster, easier to train, and less resource intensive while still achieving high speech quality. The paper explores convolutional architectures, teacher-student training, and other techniques to address these challenges.
