# [Data Ethics Emergency Drill: A Toolbox for Discussing Responsible AI for   Industry Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10438)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current responsible AI solutions like frameworks, checklists, and regulations are often too abstract and lack context to be useful for data science practitioners. 
- Practitioners need context-specific tools to discuss ethical implications and make values embedded in their systems explicit.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors designed the "Data Ethics Emergency Drill" (DEED), a roleplay method where data science teams act out realistic scenarios dealing with ethical dilemmas related to their work.

- The DEED has practitioners collaboratively craft urgent fictional scenarios that:
  - Test their current processes
  - Provide practice having ethical conversations 
  - Reveal impacts of design decisions on society

- Scenarios escalate over a 1 hour online meeting with fake emails/presentations. 

- After the drill, participants reflect on takeaways for themselves and the team processes.

Contributions:
- Instructions for facilitating the DEED with practitioner teams, including activities for crafting scenarios.

- Evaluation of DEED iterations with 2 industry teams showed:
  - Scenarios were realistic enough to enable useful discussions.
  - Built confidence in having challenging conversations. 
  - Yielded concrete improvements to responsible AI processes.
  - Had lasting impact on conversations around ethics.

- Analysis highlights DEED incorporates friction, consequentiality, and mapping responsibilities.

- Proposes DEED as a new method where data science teams can link abstract ethics concepts to their specific work contexts.

In summary, the paper presents the Data Ethics Emergency Drill, an innovative roleplay method for data science teams to confront concrete dilemmas related to the ethics and values of their systems. Evaluations demonstrate the DEEDâ€™s ability to enable insightful discussions and responsible AI improvements grounded in practitioners' real-world contexts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an iterative research through design method called the Data Ethics Emergency Drill (DEED) which involves crafting realistic ethical dilemma scenarios with data science teams and having them act out responses, in order to make values in AI systems explicit, test responsible innovation processes, and provide a space for teams to practice ethical discussions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called the Data Ethics Emergency Drill (DEED) to help data science teams discuss and reflect on the ethical implications of their work. The DEED involves crafting realistic yet fictional emergency scenarios that are situated in the team's specific work context, and then having team members roleplay responding to the emergency. 

The paper outlines an iterative research through design process to develop the DEED method, provides guidelines on how to structure the drill, and presents findings from running the drill with two industry data science teams. The key findings are:

- The DEED provided a safe yet realistic space for teams to explore potential ethical dilemmas related to their work. It helped reveal assumptions and make values embedded in their systems more apparent.

- It opened up conversations around ethics and responsibilities within the teams, sharpening people's awareness of their role in addressing issues. There were lasting impacts in terms of continued conversations and changes to responsible AI practices.

- The main contribution is this novel method that elicits linking abstract ethics concepts to the practical details of a team's unique context. By beingembedded and consequential, it addresses limitations around abstractness and lack of context in current responsible AI solutions.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating a new responsible AI method that is situated, embedded within real organizational contexts, and helps teams reflect on and improve their ethical practices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Data ethics emergency drill (DEED) - The main method proposed in the paper for helping data science teams discuss and reflect on ethical implications of their work through roleplaying emergency scenarios.

- Contextual relevance - A key goal of the DEED method is to create scenarios that are realistic and relevant to the specific work context of a data science team.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the DEED method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the DEED provides a "safe space" for teams to explore ethical dilemmas. In what ways does the DEED methodology encourage psychological safety during these discussions? How could the structure be adapted to foster more or less debate among participants?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of crafting realistic and contextually relevant scenarios. What factors should be considered when designing appropriate emergency scenarios? How might the scenario design process differ across teams in different industries or companies? 

3. The findings show the DEED helped participants link abstract principles to practical manifestations in their organizations. What elements of the methodology facilitated making these connections? How did the reflection process contribute to this?

4. The paper proposes the DEED can make team members' values and priorities more apparent. In what ways did the drill reveal or challenge individual participants' assumptions and beliefs? What methods could elicit more diversity of opinion?

5. The drill is intended to test teams' processes for addressing ethical issues. What indicators demonstrated whether current processes were adequate or needed improvement? How were strengths and weaknesses of processes exposed?

6. One proposed outcome is that the DEED can help teams build confidence in discussing complex issues. What evidence indicates the drill achieved this? What factors may have contributed to increased confidence?

7. The findings revealed the DEED sparked ongoing conversations about ethics and values. What motivated these continued discussions? How did the drill experience transfer to handling real situations?

8. What limitations of the evaluation methods make it difficult to fully assess the long-term impact on teams? What additional indicators over time could supplement the self-reported data?  

9. The paper offers guidelines for structuring successful drills. What adaptations may be necessary for teams in different companies or industries? How customizable is this framework?

10. One future direction is engaging end users in co-designing drills. What considerations would this introduce compared to internal scenarios? What benefits or challenges might it present?
