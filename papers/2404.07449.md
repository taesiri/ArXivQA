# [Learning to Localize Objects Improves Spatial Reasoning in Visual-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing visual-large language models (V-LLMs) like BLIP-2 and LLaVA show exceptional performance on vision-language tasks but have poor spatial reasoning and localization abilities. For example, they cannot distinguish if an object is to the left or right of another object.

Solution: 
- The paper proposes a framework called "LocVLM" to inject spatial awareness into V-LLMs using textual spatial coordinates. 

- Three instruction fine-tuning objectives are introduced: Location Prediction, Negative Prediction, and Reverse-Location Prediction. These teach the model to process and generate image-space coordinates.

- Optimal textual coordinate representations are explored, including normalized floating points, integer binning, and deviation from anchors. Integer binning works best.

- Pseudo-data generation strategies leverage the model's own captions to improve region description and enable video domain training.

Contributions:
- Spatial reasoning and localization abilities are significantly improved in V-LLMs using textual coordinates
- LocVLM outperforms prior works in Image VQA, Video VQA, Region Description. It also reduces object hallucination.
- The framework is data-efficient, using identical annotations as baseline V-LLMs like LLaVA
- Pseudo-labelling and self-training allows scaling to video domain without extra annotations
- Unique capability of contextual region description is introduced 

In summary, this paper injects spatial awareness into V-LLMs using textual coordinates and instruction fine-tuning, enhancing their reasoning and reducing hallucination while still leveraging identical training data as baselines. The data-efficient pseudo-labelling also allows video domain scaling.
