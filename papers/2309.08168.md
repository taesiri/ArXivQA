# [Draft &amp; Verify: Lossless Large Language Model Acceleration via   Self-Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08168)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) without compromising output quality or needing additional models? The key hypothesis is that by selectively skipping certain intermediate layers during a "drafting" stage, the same LLM can generate draft tokens more quickly. Then the original LLM can verify these tokens in a single forward pass, ensuring output quality is maintained. This approach, termed "self-speculative decoding", allows accelerating LLM inference without extra models or loss of accuracy.In summary, the paper introduces and evaluates a novel inference scheme called self-speculative decoding to speed up LLM inference. The central hypothesis is that skipping some layers allows the LLM to draft tokens quickly, which can then be verified by the original LLM to maintain output quality, all without requiring additional models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel inference scheme called self-speculative decoding to accelerate large language models (LLMs) without needing an auxiliary model. This approach has two stages - drafting and verification. In the drafting stage, it generates draft tokens quickly by selectively skipping certain intermediate layers of the LLM. In the verification stage, the original LLM validates those draft tokens in one forward pass to ensure the final output quality. 2. It provides optimization strategies for self-speculative decoding:- It frames the layer selection as an optimization problem and leverages Bayesian optimization to determine which layers to skip during drafting. This allows balancing between speed and quality.- It introduces an adaptive draft-exiting mechanism to stop generating draft tokens once the confidence level drops below a threshold. This prevents wasting computation on draft tokens unlikely to be accepted.3. It evaluates the approach on summarization and code generation tasks. The results demonstrate up to 1.73x speedup without accuracy loss compared to standard autoregressive decoding.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and optimizing a practical self-speculative decoding approach that accelerates LLMs without extra training or memory overhead. The evaluations validate its effectiveness and efficiency.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a novel approach to accelerating inference for Large Language Models through a self-speculative decoding technique. Other recent work like FastSPEAR and BlockLM has also explored using speculative execution to speed up autoregressive decoding. However, the key difference is that this paper uses the model itself for both drafting and verification stages, while prior work relies on separate models. Avoiding an auxiliary model is advantageous since it eliminates the need to train or find a suitable draft model, especially for fine-tuned models.- Most prior work on LLM acceleration has focused on model compression techniques like distillation, pruning, and quantization. While effective, these methods require modifying the model architecture/training and do not maintain exact output quality. In contrast, this self-speculative decoding approach accelerates inference while producing identical outputs to the original model. The idea of using the model's existing computations more efficiently is fairly novel in the context of LLM optimization.- The technical approach builds upon principles from speculative execution in computer architecture but adapts it innovatively for neural sequence modeling. The use of Bayesian optimization to select layers to skip is not common in prior speculative decoding methods. Additionally, the adaptive draft length and acceptance rate monitoring are simple yet effective techniques not employed before.- This approach is evaluated on a more diverse set of models (LLaMa, LLaMa-Chat, CodeLLaMa) compared to prior work on speculative decoding which was limited to GPT-style models. Testing on fine-tuned models also verifies wider applicability. The benchmarking provides convincing evidence of acceleration across domains while maintaining output quality.In summary, this self-speculative decoding technique represents a novel and pragmatic approach for LLM acceleration that maintains output quality. The method of leveraging the model's existing computations more efficiently sets it apart from prior work focused on model compression or requires additional models. The techniques and thorough evaluation expands our understanding of efficient inference for state-of-the-art LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring other potential strategies to accelerate the drafting stage, such as quantization and structured pruning. The authors mention that their method of skipping layers is a simple approach, but other compression techniques could be investigated to further speed up drafting. - Enhancing the adaptive draft-exiting mechanism, potentially by incorporating more sophisticated confidence estimates beyond just token probabilities. The authors suggest future work could explore other techniques to determine when to stop generating draft tokens.- Evaluating the approach on other domains and tasks beyond text summarization and code generation. The authors demonstrate effectiveness on those two tasks, but note the method could be assessed more broadly.- Combining self-speculative decoding with other inference optimization methods, such as input processing strategies like prompt tuning. The authors propose their method as a general acceleration technique that could potentially be combined with other optimizations.- Developing specialized hardware and systems to better optimize and support the two-stage drafting and verification process. The authors suggest co-designing algorithms and systems to fully utilize hardware efficiency.- Exploring variations on the self-speculative decoding idea, such as using multiple models or incorporating reinforcement learning. The core conceptual approach could potentially be expanded in creative new directions.In summary, the authors propose a range of promising avenues to build and improve upon their self-speculative decoding technique through novel drafting methods, adaptive optimizations, expanded applications, integration with other acceleration techniques, specialized hardware, and innovative extensions to the core approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel inference scheme called self-speculative decoding to accelerate large language models (LLMs) without needing an auxiliary model. The approach has two stages - drafting and verification. In the drafting stage, it generates draft tokens quickly by selectively skipping some intermediate layers of the LLM during inference. Then in the verification stage, it validates those draft tokens using the original unmodified LLM in one forward pass, accepting or rejecting each token. This ensures the final output remains identical to that from standard autoregressive decoding of the LLM. To determine which layers to skip, the method frames it as an optimization problem and uses Bayesian optimization to select an optimal subset. It also adaptively decides when to stop generating draft tokens based on a confidence threshold that is dynamically updated according to the acceptance rate. Experiments using LLaMA-2 and its fine-tuned models on summarization and code generation tasks demonstrate speedups of up to 1.73x, with no loss of output quality or need for model retraining. The approach provides a practical way to accelerate LLMs at inference time without extra memory overhead.
