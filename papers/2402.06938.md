# [Efficient Resource Scheduling for Distributed Infrastructures Using   Negotiation Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- With the rapid growth of data, enterprises and individuals are increasingly relying on cloud infrastructure providers to host their applications. However, the agreements reached between providers and clients are often inefficient due to factors like underutilized capacity on the provider side and additional costs to clients.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes an agent-based auto-negotiation system for resource scheduling to reach more efficient agreements. The system consists of a client agent that uses fuzzy logic to evaluate offers, and a provider agent that dynamically generates offers based on algorithms.

- The fuzzy logic component of the client agent mimics human decision making with components like membership functions, fuzzy rule sets, and defuzzification. The provider uses algorithms to generate first offers and update subsequent offers based on client feedback.

- The system supports multiple negotiation cases based on the level of feedback from the client - accept/reject only, accept/reject + advice on which resource to reduce, priority-based advice.

- The paper also proposes replacing the fuzzy negotiation system with machine learning models to improve efficiency while preserving interpretability. Models with non-linear layers are shown to effectively simulate fuzzy negotiation.

Main Contributions:

- Design of a fuzzy logic-based auto-negotiation system with novel parameters and algorithms that can efficiently schedule cloud infrastructure resources.

- Systematic study of using ML models as surrogates for the entire fuzzy negotiation system to improve speed.

- Comparison of different system components like membership functions, rule sets and support for multiple negotiation cases.

- Proposal and demonstration of a workflow that provides both trustworthy and efficient scheduling by combining fuzzy systems and ML.

In summary, the paper presents a novel negotiation-based system for cloud resource scheduling that is interpretable, customizable and significantly more efficient than manual negotiation.
