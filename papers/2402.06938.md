# [Efficient Resource Scheduling for Distributed Infrastructures Using   Negotiation Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- With the rapid growth of data, enterprises and individuals are increasingly relying on cloud infrastructure providers to host their applications. However, the agreements reached between providers and clients are often inefficient due to factors like underutilized capacity on the provider side and additional costs to clients.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes an agent-based auto-negotiation system for resource scheduling to reach more efficient agreements. The system consists of a client agent that uses fuzzy logic to evaluate offers, and a provider agent that dynamically generates offers based on algorithms.

- The fuzzy logic component of the client agent mimics human decision making with components like membership functions, fuzzy rule sets, and defuzzification. The provider uses algorithms to generate first offers and update subsequent offers based on client feedback.

- The system supports multiple negotiation cases based on the level of feedback from the client - accept/reject only, accept/reject + advice on which resource to reduce, priority-based advice.

- The paper also proposes replacing the fuzzy negotiation system with machine learning models to improve efficiency while preserving interpretability. Models with non-linear layers are shown to effectively simulate fuzzy negotiation.

Main Contributions:

- Design of a fuzzy logic-based auto-negotiation system with novel parameters and algorithms that can efficiently schedule cloud infrastructure resources.

- Systematic study of using ML models as surrogates for the entire fuzzy negotiation system to improve speed.

- Comparison of different system components like membership functions, rule sets and support for multiple negotiation cases.

- Proposal and demonstration of a workflow that provides both trustworthy and efficient scheduling by combining fuzzy systems and ML.

In summary, the paper presents a novel negotiation-based system for cloud resource scheduling that is interpretable, customizable and significantly more efficient than manual negotiation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an agent-based auto-negotiation system using fuzzy logic and machine learning to efficiently schedule cloud computing resources between providers and clients.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Designing and developing a framework for 1-to-1 negotiation to schedule resources in a distributed infrastructure. Different negotiation cases are supported through a fuzzy logic system with novel input parameters and fuzzy rules to evaluate offers. The offers are updated using several new algorithms during the negotiation process.

2. Systematically and comprehensively studying the feasibility of using neural network surrogate models to replace the entire fuzzy negotiation process, which is novel compared to only replacing single-round outcomes as done in prior work. 

3. Proposing a combined approach of using machine learning models and fuzzy negotiation that provides a trustworthy, interpretable, and efficient scheduling method for resources. The fuzzy negotiation provides interpretability while the machine learning models significantly improve efficiency.

In summary, the key contributions are around the fuzzy negotiation framework, evaluating machine learning for replacing the entire negotiation, and the combined approach to get the best of both interpretability and efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Fuzzy negotiation system - A system based on fuzzy logic that is used to simulate negotiation between a client agent and a provider agent for resource scheduling. It evaluates offers and makes decisions.

- Auto-negotiation - An automated negotiation process between agents to reach agreements on resource allocation and pricing.

- Surrogate modeling - Using machine learning models like neural networks to replace and simulate the fuzzy negotiation system to improve efficiency.

- Interpretability - The fuzzy negotiation system provides transparency into the negotiation process and final agreements, allowing the outcomes to be understandable and trusted. The machine learning models aim to preserve this.  

- Distributed computing infrastructures - The context of the negotiation is providing and allocating resources for distributed computing systems like cloud platforms.

- Agents - Software agents are used to represent the client/tenant and the infrastructure provider to conduct automated negotiations.

- Offers - Proposals made during the negotiation process that contain resource quantities and pricing terms. The agents exchange offers.

- Fuzzy logic - Used to implement anthropomorphic and interpretable decision making for evaluating offers and concessions during automated negotiation.

So in summary, key ideas revolve around using fuzzy logic and machine learning for automated, efficient, and interpretable negotiation of resource allocation in distributed computing systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an agent-based auto-negotiation system for resource scheduling. What are the key differences between this approach and more traditional optimization methods for resource scheduling? What unique benefits does the negotiation-based approach offer?

2. The client agent uses a fuzzy logic system to evaluate offers, while the provider agent uses algorithms to generate offers. Why was fuzzy logic chosen to model the client agent's decision making? What advantages does it have over other techniques? 

3. The paper experiments with different membership functions and rule sets for the fuzzy logic system. How significant is the impact of these choices on the negotiation outcomes and system performance? What guidance does this provide for configuring fuzzy logic systems effectively?

4. Three different negotiation cases are explored. What are the key features of each case and what real-world scenarios are they intended to model? How do the cases differ in terms of negotiation dynamics and outcomes?

5. Surrogate machine learning models are proposed to replace the fuzzy negotiation systems. What measures were taken to ensure the ML models provide similar outputs? How was interpretability maintained when using the ML models?

6. What neural network architectures were explored for the surrogate models? Why was the architecture with a ReLU layer more effective at fitting the fuzzy negotiation system?

7. The negotiation process involves dynamically updating provider offers based on client feedback. How do the different offer update algorithms balance exploration and exploitation to efficiently reach agreements?

8. How scalable is the proposed framework in terms of negotiating over more parameters or handling larger volumes of tenant requests? What enhancements could improve scalability?  

9. Could the auto-negotiation system be applied to other resource allocation contexts such as bandwidth scheduling or job scheduling on clusters? What modifications would need to be made?

10. The paper mentions adaptive fuzzy rule systems as a potential enhancement. How could machine learning be used to automatically evolve better fuzzy rule sets over time as more negotiation data becomes available?
