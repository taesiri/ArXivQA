# [Managing the unknown: a survey on Open Set Recognition and tangential   areas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08785)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the field of Open Set Recognition (OSR), which focuses on developing machine learning models that can reliably perform classification in open-world environments where unknown classes may emerge at test time. The authors establish common conceptual grounds on OSR, clarify its connections with related research areas like novelty detection, continual learning, out-of-distribution detection, and uncertainty estimation, and taxonomize recent OSR methodologies into discriminative approaches that tighten class boundaries and generative methods that synthesize unknown class data. They especially highlight the promise of hybrid discriminative methods that combine clustering algorithms, which naturally partition feature spaces, and classification models. After thoroughly surveying OSR techniques and applications, the authors discuss open challenges like managing open space risk, computing optimal thresholds, simultaneously hybridizing clustering and classification, identifying new classes over time, updating models incrementally, and disentangling complex class distributions. They suggest research directions around exploiting temporal correlations, incorporating domain knowledge, and preventing catastrophic forgetting to push OSR towards safer and more autonomous AI. Overall, this review motivates and guides future efforts to develop more reliable open-world recognition models.
