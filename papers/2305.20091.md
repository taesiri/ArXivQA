# [Humans in 4D: Reconstructing and Tracking Humans with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20091)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can a fully transformer-based architecture achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3D human pose and shape estimation from a single image? 2) Can improved single image 3D pose estimation, when incorporated into a tracking pipeline, lead to state-of-the-art performance on multi-person 3D tracking in video?3) Does the proposed transformer-based human mesh recovery method, when used for pose-based action recognition, outperform previous pose-based methods on this task?The authors propose a new transformer-based approach called HMR 2.0 for estimating 3D human pose and shape from images. They show it outperforms previous methods on standard 3D pose estimation benchmarks. They then incorporate HMR 2.0 into a 3D tracking pipeline called 4DHumans to jointly reconstruct and track people in videos. This system with improved pose estimation achieves state-of-the-art multi-person 3D tracking results.Finally, they demonstrate the effectiveness of HMR 2.0 poses on the downstream task of action recognition, where they are able to significantly outperform previous pose-based methods.So in summary, the main research questions relate to pushing the state-of-the-art in 3D human pose/shape estimation and multi-person 3D tracking via a transformer-based approach, and showing the improved pose estimates translate to gains in action recognition.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can we develop an end-to-end transformer architecture for human mesh recovery from a single image that outperforms previous approaches without relying on domain-specific designs? - Can we use the proposed HMR 2.0 model to build a system that jointly reconstructs and tracks humans over time in videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance?- Will the improved 3D poses from HMR 2.0 result in better performance on downstream tasks like action recognition compared to previous pose estimation methods?In summary, the key goals seem to be:1) Developing a fully transformer-based architecture for human mesh recovery that advances the state-of-the-art. 2) Using this as the backbone for a complete system (4DHumans) that can reconstruct and track humans in videos.3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the recovered poses on downstream tasks like action recognition.The central hypothesis appears to be that a transformer-based approach can outperform previous specialized CNN architectures for human pose and shape estimation, while also enabling state-of-the-art performance when incorporated into video analysis pipelines.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of 3D human pose and shape estimation:- The main novelty of this paper is the fully "transformerized" architecture for human mesh recovery, which they call HMR 2.0. Most prior work uses CNN backbones, sometimes with added transformer layers. By using a pure transformer architecture based on ViT, the authors are able to achieve state-of-the-art results without relying on domain-specific architectural designs.- The proposed HMR 2.0 model outperforms previous methods on standard 3D pose estimation benchmarks like 3DPW and Human3.6M. More interestingly, it also significantly outperforms others on 2D keypoint projection metrics, indicating it can better handle more extreme poses not well represented in the common benchmarks.- For video pose estimation and tracking, this paper builds on top of prior work like PHALP. The main novelty is the improved pose predictions from HMR 2.0, which leads to state-of-the-art multi-person tracking results. Most prior video pose estimation work focuses on constrained single person settings.- The application of HMR 2.0 to action recognition, where it also outperforms prior pose-based methods, further demonstrates the higher quality of the reconstructed poses. This is a useful downstream application for evaluating pose estimation.- The end-to-end transformer design of HMR 2.0 is conceptually simpler compared to many other works that incorporate specialized architectural components for handling occlusion, leveraging hierarchies, aligning parts, etc. This work shows these complex designs may not be needed.Overall, the transformer-based single-image pose estimation model, when coupled with existing video pose tracking frameworks, seems highly effective for pushing the state of the art in challenging in-the-wild scenarios. The design is clean and simple compared to other recent works, while achieving top results, highlighting the power of transformers for modeling human pose.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on human pose estimation and tracking:- The main novelty is the fully transformer-based architecture for human mesh recovery (HMR 2.0). Most prior work uses CNN backbones like ResNet, so replacing this with a Vision Transformer (ViT) is a major change. - For tracking, this paper builds on prior work like PHALP but simplifies it and adapts it to use the SMPL pose space rather than CNN features. This makes the tracking framework more general.- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both 3D pose estimation metrics and on tracking benchmarks like PoseTrack. This shows the benefits of the transformer architecture and training methodology.- For pose estimation, this approach still uses SMPL model fitting like previous work. Some recent papers have explored non-parametric mesh prediction which is a different approach.- For video, this method processes each frame independently. Some other works incorporate more temporal modeling in the network architecture.- The paper shows application of the pose estimates to action recognition, demonstrating how improved 3D poses translate to gains on downstream tasks.Overall, the core novelty is in the transformer architecture and training methodology, leading to improved results. But it builds on a lot of prior research in pose estimation and tracking frameworks. The results validate the benefits of transformers for human analysis as has been shown in other areas.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring improved body models beyond SMPL to capture aspects like hand pose, facial expressions, and greater age variation. The paper mentions that using SMPL creates limitations, so moving to more expressive models could help with capturing finer details.- Capturing interactions between people in close proximity more accurately, like modeling contact. The paper notes their approach considers each person independently so struggles with finer details when people are very close. - Moving to a common world coordinate frame rather than just camera frames. They suggest this is needed for fuller understanding of actions in videos by reasoning about camera motion.- Improving performance on lower resolution inputs, such as through resolution augmentation techniques. The authors state lower input resolution can affect reconstruction quality.- Exploring generative models and simulations more thoroughly for tasks like tracking. This is suggested as a way to better deal with occlusion events during tracking.- Further scaling up and pre-training the models on more data from diverse sources to improve robustness. The paper presents their model as a large pre-trained model for human analysis that could enable many downstream applications.So in summary, some key directions mentioned are leveraging more expressive body models, better capturing close interactions, reasoning in 3D scene coordinates, handling lower resolutions, using generative models for occlusion handling, and scaling up pre-training. The authors seem to frame future work in terms of overcoming current limitations to enable more detailed human analysis.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests several promising future research directions:1. Leveraging improved body models beyond SMPL to enable modeling of hand pose, facial expressions, greater age variation, etc.2. Capturing fine-grained interactions between people in close proximity, like contact and support relationships, by going beyond modeling each person independently.3. Reasoning about camera motion and scene geometry to place reconstructions in a common world coordinate frame instead of just the camera frame. This could better capture the action in a full video. 4. Improving performance on lower resolution inputs through techniques like resolution augmentation.5. Exploring alternative model architectures and losses, like graph neural networks or adversarial/implicit losses on the 3D shape.6. Pre-training on massive internet video datasets or with self-supervision from multiview footage to learn even more robust pose priors.7. Extending the approach to leverage temporal information and model dynamics for smoother tracked motion and handling longer-term occlusions.8. Combining tracking with segmentation to enable per-pixel reconstruction and interaction modeling.In summary, the paper provides a strong transformer-based framework for human pose estimation and tracking, while highlighting many interesting opportunities for future work to address limitations and build on this approach. The power of large pretrained models is clearly demonstrated, motivating their continued application to open challenges in modeling, reconstructing and understanding people in images and videos.
