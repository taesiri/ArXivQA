# [Unsupervised multiple choices question answering via universal corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) requires large-scale annotated datasets which are costly to obtain for new domains. 
- Existing unsupervised methods for MCQA still rely on some labeled data from the target domain.
- The paper studies a more challenging but meaningful problem setting - unsupervised MCQA with only a universal corpus, without any labeled data from the target domain. 

Proposed Method:
- A two-stage framework to construct MCQA samples from scratch using just a universal corpus:
   1) Question-answer pair generation: Named entities are extracted as answer candidates, questions are generated using cloze-style translation.
   2) Distractor generation: Proposes NE-based, KG-based and a hybrid KG-NE method to generate high-quality distractors.

Main Contributions:
- Among the first to study fully unsupervised MCQA without any labeled target domain data.
- Propose a two-stage method for synthetic MCQA data generation. 
- Show KG-NE hybrid distractor generation method is most effective.
- Achieve reasonable performance on multiple MCQA datasets using just synthetic data, demonstrate impact of different distractor generation techniques.

In summary, the paper proposes an unsupervised two-stage approach to generate synthetic training data for MCQA when no labeled data is available in the target domain. The hybrid KG-NE distractor generation method is shown to be most effective. Results on multiple MCQA datasets demonstrate the promise of their framework.
