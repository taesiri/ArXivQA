# [Unsupervised multiple choices question answering via universal corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) requires large-scale annotated datasets which are costly to obtain for new domains. 
- Existing unsupervised methods for MCQA still rely on some labeled data from the target domain.
- The paper studies a more challenging but meaningful problem setting - unsupervised MCQA with only a universal corpus, without any labeled data from the target domain. 

Proposed Method:
- A two-stage framework to construct MCQA samples from scratch using just a universal corpus:
   1) Question-answer pair generation: Named entities are extracted as answer candidates, questions are generated using cloze-style translation.
   2) Distractor generation: Proposes NE-based, KG-based and a hybrid KG-NE method to generate high-quality distractors.

Main Contributions:
- Among the first to study fully unsupervised MCQA without any labeled target domain data.
- Propose a two-stage method for synthetic MCQA data generation. 
- Show KG-NE hybrid distractor generation method is most effective.
- Achieve reasonable performance on multiple MCQA datasets using just synthetic data, demonstrate impact of different distractor generation techniques.

In summary, the paper proposes an unsupervised two-stage approach to generate synthetic training data for MCQA when no labeled data is available in the target domain. The hybrid KG-NE distractor generation method is shown to be most effective. Results on multiple MCQA datasets demonstrate the promise of their framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised framework for multiple-choice question answering that generates synthetic training data from a universal corpus, including question-answer pairs and plausible distractors using named entities and knowledge graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions are summarized as follows:

1. The authors propose one of the first approaches to study the unsupervised multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) task without any data available in the target domain. They propose a two-stage framework for generating synthetic MCQA data from a universal corpus.

2. The first stage generates question-answer pairs in an extractive way, by extracting named entities from contexts as answers and generating corresponding questions via unsupervised machine translation. 

3. The second stage generates plausible distractors to form the full MCQA samples, using both named entities and knowledge graphs. A hybrid KG-NE method is proposed to generate high-quality distractors.

4. Extensive experiments verify the validity of the proposed approach and also illustrate the impact of different answer distractor generation methods on the performance. The hybrid KG-NE method for distractor generation is shown to be the most effective.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel unsupervised framework for MCQA that can work without any labeled data in the target domain. The framework relies on synthetic data generation using universal corpora and is shown empirically to achieve good performance.
