# [Unsupervised Learning of Harmonic Analysis Based on Neural HSMM with   Code Quality Templates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04135)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Harmonic analysis is the process of representing a musical piece as a sequence of chord labels, which helps understand the structure of the music. It involves simultaneously identifying keys and chords, making it challenging to perform in an unsupervised manner.
- Previous unsupervised harmonic analysis methods relied on manual design of model parameters, limiting the feasibility of fully automated analysis.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an unsupervised harmonic analysis method based on a neural hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM).
- The HSMM comprises probability distributions for initial state, state transitions, state durations, and observations. Neural networks are used to approximate these distributions to enable unsupervised learning.
- Chord quality templates are set manually to enable mapping the learned hidden states to known chord labels. The rest of the model parameters are learned automatically from non-labeled data.
- A two phase training approach is used - first using normalized data without key signatures, then additional training using original data with modulation and key shifts enabled.
- After training, Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of hidden state (key-root combinations) given an observation sequence. The chord quality is determined based on the hidden state.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first fully automated unsupervised harmonic analysis method, without needing manual elaboration of model parameters or rules.
- Introduces chord quality templates to map learned hidden states to known chord labels like Roman numerals.
- Shows the learned root transition probabilities can find the tonic without prior assumption.
- Provides first quantitative scores for unsupervised harmonic analysis on Bach chorales datasets and compares with other methods.
- Discusses examples of obtained analysis, issues like passing tone detection, and potential applications for other music genres.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an unsupervised harmonic analysis method based on a neural hidden semi-Markov model with manually designed chord quality templates, which provides comparable performance to supervised methods without requiring labeled data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for unsupervised learning of harmonic analysis based on a neural hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). Specifically:

- The paper presents an unsupervised approach to learning model parameters which has been difficult in previous harmonic analysis research. Only the chord quality templates are set manually.

- The model can simultaneously recognize keys and chords for harmonic analysis without assuming the two modes are major and minor or restricting the tonic notes. 

- The model is able to find the minor and major modes and their tonic notes properly through the learned root transition probabilities, as discussed in Section 4.4.

- The paper demonstrates the potential of unsupervised learning for harmonic analysis, despite the evaluation results showing there is still room for improvement compared to supervised methods.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing unsupervised learning for harmonic analysis by enabling more model parameters to be learned automatically and evaluating the current capability of the approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper utilizes chord quality templates to enable harmonic analysis with known chord labels. How are these chord quality templates designed and implemented in the model? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using preset templates versus learning them?

2) The model employs a neural hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). What are the benefits of using an HSMM over a regular HMM for this task of harmonic analysis? How does the semi-Markov property help capture musical structure? 

3) The training is done in two phases - first on normalized data without modulations, then on original data with modulations enabled. What is the motivation behind this two-phase approach? How does it impact learning?

4) The model finds the tonic based on the stationary distribution of the root transition probability matrix. Why is this a better approach than simply using pitch class distribution? How robust is this method to variations in musical style?

5) How can the proposed model be extended to handle non-diatonic harmony like borrowed chords? What modifications would be needed? Would a non-parametric model work better?

6) One issue noted is excess labeling of passing tones. What mechanisms can be incorporated to distinguish these better? How can the generative process be adapted accordingly?

7) The model quality is evaluated on Bach chorales which have clear harmonic structure. How would performance change on more complex music like jazz/pop? What are the current limitations?

8) Can this model work in a multi-modal setting by incorporating audio features along with symbolic data? What architectural changes would be needed to enable that fusion?

9) How can we assess if the model has truly discovered musical structure in an unsupervised way? Are the learned latent spaces musically meaningful?

10) The model does not explicitly output metrical structure. How can beat/downbeat be incorporated as additional outputs? Would a hierarchical model work better?
