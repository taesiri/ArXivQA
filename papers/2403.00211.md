# [Trustworthy Self-Attention: Enabling the Network to Focus Only on the   Most Relevant References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Estimating optical flow for occluded points is difficult since they are not visible in the matching frame. 
- Prior self-attention methods for finding reference points have two issues: 1) They rely only on visual features from a single frame so cannot effectively exclude occluded points, resulting in erroneous references (untrustworthy). 2) Due to insufficient constraints, they exhibit distracted attention unable to focus on the most relevant references (weakly relevant).

Proposed Solution:
- Integrate online occlusion recognition into self-attention to identify and exclude occluded points (trustworthy).  
- Design two strong direct constraints:
  - Repulsion constraint: Set flow of occluded points to singular values so network learns not to focus on them (strongly relevant).  
  - Attraction constraint: Enforce attention of non-occluded points to focus solely on themselves (most relevant).
- Overall enables network to focus only on the most relevant non-occluded references.

Main Contributions:
- Construct occlusion extended feature representations to enable identifying and removing attention to occluded points
- Strong repulsion constraint enables network to learn occlusion-aware features and attend only to strongly relevant non-occluded points
- Strong attraction constraint further enhances attention capability so network focuses solely on the most relevant references
- Very lightweight with almost no added parameters
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel benchmarks, with much greater error reduction compared to prior arts

In summary, the paper integrates occlusion information into self-attention via occlusion-aware features and strong direct constraints to enable the network to focus only on the most relevant non-occluded reference points for estimating optical flow of occluded points. This achieves significantly improved optical flow accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new self-attention method for optical flow estimation that integrates online occlusion recognition to enable the network to focus only on the most relevant non-occluded reference points.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to enable the network to learn to focus only on the most relevant reference points for optical flow estimation, especially at occluded regions, by integrating online occlusion recognition information into the training and inference process of self-attention. Specifically:

1) It constructs occlusion extended feature representations to identify and exclude attention to occluded points. 

2) It designs a strong repulsion constraint so the network learns to focus only on strongly relevant non-occluded points. This makes the attention trustworthy.

3) It designs a strong attraction constraint so the network further learns to focus only on the most relevant non-occluded points. 

4) The method adds very few parameters and has the greatest cross-dataset generalization ability.

5) It achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel benchmarks, with significant error reductions compared to previous methods, especially on occluded regions.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling trustworthy and most relevant self-attention for optical flow estimation by integrating online occlusion recognition, through specially designed constraints and representations. This leads to significant performance improvements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that recent methods rely on visual features of a single image which are not sufficient to constrain the network to focus on erroneous and weakly relevant reference points. How exactly does the proposed method address this issue and constrain the network to focus only on the most relevant references?

2. The paper proposes occlusion extended visual features. How are these visual features constructed? What additional information do they provide compared to regular visual features from a single image? 

3. Explain the strong repulsion and strong attraction constraints proposed in the paper. How do these constraints enable the network to learn effective occlusion-aware feature representations?

4. The occlusion information recognizer used in the proposed method is parameter-free and does not require occlusion ground truth for training. How does this occlusion recognizer work? What are its advantages?

5. The paper argues previous methods have issues with untrustworthy and weakly relevant attention. Analyze the theoretical reasoning behind why the proposed Trustworthy Self-Attention (TSA) method provides more trustworthy and relevant attention.  

6. The ablation study incrementally adds various components of the proposed method. Analyze the results and explain how each component contributes to the overall performance improvement.

7. The performance of the method relies heavily on the occlusion information recognizer. Under what conditions does the recognizer fail or encounter challenges? How can this issue be addressed?  

8. Compare and contrast the weak indirect constraint used in MATCHFlow(GMA) and the weak direct constraint used in GMFlow. How does the proposed strong direct constraint differ?

9. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel Clean pass. Analyze the quantitative results and discuss why TSA outperforms other methods by a large margin on this dataset.  

10. The paper mentions the proposed method adds very few parameters compared to existing frameworks. Approximately how many additional parameters does TSA add? Discuss the benefits of a lightweight architecture.
