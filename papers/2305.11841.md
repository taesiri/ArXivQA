# [How Does Generative Retrieval Scale to Millions of Passages?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11841)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How effective are generative retrieval techniques when scaled up to large corpora with millions of documents, and which aspects of proposed methods remain important at scale?In particular, the paper aims to:- Evaluate popular generative retrieval techniques proposed in recent work, ablating their components on small datasets first. - Scale up experiments to the full MS MARCO passage retrieval corpus with 8.8 million passages, in order to understand how well current techniques work and what aspects are critical when scaling up corpus size.- Investigate the effect of scaling up model size for generative retrieval on large corpora.The key hypothesis appears to be that while certain techniques like synthetic query generation help on small datasets, different factors will be important for generative retrieval to work well at scale, which the paper aims to uncover through systematic experiments and analysis. The scalability of generative retrieval is the main open problem being explored.
