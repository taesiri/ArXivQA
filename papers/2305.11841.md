# [How Does Generative Retrieval Scale to Millions of Passages?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11841)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How effective are generative retrieval techniques when scaled up to large corpora with millions of documents, and which aspects of proposed methods remain important at scale?

In particular, the paper aims to:

- Evaluate popular generative retrieval techniques proposed in recent work, ablating their components on small datasets first. 

- Scale up experiments to the full MS MARCO passage retrieval corpus with 8.8 million passages, in order to understand how well current techniques work and what aspects are critical when scaling up corpus size.

- Investigate the effect of scaling up model size for generative retrieval on large corpora.

The key hypothesis appears to be that while certain techniques like synthetic query generation help on small datasets, different factors will be important for generative retrieval to work well at scale, which the paper aims to uncover through systematic experiments and analysis. The scalability of generative retrieval is the main open problem being explored.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is an empirical study of generative retrieval techniques on corpora of increasing scale, up to 8.8 million passages from the MS MARCO dataset. The key findings are:

- Synthetic query generation is critical for generative retrieval effectiveness at scale. Using only synthetic queries as document representations was the most effective approach as corpus size increased. 

- When accounting for compute costs, simple techniques like naive document IDs often outperformed more sophisticated methods like semantic IDs.

- Increasing model size is necessary but not sufficient - effectiveness peaked at 3B parameters and declined again at 11B parameters, which is counterintuitive.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of recent generative retrieval methods on large-scale corpora. It highlights the importance of synthetic queries and compute-efficient techniques, while showing that naively scaling up model size does not consistently improve effectiveness. The findings help clarify the state of generative retrieval and reveal open challenges to make it competitive with dual encoders at scale.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper empirically studies different generative retrieval techniques, finding that synthetic query generation is crucial for effectiveness but scaling these models to millions of passages remains an open challenge.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in generative retrieval:

- Scale of Evaluation: This paper evaluates generative retrieval techniques at an unprecedented scale, using the full MS MARCO passage corpus of 8.8 million passages. Most prior work evaluated on much smaller datasets like Natural Questions or TriviaQA. Evaluating at this scale provides unique insights.

- Focus on Ablations: The paper systematically ablates various techniques like synthetic queries, document identifiers, and model components proposed in recent generative retrieval papers. This provides clarity on what works at smaller vs. larger scale. Prior work tended to focus on proposing new methods.

- Model Scaling: The paper investigates how model scaling impacts effectiveness, testing up to 11B parameters. This analysis is unique and shows diminishing returns to scaling for sequential identifiers. 

- Retrieval Benchmarks: The paper uses MS MARCO passage ranking as the main benchmark. This is one of the most widely used academic IR benchmarks. Some prior generative retrieval work used proprietary or less common benchmarks.

- Comparison to Dual Encoders: The paper directly compares to state-of-the-art dual encoders like GTR showing the remaining gap, especially at scale. Comparisons help contextualize progress.

Overall, the large-scale analysis, ablation studies, and model scaling experiments provide unique insights compared to prior work. The paper focuses on analyzing the current state and challenges of generative retrieval through comprehensive experiments rather than proposing new techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the "Future Directions" section:

1. They highlight that open problems in generative retrieval remain, such as achieving state-of-the-art results on large corpora and enabling updates to the model with new documents.

2. They raise new open questions based on their findings: 

- How to properly leverage large language models to benefit generative retrieval on large corpora, since simply scaling up model size did not consistently improve results in their experiments. 

- How to design scaling recipes and derive scaling laws to maximize retrieval performance, since default T5 scaling may not be optimal.

- How to design architectures that balance the compute trade-offs between atomic IDs and sequential IDs.

3. They suggest investigating the maximum corpus size where generative retrieval could provide state-of-the-art performance as an important question for future work. Their work focused on effectiveness at large scale but did not address when generative becomes non-competitive.

4. They recommend continued research into fundamental improvements to the generative retrieval paradigm before the power of large language models can be fully leveraged.

In summary, the main future directions are: solving remaining open problems, investigating proper model scaling, balancing compute trade-offs, determining maximum effective corpus size, and improving the core retrieval paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents the first empirical study of generative retrieval techniques over the full 8.8 million passage MS MARCO corpus. It evaluates popular approaches from recent works like Differentiable Search Indexes, Bridging Indexing and Retrieval with Generative Models, and Neural Corpus Indexer on smaller datasets before scaling up to MS MARCO. The key findings are: 1) Synthetic query generation is the single most important technique as corpus size increases, with training just on synthetic queries to naive IDs being most effective. 2) When accounting for compute costs, apparent quality improvements from sophisticated modeling techniques vanish. Simply scaling up the naive approach achieves similar results. 3) Increasing model scale improves effectiveness, but peaks at 3B parameters for sequential IDs, with further scaling to 11B slightly hurting results. The paper concludes that while promising on small datasets, scaling generative retrieval to millions of passages remains an open challenge needing continued research and likely more fundamental advances.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper conducts the first empirical study of generative retrieval techniques over the full MS MARCO passage ranking task, evaluating effectiveness over 8.8M passages. The authors select popular approaches from recent literature and evaluate them on smaller datasets like Natural Questions and TriviaQA to establish an ablation study. They then scale up experiments to the MS MARCO dataset, beginning with a 100K subset before increasing to 1M and finally 8.8M passages. This allows them to determine which techniques remain effective at scale. Finally, they explore scaling model size for the best sequential ID approach up to 11B parameters and compare to Atomic IDs. 

The paper finds that of all techniques considered, using synthetic queries as document representations is the single most critical component as corpus size grows. Simply scaling a model trained on synthetic queries to Naïve ID generation is the most effective approach. While generative retrieval is competitive on small datasets, scaling to millions of passages remains a challenge. The findings suggest continued research is needed into scaling laws and model architectures before the power of large language models can be leveraged for generative retrieval. Overall, the work provides valuable insights into the state of generative retrieval and highlights unique challenges when applying it to large corpora.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a generative retrieval approach based on a Transformer sequence-to-sequence model. The model is trained to generate document identifiers given either the document content (indexing task) or a relevant query (retrieval task). At inference time, the model takes a query as input and generates a ranked list of document identifiers as output. The key aspect of the method is using synthetic queries generated by doc2query models as the input representations for documents during training. This is shown to be crucial for good performance compared to using the document content directly. The paper evaluates different techniques for generating document identifiers as well as architectural modifications proposed in prior work. Experiments are conducted on datasets of increasing scale up to the full MS MARCO corpus, showing the importance of synthetic queries and limitations of other techniques at scale. The main conclusion is that scaling up generative retrieval effectively remains an open challenge.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and questions addressed in the paper are:

- The paper is investigating the effectiveness of generative retrieval techniques, which aim to replace traditional information retrieval pipelines with a single sequence-to-sequence model. 

- Prior work has proposed various techniques to improve generative retrieval, but only evaluated them on small datasets (around 100k documents). The key question is how well do these techniques work when scaled up to millions of documents.

- Specifically, the paper examines techniques like using synthetic queries, different document identifier representations (atomic, naive, semantic), and modeling components like PAWA decoder and consistency loss. It aims to understand which of these are most important for scaling up.

- The paper notes that no prior work has studied or evaluated generative retrieval at the scale of millions of documents, which is an important practical setting. Evaluating on the full MS MARCO dataset with 8.8 million passages is a key contribution.

- Broader goals are to clarify the current effectiveness of generative retrieval techniques, understand the unique challenges compared to small scale, and provide findings to inspire new research directions to advance generative retrieval to be competitive at scale against dual encoders.

In summary, the key problem is understanding how well generative retrieval techniques perform at scale, and ablating proposed methods from prior work to determine which aspects are most important when scaling up to millions of documents. Evaluating generative retrieval on the full MS MARCO dataset is a novel contribution.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using synthetic queries generated by doc2query models as document representations during training. Why do you think this is more effective than using the actual document content? How does it help mitigate the gaps between indexing and retrieval tasks?

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first empirical study of generative retrieval techniques scaled up to millions of passages using the MS MARCO dataset. The authors find that synthetic query generation is the most critical technique for effectiveness at scale, while other proposed methods like semantic identifiers and architecture modifications become less useful. They show that simply training T5 to map synthetic queries to naive string identifiers is the most effective approach as corpus size grows. Surprisingly, model scaling provides diminishing returns - a 3B parameter T5-XL model achieves the best result of 26.7 MRR@10 on the full MS MARCO dataset, while further scaling to 11B parameters hurts performance. The results suggest generative retrieval still faces challenges scaling to millions of passages and large language models, highlighting the need for continued research to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art dense retrieval models. Key findings include the central role of synthetic queries, reduced value of proposed techniques at scale, surprising model scaling limits, and that achieving strong retrieval at scale remains an open problem for generative retrieval.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides the first empirical study of generative retrieval techniques on the large-scale MS MARCO passage ranking task with a corpus of 8.8M passages. The authors evaluate various techniques from recent works including synthetic query generation, document identifier designs, and model architecture modifications. They find synthetic queries to be the single most important method, with other sophisticated techniques not providing benefits at scale. Simply training T5 models to map synthetic queries to sequential naive IDs was most effective, with performance peaking at 26.7 MRR@10 using a 3B parameter T5-XL model. However, further scaling to 11B parameters surprisingly hurt performance. While competitive at small scales, scaling generative retrieval to millions of documents remains an open challenge. The results indicate more research is needed into techniques tailored for large corpora and better leveraging model scaling before the paradigm can achieve state-of-the-art on passage ranking.
