# [Subgoal Discovery for Hierarchical Dialogue Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07855)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to automatically discover useful subgoals for training dialogue agents on complex tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes a method to:

- Automatically segment dialogue sessions into subtasks/subgoals without human labeling. This is done using an unsupervised sequence segmentation model called the Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN).

- Use the discovered subgoals to train a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) agent for dialogue policy optimization. The HRL agent has a high-level policy for selecting subgoals and low-level policies for executing actions to complete subgoals. 

The key hypothesis is that with automatically discovered subgoals, the HRL agent can learn dialogue policies for complex tasks more efficiently than flat RL agents trained from scratch. Subgoals help mitigate sparse rewards and exploration challenges in long conversations for complex tasks.

The paper validates this hypothesis through simulated and human evaluations on a composite travel planning task. Results show the HRL agent with discovered subgoals performs competitively to one with human-defined subgoals, and better than a flat RL agent without subgoal discovery. The discovered subgoals are also found to be human interpretable.

In summary, the paper focuses on automatic subgoal discovery to enable more effective hierarchical RL for training dialogue agents on complex tasks, without requiring manual subgoal annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a method to automatically discover useful subgoals for hierarchical reinforcement learning of dialogue policies, called the Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN). 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- The SDN takes as input successful example dialogues, and identifies "hub" states that tend to occur frequently on successful paths but not unsuccessful ones. These hub states are identified as subgoals.

- Given the discovered subgoals, hierarchical RL can be used to learn a policy with two levels: a top-level policy that selects among subgoals, and a lower-level policy that executes actions to achieve the selected subgoal. 

- They demonstrate this approach on a travel planning dialogue task, showing that an RL agent using automatically discovered subgoals can perform competitively to one using human-defined subgoals, and much better than an agent without subgoals.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a method to automatically identify useful subgoals from example dialogues, which enables using hierarchical RL to learn good dialogue policies without requiring manual subgoal specification. This could make it much easier to apply hierarchical RL successfully to complex dialogue tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to automatically discover useful subgoals from example dialogues and use them to learn hierarchical dialogue policies more efficiently using reinforcement learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses on using reinforcement learning to develop dialogue agents for complex goal-oriented tasks like travel planning. Much prior work has focused on simpler tasks like scheduling meetings or making calls. So this paper tackles more complex and realistic problems.

- The key innovation is using hierarchical reinforcement learning along with automatically discovered subgoals to handle the complexity. Many prior RL dialogue systems use "flat" policies without hierarchy. And hierarchical RL papers generally rely on human-defined subgoals. Automatically discovering useful subgoals is novel.

- For subgoal discovery, the paper proposes a new unsupervised sequence segmentation model called the Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN). This is a novel architecture designed for this problem. It's not something that has been explored before for dialogue.

- Experiments compare against strong baselines including a rule-based system, flat RL, and hierarchical RL with human subgoals. The proposed method performs competitively, demonstrating its usefulness.

- The proposed agent is evaluated on a travel planning task using both a user simulator and real users. Many RL dialogue papers only report simulator results. Testing on humans makes the results stronger.

- The paper includes analysis and visualization of the learned subgoals, showing they are human interpretable. Understanding what the model has learned is an important part of the evaluation.

So in summary, this paper pushes on several fronts - tackling more complex tasks, using hierarchy and learned subgoals for RL dialogues, proposing a new model tailored for subgoal discovery, and rigorous evaluation including humans. The results advance the state-of-the-art in developing goal-oriented conversational agents.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Integrate subgoal discovery into dialogue policy learning rather than treat them as separate processes. The current approach runs subgoal discovery first on demonstration data, then does policy learning. The authors suggest combining these steps could be more effective.

- Extend the Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN) to identify multi-level hierarchical structures among subgoals. This could allow handling more complex tasks than the single-level subgoal structure used in this work. 

- Generalize the SDN approach to other complex goal-oriented tasks beyond dialogue, such as challenging games like Montezuma's Revenge that have sparse rewards and could benefit from discovering useful subgoals.

- Improve the stability and coherence of the learned policy when using the probabilistic subgoal termination approach. The variance of the current thresholding approach sometimes leads to unnatural behavior.

- Evaluate the approach on simpler single-domain dialogue tasks to see if it can discover meaningful substructure even in those settings. The current experiments are all on a complex composite dialogue task.

- Study how the number and quality of demonstration dialogues impacts the subgoals discovered and downstream policy learning. More analysis is needed on these factors.

In summary, the main directions are developing more integrated subgoal discovery and policy learning, scaling up to more complex tasks and environments, and better understanding the properties and tradeoffs of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a method to automatically discover useful subgoals for training hierarchical dialogue agents. The key ideas are: 1) They develop a Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN) which takes as input successful conversational examples and identifies "hub" states that occur frequently in successful episodes but rarely in failures; these hub states are identified as subgoals. 2) Given the discovered subgoals, they use hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to learn a dialogue policy which has a top-level policy to choose subgoals and low-level policies to take primitive actions to accomplish subgoals. They apply this to a composite task dialogue system for travel planning. 3) Experiments with both simulated and real users show the agent trained with discovered subgoals performs comparably to one trained with human-defined subgoals, and much better than a flat dialogue agent without subgoals. The discovered subgoals are often human interpretable.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a method to automatically discover useful subgoals for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) of dialogue agents for complex tasks. It proposes the Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN) which takes as input successful example dialogues and identifies "hub" states as subgoals. A hub state is one that is visited frequently on successful dialogue paths but not unsuccessful ones. Given discovered subgoals, HRL can be applied to learn a hierarchical policy - a top level policy selects among subgoals and a lower level policy chooses actions to achieve subgoals. 

The approach is demonstrated through experiments on a travel planning dialogue agent, using both simulated and real users. Results show the agent learned with automatic subgoal discovery performs competitively to one with human-defined subgoals, and better than without subgoals. The learned subgoals are also found to often be human comprehensible. The work is significant in enabling automated learning of dialogue agents for complex tasks where the subtask structure may not be known a priori.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for automatically discovering useful subgoals for hierarchical reinforcement learning of dialogue policies for complex tasks. The key ideas are:

1. They propose a Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN) that takes as input a collection of successful dialogue sessions and identifies "hub" states as subgoals. Intuitively, a hub state is one that the agent tends to visit frequently on successful paths to the goal, but not on unsuccessful paths. 

2. The SDN models the likelihood of a dialogue trajectory by considering all possible segmentations into subgoals. It uses two RNNs to model transitions within and between segments. The model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of observed successful dialogues in an unsupervised manner.

3. Given the subgoals discovered by the SDN, they use hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to learn a dialogue policy. The policy consists of a high-level policy that chooses among subgoals and low-level policies that take actions to achieve subgoals. 

4. They use a combination of extrinsic rewards (for task completion) and intrinsic rewards (for subgoal achievement) to train the hierarchical policy using Q-learning.

In summary, the key novelty is the unsupervised SDN for discovering useful subgoals from successful dialogues, which are then exploited by HRL to efficiently learn a policy for complex dialogue tasks. Experiments on a travel planning domain show this approach can match or exceed a hierarchical policy based on human-defined subgoals.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of developing dialogue agents to engage in complex goal-oriented dialogues. Specifically, it focuses on the challenges that arise due to the sparseness of reward signals in long conversations where the dialogue policy needs to explore a large state-action space. 

The key question the paper tries to address is - how can we discover and exploit the hidden structure of complex dialogue tasks to enable more efficient policy learning?

The paper proposes a divide-and-conquer approach to address this question, by automatically discovering simpler subgoals that can be used to learn a hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning.

Some of the key points:

- Complex dialogues like travel planning consist of multiple subtasks (e.g. booking flights, hotels). The main signals (rewards) are very sparse in long conversations.

- The paper proposes the Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN) to automatically identify "hub" states as subgoals from example successful dialogues.

- Identified subgoals are used to learn a hierarchical policy with (1) a top-level policy to select subgoals (2) lower-level policies to complete subgoals.

- Experiments on travel planning with simulated and real users show the approach is competitive to using human-defined subgoals, and much better than no subgoals.

- The discovered subgoals are often human comprehensible.

In summary, the paper tries to address the challenge of sparse rewards and large action spaces in complex dialogues, by using automatic subgoal discovery to enable more efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning of policies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) - The paper focuses on using HRL to learn dialogue policies for complex tasks. HRL involves learning policies at multiple levels - a high-level policy for selecting subgoals and low-level policies to complete subgoals.

- Subgoal discovery - A key contribution of the paper is automatically discovering useful subgoals from example dialogues, rather than relying on human-defined subgoals. This is done using the proposed Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN).

- Options framework - The hierarchy in HRL is formulated using the options framework, where subgoals are options (temporally extended actions). Options have initiation sets, policies, and termination conditions.

- State trajectory segmentation - Subgoal discovery is framed as a state trajectory segmentation problem. Subgoals correspond to "hub" states that are visited frequently on successful trajectories.

- Unsupervised learning - The SDN is trained in an unsupervised manner to discover subgoals, using maximum likelihood optimization on example successful dialogues.

- Task-oriented dialogues - The techniques are applied to complex goal-oriented or task-oriented dialogues, like travel planning, which require satisfying constraints across multiple subtasks.

- User simulator - An agenda-based user simulator is used to provide a learning environment and reward signal during training.

- Evaluation - Both simulated and real users are used to evaluate the agents. The automatically discovered subgoals lead to strong performance.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a divide-and-conquer approach to learn hierarchical dialogue policies for complex goal-oriented tasks. The key idea is to first automatically discover useful subgoals in an unsupervised manner from successful example dialogues using a proposed Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN). SDN identifies "hub" states that are visited frequently on successful paths but rarely on unsuccessful ones as subgoals. These discovered subgoals are then used by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a multi-level policy consisting of a high-level policy that selects subgoals and a low-level policy that takes primitive actions to accomplish subgoals. Experiments on a travel planning task with simulated and real users show that the agent learned with discovered subgoals performs competitively to one with human-defined subgoals and outperforms a flat policy without subgoals. The subgoals discovered by SDN are also found to be human-interpretable. Overall, this work provides a way to automate subgoal discovery to enable efficient hierarchical policy learning for dialogue agents.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel divide-and-conquer approach for hierarchical dialogue policy learning that automatically discovers useful subgoals in an unsupervised manner. The key idea is to leverage successful dialogue examples to identify "hub" states that are frequently visited on successful trajectories but rarely visited on failed ones. These hub states represent subgoals that can decompose a complex dialogue task into simpler sub-problems. Specifically, the authors develop a Subgoal Discovery Network (SDN) to segment dialogue trajectories into subgoals by modeling sequence likelihoods. The discovered subgoals are then used by a hierarchical reinforcement learning agent to learn dialogue policies more efficiently, with a high-level policy choosing subgoals and a low-level policy taking actions to satisfy subgoals. Experiments on a travel planning scenario with simulated and real users show the agent with discovered subgoals performs on par with using expert-defined subgoals and much better than no subgoals. The subgoals are also found to be human interpretable. Overall, this is a novel approach for automating subgoal discovery to enable more scalable hierarchical dialogue policy learning on complex tasks. Key strengths are the unsupervised subgoal discovery and demonstration of strong empirical results.
