# [VidLanKD: Improving Language Understanding via Video-Distilled Knowledge   Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02681)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that visually-grounded multi-modal knowledge from videos can improve language understanding, beyond what is possible with text-only pretraining. Specifically, the authors propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation method called VidLanKD to transfer knowledge from a video-text pretrained teacher model to a student text-only language model. The key ideas are:

1) Videos provide richer grounded world knowledge compared to images, especially action-based and physical commonsense knowledge.

2) A large-scale video dataset like HowTo100M has more diverse vocabulary and examples compared to typical image-text datasets. 

3) Using different knowledge distillation objectives like NST and CRD can avoid the approximation error of assigning finite image/video "vokens" to tokens.

4) Transferring knowledge from a multi-modal teacher to a text-only student maintains the scalability of standard language model pretraining.

The central hypothesis is that by distilling knowledge from a teacher model pretrained on diverse video-text data, the student language model can gain improved language understanding abilities, even without seeing any visual input. The authors evaluate this through extensive experiments on language understanding benchmarks like GLUE, SQuAD, SWAG etc.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that grounding language learning on large-scale, diverse video data can provide benefits for general natural language understanding, by transferring visual knowledge to text-only models. The proposed VidLanKD method aims to effectively distill this visually-grounded knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing VidLanKD, a novel video-language knowledge distillation method to improve language understanding. The key idea is to first pretrain a teacher model on a large-scale video-text dataset, then transfer its knowledge to a student language model on a text dataset via new distillation objectives.

2. Using a large-scale video dataset (HowTo100M) which provides diverse vocabulary and rich world knowledge compared to image datasets commonly used in prior works. The video grounding helps the model learn better physical and temporal reasoning.

3. Proposing to use Neuron Selectivity Transfer (NST) and Contrastive Representation Distillation (CRD) objectives for knowledge transfer, which avoid the approximation error of using a fixed set of image/video labels (vokens) as in prior work.

4. Empirical improvements over strong baselines like BERT and vokenization on several language understanding tasks including GLUE, SQuAD, SWAG. Detailed ablation studies are provided.

5. Analysis of the improved linguistic knowledge and physical/temporal reasoning abilities learned from video grounding, using GLUE-diagnostics, PIQA, and TRACIE datasets. Text-to-video retrieval visualization further shows the learned grounding.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a way to effectively transfer visual knowledge from large-scale video data to improve language understanding, via a new cross-modal knowledge distillation method and objectives. Both empirical and analysis results demonstrate the benefits of the video grounding.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VidLanKD, a novel video-language knowledge distillation method to improve language understanding by first pretraining a teacher model on a video-text dataset using contrastive learning and masked language modeling objectives, then transferring its knowledge to a student language model on a text dataset using neuron selectivity transfer and contrastive representation distillation objectives.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on visually grounded language learning:

- It proposes a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation method, VidLanKD, for transferring knowledge from a multi-modal teacher model (video + text) to a student language model (text only). This is a new approach compared to prior works like vokenization that directly supervise the language model with vision labels.

- It experiments with different knowledge distillation objectives like NST and CRD to avoid the approximation error issue suffered by vokenization. The objectives better transfer the contextual representations.

- It demonstrates strong performance improvements on diverse NLU tasks like GLUE, SQuAD, SWAG over text-only models and vokenization models.

- It provides extensive ablation studies and analysis to understand where the improvements are coming from - whether it's the video grounding, knowledge distillation objectives, or architectures. 

- It analyzes the acquired knowledge qualitatively by showing improved commonsense reasoning on datasets like PIQA and TRACIE. It also visualizes the learned grounding through text-video retrieval.

In summary, this paper makes significant advances over prior visually-grounded language learning methods by using videos, exploring new cross-modal distillation methods, and comprehensive empirical analysis. The gains on multiple language understanding benchmarks highlight the promise of this research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring different knowledge distillation objectives beyond the ones studied in this work. The authors found NST and CRD to work well, but think there may be even better objectives for cross-modal distillation.

- Studying the effect of different teacher architectures, such as using different numbers of layers or attention heads. The authors used standard BERT architecture, but think variations may further improve knowledge transfer. 

- Evaluating on a broader set of downstream tasks beyond GLUE, SQuAD and SWAG. The authors would like to analyze the effectiveness on tasks like reading comprehension, open-domain QA, sentiment analysis, etc.

- Training and evaluating multilingual models to study cross-lingual knowledge transfer from videos. The authors currently only experimented with English text.

- Analyzing what makes an effective student architecture for absorbing visually-grounded knowledge. The authors used a standard BERT student model, but think custom architectures may work better.

- Conducting further analysis into what linguistic and physical knowledge is learned from videos, beyond the initial analysis done in the paper.

- Scaling up the video dataset size for pretraining the teacher model to learn from even more diverse videos.

- Exploring alternate student training schemes like adversarial learning or reinforcement learning.

In summary, the main future directions are around exploring new objectives, architectures, tasks, languages, analysis methods, datasets, and student training techniques for improving video-distilled knowledge transfer to language models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel video-and-language knowledge distillation method called VidLanKD to improve language understanding. The key idea is to transfer knowledge from a teacher multi-modal model trained on aligned video-text data to a student text-only model. 

The teacher model consists of a video encoder and a language encoder based on transformers. It is pretrained on the HowTo100M video dataset using two objectives - a video-language contrastive loss to align video and text representations, and a masked language modeling loss on the text. 

After pretraining the teacher, its knowledge is transferred to the student language model on a large text corpus (Wikipedia) using proposed distillation objectives - neuron selectivity transfer (NST) and contrastive representation distillation (CRD). This allows the student model to learn rich grounded knowledge from videos without seeing any visual input during its training.

Experiments show VidLanKD student models outperform text-only baselines on GLUE, SQuAD and SWAG benchmarks. Analyses also demonstrate improved commonsense reasoning and text-video grounding abilities. Overall, the paper presents an effective knowledge distillation approach to incorporate visual knowledge into language models.
