# [Multi-Granularity Guided Fusion-in-Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02581)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In open-domain question answering (ODQA), it is challenging to discern relevant contexts as evidence from retrieved results and avoid selecting spurious contexts that may lead to incorrect answers. 
- Existing fusion-in-decoder (FiD) models that encode and concatenate multiple passages struggle to handle spurious passages. Relying solely on answer spans or passage-level evidentiality is insufficient.
- There is a need to discern evidence at multiple levels of granularity - both passage-level and sentence-level.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Multi-Granularity Guided Fusion-in-Decoder (MGFiD) that incorporates multi-task learning to discern evidence across passages (coarse-grained) and sentences (fine-grained).
- It employs passage re-ranking and sentence classification as auxiliary tasks. Re-ranking highlights relevant passages while sentence classification focuses on key sentences.  
- It generates an "anchor vector" from positively predicted sentences to provide a rationale signal to the decoder.
- It leverages passage re-ranking probabilities for threshold-based pruning of irrelevant passages to improve efficiency.
- It uses large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels for passage re-ranking task.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces evidentiality of FiD model using multi-granularity contexts - passages and sentences
- Utilizes LLMs to generate pseudo-labels for passage re-ranking
- Reuses outcomes of multi-task learning (anchor vector and passage probabilities) to improve accuracy and efficiency of decoder
- Experiments show MGFiD outperforms FiD baselines on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating benefits of discerning multi-granular evidence


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a Multi-Granularity Guided Fusion-in-Decoder (MGFiD) model that improves open-domain question answering by discerning evidence across multiple levels of granularity through multi-task learning of passage re-ranking and sentence classification, and utilizing the outcomes to enhance both efficiency and effectiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It introduces the evidentiality of the Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) using multi-granularity contexts, i.e. both passage-level and sentence-level contexts, to help the model better discern supporting evidence. 

2) It utilizes large language models to generate pseudo-labels for supportive passages in the open-domain question answering task.

3) It reuses the outcomes of the multi-granularity evidentiality tasks - an anchor vector from sentence classification and threshold-based masking from passage ranking - to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of the answer generation process.

4) Through experiments on two benchmark datasets, it shows that the proposed model, Multi-Granularity Guided Fusion-in-Decoder (MGFiD), improves over the original FiD and other baseline models by better discerning multi-granular evidence.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel reader model called MGFiD that incorporates multi-granularity evidence discernment and reuses the outcomes to enhance accuracy and efficiency in open-domain question answering.

The paper proposes a new model called MGFiD that improves upon the FiD architecture for open-domain question answering. It incorporates multi-task learning at multiple levels of granularity (passages and sentences) to help discern supportive evidence and guide answer generation. Key ideas include using LLMs to generate pseudo-labels, an anchor vector to initialize the decoder, and threshold-based pruning to improve efficiency. The goal is to aggregate relevant multi-granularity contexts while avoiding being misled by spurious passages or sentences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the proposed MGFiD model incorporate multi-granularity context to improve answer generation? What are the different levels of granularity used and why?

2. The paper argues that relying solely on answer spans or passage-level evidentiality is insufficient. Why? And how does incorporating sentence-level evidence help address this issue?

3. The anchor vector helps couple the multi-task learning with answer generation. How is the anchor vector constructed? And specifically how does it provide a rationale signal to the decoder? 

4. Explain in detail how the passage re-ranking and sentence classification tasks are formulated, including the loss functions used. How do they complement each other within the multi-task learning framework?

5. Why does MGFiD leverage Large Language Models for generating pseudo-labels of supportive passages? What are the benefits over using answer span based labels?

6. The paper mentions the computational bottleneck caused by the intensive key-value matrix in the FiD decoder. How does MGFiD's threshold-based passage pruning strategy address this issue?

7. Analyze the experimental results and ablation studies - which components of MGFiD contribute most to the performance improvements observed? Are the gains consistent across datasets?

8. What different metrics are used to evaluate the performance of MGFiD's components for ranking, classification and question answering? What do these metrics reveal about the model's capabilities?  

9. Explain what Figure 2 illustrates regarding the limitations of using passage-level evidence. Could incorporating sentence classification help address such cases?

10. The paper mentions some limitations of the proposed approach. What are these? And what potential future work directions could address them?
