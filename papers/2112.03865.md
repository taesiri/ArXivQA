# [Universalizing Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03865)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop a universal weak supervision technique that works for any type of label (e.g. rankings, regression values, parse trees, etc.) while still providing desirable properties like computational efficiency and statistical guarantees?The key hypothesis appears to be that by embedding arbitrary label types into Boolean or Euclidean spaces, learning an exponential family label model, and performing inference, it is possible to obtain a flexible yet principled weak supervision framework. The authors hypothesize that this approach will enable weak supervision for new tasks and provide benefits like improved performance over baselines as the number/quality of sources increases.In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates a universal weak supervision technique meant to work across diverse label types while maintaining desirable properties, in order to overcome limitations of current weak supervision methods that are tailored to specific label types like binary classification.
