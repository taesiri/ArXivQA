# [Expressive Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for whole-body control of humanoid robots produce motions that lack expressiveness and grace compared to actual human motions. 
- Directly transferring state-of-the-art physics-based character animation methods from graphics to real robots is challenging due to differences in degrees of freedom and physical capabilities.

Proposed Method (ExBody):
- Leverage large-scale human motion capture datasets and deep reinforcement learning to enable rich and diverse whole-body motions on a humanoid robot.  
- Relax the motion imitation constraints on the legs and focus on matching the upper body to the human motions. The legs mainly follow specified velocity commands to enable robust locomotion.  
- Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world comparisons validate the method's ability to produce expressive and reactive motions while maintaining locomotion capabilities.

Key Contributions:
- A goal-conditioned policy that takes in both a human motion clip and desired robot velocity/pose commands as input.
- Strategies to curate, retarget and utilize human mocap data to guide policy learning in an RL framework. 
- ExBody method that relaxes leg tracking constraints allowing more expressive arm motions while ensuring locomotion robustness.
- State-of-the-art results for reactive and rich whole-body control on a real humanoid robot (shown dancing, gesturing and interacting with a human).
- Extensive simulated and real-world experiments analyzing design choices and comparing to alternative methods.

In summary, the paper enables more human-like whole-body motions on legged robots by learning from and properly utilizing large-scale human motion capture data.
