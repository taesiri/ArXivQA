# [Factor-Assisted Federated Learning for Personalized Optimization with   Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04281)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel federated learning approach called FedSplit to address the challenge of statistical data heterogeneity across clients. The key idea is to decompose the hidden elements (neurons or channels) within each layer of the neural network into client-shared and client-specific groups. The former captures common knowledge and is updated collectively across clients, while the latter captures personalized knowledge and is updated locally. To enable this decomposition in practice, the paper develops a method called FedFac that utilizes factor analysis to discriminate between the two types of elements. Extensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that FedFac converges faster and achieves higher test accuracy than state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms. The paper also provides theoretical analysis to show the linear convergence rate and generalization guarantees of the proposed approach. Overall, by explicitly modeling and incorporating both shared and personalized knowledge during training, FedFac advances the capability of federated learning in tackling heterogeneous data distributions.
