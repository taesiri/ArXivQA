# [Link Prediction for Social Networks using Representation Learning and   Heuristic-based Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08613)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of link prediction in social networks. Link prediction refers to predicting whether a relationship or edge can exist between two nodes (users) in a network. Accurate link prediction has applications in areas like recommendations and influence analysis. The key challenge lies in effectively representing the nodes and edges in the network to enable predictive modeling.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper explores and compares multiple methods to generate node and edge representations, categorized into - structural embeddings, neighborhood-based embeddings, graph neural networks (GNNs), and heuristic features. It then uses these representations to formulate link prediction as a binary classification problem. Ensemble classifiers like XGBoost and custom neural networks are employed for classification.

The core proposal is combining heuristic features with learned representations from GNNs, to improve prediction performance over using either category alone. This is implemented by concatenating the heuristic (H) and representation (R) feature vectors into a combined set (H,R).

Key Contributions:

- Comprehensive analysis of 10 feature extraction techniques for link prediction using ensemble classifiers 

- Exploration of combining heuristic and neural representation features, showing improved performance over individual techniques

- Introduction of custom deep neural network architectures that outperform ensemble classifiers for certain datasets

- Experimentation over 10 datasets exhibiting different network properties to demonstrate generalizability

- Revelation that while heuristics alone work best individually, combinations with GNN-based features like GraphSAGE and Watch YourStep yield slight improvements

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights into fusing explainable engineered features with complex learned representations for predicting links in social networks. The findings motivate further research into optimal combination techniques.
