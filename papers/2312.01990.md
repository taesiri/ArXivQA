# [SARA-RT: Scaling up Robotics Transformers with Self-Adaptive Robust   Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01990)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces Self-Adaptive Robust Attention for Robotics Transformers (SARA-RT), a new method to adapt pre-trained Transformer-based robotic controllers to more efficient linear attention variants that can be deployed on robots. The key idea is "up-training" - fine-tuning the linear attention variants to match the original softmax attention. This allows converting quadratic attention Transformers into linear ones while maintaining performance. The authors demonstrate SARA-RT on two robotics use cases: (1) Point Cloud Transformers for grasping, where it speeds up inference by making attention constant time instead of bottlenecked on point cloud size, and (2) RT-2, a recent billion-parameter vision-language-action model where SARA-RT provides 14% faster inference without losing accuracy. The authors complement the empirical validation with mathematical analysis giving insight into why SARA-RT works. Overall, SARA-RT takes a step towards addressing the practical challenges of deploying large Transformer models on robots by making their attention mechanisms more efficient.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SARA-RT: Scaling up Robotics Transformers with Self-Adaptive Robust Attention":

Problem:
- Robotics Transformers (RTs) have led to breakthroughs in robotic control, reasoning and generalization. However, they have prohibitively expensive quadratic space and time complexity, making deployment on real robots challenging.  
- For example, the 35M parameter RT-1 model operates at only 3Hz. Larger billion parameter models like RT-2 are even more problematic.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Self-Adaptive Robust Attention (SARA-RT), a new paradigm to convert quadratic attention in RTs to efficient linear attention, while maintaining performance.
- SARA-RT relies on a new up-training method to fine-tune the linear attention variant using the original RT as initialization.  

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate SARA-RT to speed up recently introduced RT-2, the first internet-scale pre-trained Vision-Language-Action robot policy.
- Apply SARA-RT to Point Cloud Transformer policies operating on large point clouds for grasping.
- Provide mathematical analysis giving insight into why SARA-RT works effectively.
- Show 14% speedup for RT-2 while maintaining accuracy across manipulation tasks. Enable use of longer history and higher resolution images.
- Show constant 100ms inference for SARA point cloud policies regardless of points, vs slowdowns for regular policies.
- Propose SARA-RT as a first step towards addressing deployment challenges of Transformer policies.

In summary, the paper addresses quadratic complexity issues of Robotics Transformers via Self-Adaptive Robust Attention and demonstrates its effectiveness analytically and empirically on large language models and point cloud inputs for real robotic control.
