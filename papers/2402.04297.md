# [Road Surface Defect Detection -- From Image-based to Non-image-based: A   Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04297)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper documents Elsevier's CAS LaTeX template for typesetting journal articles. The template is designed for journals that use Elsevier's updated workflow. There are two class files provided - cas-sc.cls for single column layout and cas-dc.cls for double column layout.

The paper first introduces the usage of the class files and the available options. Then it discusses the front matter in detail, covering the following elements:

Title - options for specifying alternate, sub, translated titles etc.

Authors - several options for specifying author details like id, role, social media accounts, etc.

Marks in front matter - methods for specifying title marks, author marks, footnote marks, corresponding author marks.

Abstract and keywords.

The main matter is also briefly covered, including tables, figures, theorem-like environments and lists. Special attention is given to a new proof environment for custom proofs.

Next, the biography section shows how to include author photos and bios. This is followed by a section on the CRediT taxonomy for author contributions.

Finally, the bibliography section recommends two reference models - model1-num-names.bst and cas-model2-names.bst for numeric and author-year styles respectively.

In summary, the template provides many useful options and commands to customize the layout, formatting and metadata of manuscripts for CAS journals. The documentation serves as a handy reference for authors, editors and typesetters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content, it seems the main contribution of this paper is to provide documentation and instructions on using the CAS LaTeX templates (cas-sc.cls and cas-dc.cls) for typesetting journal articles to be submitted to Elsevier journals. Specifically, it covers:

- Usage of the CAS templates
- Formatting various parts of the front matter, including title, authors, abstract, keywords
- Formatting main text elements like sections, figures, tables, theorems 
- Handling bibliographies
- Including author biography and authorship contribution statements

The paper serves as a user guide and reference for researchers to properly format their LaTeX manuscripts for submission to Elsevier CAS journals using these templates. It does not present any new research contributions of its own.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper discusses two recommended reference models for CAS categories - model1-num-names.bst and cas-model2-names.bst. Could you explain in more detail the key differences between these two reference models and when one might be preferred over the other? 

2) When using the cas-dc.cls classfile for a double column layout, what specific challenges have you encountered when dealing with longer abstracts that span more than one page? How were you able to resolve this?

3) Could you provide some examples of custom proof environments you have created without counters using the \newproof command? What are some specific use cases where a custom proof environment would be preferred?

4) The paper mentions extended list processing macros that make the usage more user friendly compared to default LaTeX list macros. Could you provide some specific examples comparing the extended macros to default LaTeX macros for enumerated and itemized lists?

5) What have been some common issues you have faced when dealing with special symbols, accents, or non-English characters using the CAS templates? How were you able to resolve them? 

6) Have you customized or created your own BibTeX styles based on the recommended model1-num-names.bst and cas-model2-names.bst files? What modifications did you need to make?

7) The template supports specifying author ORCID identifiers. Have you run into any challenges getting ORCID adoption among authors or properly formatting/displaying ORCIDs? 

8) Figures and tables can span multiple columns using the figure* and table* environments. What are some best practices you recommend for handling these wide elements?

9) Mathematics can be formatted in multiple ways. Have you encountered any issues with getting certain math typography (such as multi-line equations) properly formatted? How did you resolve it?

10) The front matter can contain various author notes and marks to the title using commands like \tnotetext and \fntext. Have you run into cases where these notes overflow into the abstract or other areas? How do you prevent this layout issue?
