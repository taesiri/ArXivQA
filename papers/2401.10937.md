# [Subjective Causality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Subjective Causality":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of understanding and identifying a decision maker's subjective causal judgments by observing their preferences over interventions. Specifically, the goal is to represent a decision maker's preferences in terms of a causal model, probability distribution, and utility function. 

Background: 
The paper represents causality using causal models, also called structural equations models, where the world is described by variables related by equations. Variables are split into exogenous (determined by factors outside the model) and endogenous (determined by exogenous variables and other endogenous variables). The paper allows conditional interventions using "if-then-else" statements. The decision maker has a preference relation over possible interventions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper shows that if the preference relation satisfies certain reasonable axioms, then there exists a causal model, probability on contexts (settings of exogenous variables), and utility on outcomes (settings of all variables) that represent the preferences. Specifically, the decision maker prefers intervention A to B iff the expected utility of A is greater than that of B. The causal model and probability capture the decision maker's beliefs, while the utility captures their preferences.  

Main Contributions:
- Provides axioms on preferences under which a subjective causal expected utility representation exists to model a decision maker's beliefs and preferences
- Shows conditions under which the causal model in the representation is unique
- Allows testing if a decision maker is "causally sophisticated", i.e. their actions can be rationalized by some causal model
- Permits identifying a decision maker's causal judgments from observed behavior when preferences satisfy the axioms
- Relates causal models to the closest-world semantics and uses this connection in the technical results

The results allow modeling and explaining economic behavior in terms of subjective causal judgments. They also facilitate comparing causal models and closest-world counterfactual models in representing decisions involving interventions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper provides an axiomatic characterization of how a decision maker's subjective causal judgments can be inferred from her preferences over hypothetical interventions, establishing a causal expected utility representation with uniqueness conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing an axiomatic characterization of subjective causal expected utility. Specifically, the authors show that if a decision maker's preferences over interventions satisfy certain reasonable axioms, then those preferences can be represented as maximizing expected utility relative to:

1) A causal model $M$ that captures the decision maker's beliefs about causal relationships between variables. 

2) A probability distribution $\mathbb{P}$ over exogenous variables that captures the decision maker's uncertainty.

3) A utility function $\mu$ over outcomes.

The representation theorem allows a modeler to test whether a decision maker's preferences are consistent with some underlying causal model $M$. Additionally, under an extra axiom, the causal model $M$ is unique. This provides a way to identify a decision maker's subjective causal judgments from their preferences over interventions.

In summary, the main contribution is providing foundations for a subjective causal expected utility theory, where causal models and beliefs about interventions can be elicited from preferences. This opens the door to empirically identifying subjective causal relationships from economic behavior.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Causal models / structural equation models
- Interventions
- Counterfactuals 
- Preferences over interventions
- Recursive models
- Subjective causal expected utility 
- Representation theorems
- Axioms (cancellation, model uniqueness, definiteness, centeredness, recursivity)
- Atoms
- Contexts
- Lewis-style models
- Closeness of worlds
- Primitive actions
- Identifiability of causal models

The paper provides an axiomatic framework and representation theorems to characterize a decision maker's subjective causal judgments and preferences over interventions by observing their preferences. Key mathematical concepts include causal models/structural equation models, atoms to describe variable assignments, contexts for the exogenous variables, and axioms that allow representing preferences as maximizing expected utility relative to a causal model. Connections are also drawn to Lewis-style counterfactual models and closeness of worlds. Overall, it provides tools to elicit and identify subjective causal models from preferences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that subjective causal judgments can be elicited from preferences over interventions. What are some of the key advantages of using this approach compared to more direct methods of eliciting causal judgments?

2. The representation theorem relies on several key axioms like cancellation, model uniqueness, definiteness etc. What is the intuition behind some of these axioms and how reasonable are they as assumptions about an agent's preferences?

3. The paper relates the structural equations approach to causality to the closest-worlds semantics used by Lewis and Stalnaker. What is the connection and what does it tell us about these different approaches? 

4. Sequential decisions are mentioned as an area for future work. What complications arise when moving from one-step to multi-step interventions and how might this impact the representation result?

5. The representation ties judgements to expectations of utility. What philosophical issues arise in reducing causal judgments to utilities in this way? How reasonable is this perspective?

6. What types of additional behavioral evidence beyond preference orderings could help test and refine the assumptions made, like the axioms used? 

7. The uniqueness result requires strengthening the definiteness axiom. What exactly does this strengthened axiom capture about an agent's causal perspective? How reasonable is it?

8. What types of causal structures and relationships between variables cannot be captured by the recursive models that are the focus here? What would a representation result look like for non-recursive causal models?

9. The paper focuses on causal models with discrete, finite variable ranges. What are some of the additional complexities that would arise in handling continuous, infinite variable ranges?

10. What empirical evidence is there that real human decision making actually accords with the type of sophisticated causal expected utility maximization assumed by the model? In what ways might the theory need to be extended to better capture real-world behavior?
