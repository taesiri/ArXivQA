# [Few-shot Semantic Image Synthesis with Class Affinity Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02321)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How can we effectively transfer semantic image synthesis models trained on large source datasets to target datasets with only a small number of annotated images?In particular, the paper focuses on developing transfer learning strategies to allow training high-quality generative image models on target datasets with as few as 25-400 annotated images. The key ideas proposed are:- Introducing a class affinity transfer (CAT) approach to align the label spaces between the source and target datasets based on estimated pairwise class relations.- Exploring different methods to estimate these class affinities, using semantic segmentation, vision features, text embeddings.- Integrating CAT into state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion architectures for semantic image synthesis.- Conducting experiments on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff and Cityscapes datasets, showing significant improvements over existing transfer learning techniques.So in summary, the core research question is how to enable effective few-shot transfer learning for semantic image synthesis using estimated class affinities. The paper proposes the CAT approach and demonstrates its effectiveness on standard datasets compared to other transfer techniques.
