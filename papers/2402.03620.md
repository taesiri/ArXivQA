# [Self-Discover: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03620)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in language generation and following instructions. However, their reasoning and problem-solving abilities on complex tasks are still limited. 
- Existing prompting methods make implicit assumptions about the reasoning process needed for a task. But each task requires a unique reasoning structure.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Self-Discover, a framework for LLMs to self-compose reasoning structures for complex reasoning tasks.  
- It has 2 stages: 
   1) Self-discover a task-specific reasoning structure from a set of atomic reasoning modules (e.g. critical thinking, creative thinking). This is done via 3 meta-reasoning actions on the task-level: SELECT relevant modules, ADAPT them to the task, and IMPLEMENT them into an explicit structure.
   2) Solve individual instances by following the self-discovered reasoning structure.

Key Contributions:
- Achieves substantial gains over strong baselines like Chain of Thought on reasoning benchmarks: 7-8% on BigBench-Hard, 27-32% on Thinking for Doing, 1-3% on MATH.
- More efficient than ensemble methods like self-consistency, requiring 10-40x fewer queries.
- Demonstrates transferability of structures from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4. Structures also share commonalities with human reasoning patterns.
- Provides interpretability into model's reasoning process through the self-discovered structures.

In summary, Self-Discover allows language models to uncover task-specific reasoning structures for complex reasoning in an efficient and interpretable manner. Experiments show strong performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across diverse reasoning tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Self-Discover, a framework that guides large language models to self-compose reasoning structures from atomic reasoning modules to solve complex reasoning tasks, outperforming methods like chain of thought while requiring less inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Self-Discover, a general framework for large language models (LLMs) to self-compose reasoning structures to tackle complex reasoning problems. The key ideas are:

1) Self-Discover guides LLMs to select multiple atomic reasoning modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit reasoning structure to follow during decoding. This allows combining strengths of different reasoning approaches. 

2) The self-discovered reasoning structure is task-specific, grounded in atomic reasoning modules, and more efficient than ensemble or inference-heavy methods.

3) Experiments show Self-Discover substantially improves LLM reasoning capability on challenging benchmarks like BigBench-Hard, Thinking for Doing, and MATH over methods like Chain of Thought.

4) Analysis demonstrates the universality of the self-discovered reasoning structures via transferability between models, and commonalities with human reasoning patterns.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Self-Discover for LLMs to automatically compose customized reasoning structures for complex reasoning tasks, which significantly enhances LLM reasoning capability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new framework called "Self-Discover" that allows large language models (LLMs) to self-compose reasoning structures for complex reasoning tasks. How does this framework enable LLMs to uncover unique reasoning patterns compared to other prompting methods that make implicit assumptions about the reasoning process needed?

2. The Self-Discover framework has 3 key actions - Select, Adapt, and Implement. What is the purpose of each action and why is it important for discovering an optimal reasoning structure? How do these actions map to steps in human problem-solving?

3. The paper shows performance gains from using Self-Discover framework across multiple LLM architectures like PaLM, GPT-4, and Llama. What does this transferability of reasoning structures indicate about the universality and interpretability of the discovered structures?

4. Self-Discover achieves superior performance compared to inference-intensive ensemble methods like self-consistency despite requiring far fewer inference calls. What implications does this have for the efficiency and scalability of the framework? 

5. The paper categorizes BBH tasks into 4 types and shows Self-Discover has the maximum gains on world knowledge tasks. Why would self-composing reasoning modules be most helpful for world knowledge compared to other categories?

6. Error analysis on MATH reveals reasoning structure failures account for 25\% errors versus 75\% arising from computation mistakes. How can the framework be enhanced to improve step-wise logical accuracy?

7. The paper compares prompted structures versus optimized prompts and finds structures transfer better from PaLM to GPT. What factors contribute to the robustness of structured plans over wordings?

8. Case studies reveal similarities between human devised and LLM self-discovered reasoning structures. How can we further probe the overlap with human reasoning? What are other ways the structures could be validated?

9. The set of reasoning modules focuses on general high-level strategies. How sensitive is Self-Discover to the breadth and specificity of input modules? What is the tradeoff between generalizability and performance?

10. Self-Discover operates at the task-level to allow per-instance efficiency. Could the framework be extended for interactive step-wise co-reasoning between human and LLM? What would be the design considerations?
