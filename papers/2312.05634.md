# [Pose Guidance by Supervision: A Framework for Clothes-Changing Person   Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05634)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Pose Guidance by Supervision: A Framework for Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification":

Problem:
Person re-identification (ReID) aims to match people across different camera views. A key challenge is clothes changing - when the same person wears different clothes, causing appearance changes that make re-ID difficult. Existing ReID methods rely too much on clothing cues rather than intrinsic biometric traits like face, pose, hair and body shape. This causes poor performance when people change clothes.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes the Pose Guidance by Supervision (PGS) framework to focus learning on intrinsic body cues rather than clothing. PGS has three main components:
1) A human encoder to extract visual features 
2) A fixed pre-trained pose encoder to extract human pose maps
3) A Transformer Transfer Knowledge (TTK) module inserted between the human encoder layers. TTK transfers pose knowledge from the pose encoder to guide human encoder to focus less on clothes.

The framework is trained end-to-end with two losses: 1) Triplet loss for person-specific feature learning 2) Guide loss to transfer pose knowledge into the human encoder via the TTK modules.

Main Contributions:
1) A simple but effective idea to leverage pose estimation features to handle the clothes changing challenge in ReID.
2) A new ReID framework PGS incorporating pose guidance through a novel TTK module to transfer pose knowledge into the model.
3) Extensive experiments showing PGS achieves competitive results on multiple datasets for both clothes-consistent and clothes-changing scenarios.
4) Ablations demonstrating the impact of multi-scale guidance and the benefit of the TTK module.

Overall, the paper presents a simple yet effective pose-guided framework to handle the clothes changing challenge in ReID by reducing reliance on clothing cues.
