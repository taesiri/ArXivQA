# [ZeroNVS: Zero-Shot 360-Degree View Synthesis from a Single Real Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17994)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a 3D-aware diffusion model, ZeroNVS, for single-image novel view synthesis of natural scenes. It trains the model on diverse scene datasets and introduces techniques like camera conditioning and SDS anchoring to address challenges in generating realistic and diverse 360 views.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ZeroNVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for single-image novel view synthesis of in-the-wild scenes. The key innovations are: 1) A new camera conditioning parameterization and normalization scheme that allows training on diverse datasets like CO3D, RealEstate10k, and ACID. This enables strong generalization to real images. 2) An "SDS anchoring" method to improve diversity of predictions, especially backgrounds. Typically SDS lacks diversity, and in 360 scenes this manifests as monotonous backgrounds. Anchoring samples novel views with DDIM first to provide diverse pseudo-targets for SDS. 3) State-of-the-art results on DTU despite being zero-shot, and the proposal of using Mip-NeRF 360 for more challenging viewpoint changes. Overall, ZeroNVS enables high-quality novel view synthesis for full scenes rather than just objects. It trains a diffusion model on diverse data with an improved conditioning scheme, and addresses diversity issues in SDS via anchoring. The method sets SOTA on DTU zero-shot and is the first to tackle full scene synthesis on Mip-NeRF 360.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ZeroNVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for zero-shot 360-degree novel view synthesis from a single image of in-the-wild scenes, using new techniques for camera conditioning, scene normalization, and inference to handle challenges from complex multi-object backgrounds.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop a generative model that can synthesize realistic and diverse novel views of a 3D scene from a single input image?

More specifically, the key goals and hypotheses appear to be:

- Current generative models for novel view synthesis work well for single objects, but have limitations when applied to full scenes with complex backgrounds. The authors hypothesize that new techniques will be needed to handle in-the-wild scenes.

- Prior representations for camera parameters and scale are ambiguous or insufficiently expressive when training on diverse real-world scene datasets. The authors hypothesize that a new conditioning representation and normalization scheme will enable training on diverse data. 

- Standard score distillation sampling (SDS) leads to limited diversity and mode collapse when synthesizing novel views of scenes. The authors hypothesize that their proposed "SDS anchoring" method will improve diversity.

- A single generative model can be trained on a mixture of diverse scene datasets and achieve strong generalization for novel view synthesis on new datasets, without fine-tuning.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that with the right generative model design, conditioning representations, training procedures, and inference techniques, the authors can synthesize high-quality and diverse novel views for complex real-world scenes from just a single input image in a zero-shot generalization setting. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability and analyze the proposed contributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing ZeroNVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for single-image novel view synthesis (NVS) on in-the-wild scenes. The key innovations are:

- A new camera conditioning parameterization and normalization scheme that allows training on diverse scene datasets and handles scale ambiguity better.

- Introducing "SDS anchoring" to address the limited diversity from standard score distillation sampling (SDS) when applied to complex scenes.

2. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the DTU benchmark for single-image NVS, despite being zero-shot.

3. Proposing using the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset as a new challenging benchmark for evaluating single-image NVS with large viewpoint changes.

4. Conducting extensive ablations to validate the proposed techniques, such as the benefits of the novel conditioning scheme and SDS anchoring.

5. Providing strong qualitative and quantitative results, including comparisons to other methods, to demonstrate the effectiveness of ZeroNVS at synthesizing diverse, realistic novel views from a single image on complex real-world scenes.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a diffusion model capable of high-quality zero-shot novel view synthesis on challenging in-the-wild scenes, enabled by technical innovations in conditioning scheme and inference procedure. The effectiveness is demonstrated through state-of-the-art benchmarks, new benchmarks, ablations, and qualitative results.
