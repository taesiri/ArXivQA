# [Complexity-Based Prompting for Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00720)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How does the complexity of reasoning examples/prompts affect the multi-step reasoning performance of large language models?

More specifically, the key hypothesis appears to be:

Using more complex reasoning examples, i.e. those with more reasoning steps, as prompts will improve the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models compared to using simpler examples. 

The paper proposes "complexity-based prompting" which selects complex examples with more reasoning steps as prompts when possible. It also extends this idea to "complexity-based consistency" during decoding, where outputs derived from more complex reasoning chains are favored. 

The central focus seems to be demonstrating, through experiments on math word problems and other reasoning tasks, that prompting with more complex examples consistently improves reasoning performance across different models, datasets, and decoding schemes. Identifying reasoning complexity as an effective selection criteria for eliciting strong reasoning from large LMs appears to be the main thrust and contribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new method called "complexity-based prompting" for selecting effective prompts to elicit multi-step reasoning from large language models. The key idea is to select prompts that have more complex reasoning chains, i.e. more reasoning steps.

- Showing through experiments on math word problems that prompting large language models (GPT-3, Codex) with more complex reasoning chains substantially improves multi-step reasoning accuracy compared to using simple or random prompts.

- Extending the complexity-based selection idea to also selecting the most complex reasoning chains generated by the model during decoding/inference. This further improves accuracy through a complexity-based consistency mechanism.

- Demonstrating that complexity-based prompting is robust and consistently outperforms baselines across different models, prompt distributions, and reasoning tasks. It also has advantages like being simple, intuitive, and annotation efficient.

- Establishing new state-of-the-art results on multiple math and non-math multi-step reasoning benchmarks by applying complexity-based prompting to GPT-3 and Codex.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating complexity-based prompting, a novel and effective prompt selection method for improving multi-step reasoning accuracy of large language models. The key insight is that more complex prompts elicit better reasoning capabilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper studies prompting large language models for multi-step reasoning. It follows recent breakthrough work like Chain-of-Thoughts (Wei et al. 2022) showing that large language models exhibit emergent reasoning abilities when provided reasoning examples. 

- The key focus is on example selection for prompting, identifying reasoning complexity as an effective criterion for selecting effective prompt examples. This differs from prior work on prompt engineering which uses heuristics, optimization, or similarity-based retrieval. The notion of reasoning complexity is novel.

- The proposed methods of complexity-based prompting and consistency significantly outperform prior work like original Chain-of-Thoughts. This demonstrates the impact of reasoning complexity for eliciting multi-step reasoning in large LMs.

- The analysis shows complexity-based prompting is robust to distribution shift and different complexity proxies. This demonstrates it could be widely applicable across diverse reasoning datasets, more so than similarity-based retrieval.

- Overall, the work makes both empirical and theoretical contributions over prior prompting literature. It proposes a simple yet very effective prompt selection scheme and provides extensive analysis into why and when it works. The notion of reasoning complexity could open up new research directions in this space.

In summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in prompting large LMs for multi-step reasoning by identifying reasoning complexity as a key criterion for prompt selection. The empirical gains and analyses help strengthen our understanding of how to best elicit reasoning from large neural models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further investigating the relationship between in-context learning approaches like chain-of-thoughts reasoning and more traditional semantic parsing methods. The authors suggest there may be useful connections to explore between chain-of-thoughts style "logical forms" executed by language models and classical semantic parsing pipelines.

- Exploring different notions of complexity andPrompt Engineering for Multi-Step Reasoninghow they impact prompting effectiveness. The authors primarily used number of reasoning steps as a measure of complexity, but suggest exploring other proxies like question/formula length.

- Better understanding the mechanisms behind why increased reasoning complexity in prompts improves performance, especially for simpler test cases. The authors found intriguing patterns in how models prompted with more complex examples generalized, and suggest further study.

- Applying complexity-based prompting more extensively to additional datasets and task formats beyond the math word problems focused on in this work. The authors propose their methods could generalize more broadly.

- Scaling up experiments to even larger language models as they become available, since prompting approaches seem to benefit substantially from scale. The authors suggest their methods could achieve further gains on models larger than GPT-3.

- Developing additional prompting/decoding algorithms that efficiently elicit multi-step reasoning from language models. The authors hope their work will inspire more research in this emerging area.

In summary, the authors point to many open questions around understanding and improving prompting-based reasoning in large language models as important directions for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for selecting effective prompts to elicit multi-step reasoning from large language models like GPT-3. Previous work has shown that providing a model with a few examples of reasoning chains, called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts, can enable it to perform complex multi-step reasoning on new inputs. This work studies how to select the most effective CoT prompts. It proposes a simple method of selecting prompts that require more reasoning steps, which are considered more complex. Through experiments on math word problem datasets, the authors show that prompting the model with more complex CoT examples consistently improves its reasoning performance over simpler prompts and other prompt selection methods. The gains come from both using more complex prompts as input and selecting more complex reasoning chains generated by the model as output. This intuitive complexity-based prompting approach provides substantial accuracy improvements, is robust to different data distributions, and is easy to implement.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for selecting effective prompts to elicit multi-step reasoning from large language models. The key idea is to select prompt examples that have more complex reasoning chains, as measured by the number of reasoning steps. The authors show that prompting large language models like GPT-3 with examples containing longer reasoning chains substantially improves performance on math word problem datasets compared to using randomly selected or heuristically chosen prompts. This indicates that prompting with complex examples helps elicit stronger reasoning capabilities from large LMs. 

The authors also propose an enhanced decoding method called complexity-based consistency, where they sample multiple reasoning chains from the model and take a majority vote among the outputs with the most reasoning steps. Combining this decoding strategy with the complexity-based prompt selection provides additional gains. The overall approach establishes new state-of-the-art results on multiple math datasets as well as commonsense reasoning tasks, demonstrating the broad applicability. The gains are shown to be robust under different prompt distributions and perturbations. Overall, the simplicity and effectiveness of complexity-based prompting opens interesting research directions in in-context learning and reasoning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for selecting effective prompts for eliciting multi-step reasoning from large language models. The key idea is to select prompts that have more complex reasoning chains, i.e. chains with a greater number of reasoning steps. The intuition is that prompts requiring more steps of reasoning provide better training examples for the model to learn complex multi-step reasoning. The method selects prompts with the most reasoning steps from the training data when available, or uses question length as a proxy for complexity. The selected complex prompts are used as few-shot examples to prompt the model to continue the reasoning chain for new test questions. In addition, at test time complexity is used to select among multiple reasoning chains sampled from the model. Specifically, majority vote is taken over the outputs with the most complex reasoning chains. Experiments on math word problems and other reasoning tasks show substantial gains over baselines by using complexity to select prompts and outputs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to effectively prompt large language models to perform multi-step reasoning. Specifically, the paper focuses on the question of how to select good examples to use as prompts in order to elicit strong reasoning capabilities from the models. 

The introduction discusses how recent works have shown that large language models can demonstrate complex multi-step reasoning abilities when prompted with chains of thought - sequences of short sentences describing reasoning steps. However, the construction of effective prompts has a large impact on the resulting reasoning accuracy. So the key question is how to select prompt examples that will maximize the reasoning performance of the models.

The authors propose and evaluate a method of prompt selection based on reasoning complexity, choosing training examples that have more steps in their annotated reasoning chains. The main hypothesis is that more complex reasoning examples will elicit greater reasoning skills from the model. The paper aims to demonstrate that complexity-based prompt selection outperforms existing methods and results in substantially improved accuracy on multi-step reasoning tasks.

In summary, the key problem is how to select effective prompt examples to maximize language models' multi-step reasoning performance. The authors propose complexity-based selection as a simple but effective approach for eliciting greater reasoning capabilities.
