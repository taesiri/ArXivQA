# [Automated Process Planning Based on a Semantic Capability Model and SMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manufacturing systems and autonomous robots need to be able to quickly adjust to changing requirements and select appropriate systems/functions. This is referred to as "changeability".
- Process planning and replanning must be performed more frequently due to decreasing lot sizes, changing system configurations, and different use cases. Manual process planning is no longer efficient. 
- Existing approaches for automated process planning have drawbacks. Approaches focusing on "capability modeling" (machine-interpretable models capturing all relevant data/knowledge about functions) do not offer robust automated process planning. Approaches focusing on planning require manual effort to create planning encodings and do not satisfy requirements of changeable systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Present an approach that combines capability modeling and automated planning using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). 
- Take an existing ontology-based semantic capability model that has an associated engineering method. Automatically generate an SMT planning problem encoding from this model, without any additional manual effort. 
- Use an off-the-shelf SMT solver to find valid capability sequences including required parameter values that satisfy the planning problem.
- If the generated SMT planning problem is satisfiable, the resulting model is a valid plan consisting of capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Eliminates manual efforts for setting up models for automated planning by using information from a semantic capability model.
- Offers a formal solution for capability planning/matching that works automatically without predefined matched capability combinations.
- Plans to extend approach to automatically transform SMT plans into executable BPMN processes.
- Plans to provide explanations of planning decisions to human users by retrieving additional capability information from ontology.
