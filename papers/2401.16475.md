# [InfoLossQA: Characterizing and Recovering Information Loss in Text   Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16475)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text simplification aims to rewrite complex texts into simpler versions for lay audiences, but often results in deletion of information and introduction of vagueness. 
- Over-simplification can lead to misinterpretations and factual errors, reducing comprehension.
- There is a need to characterize and recover the information loss in an intuitive way to help readers gain fuller understanding.

Proposed Solution - InfoLossQA:  
- A framework to generate question-answer (QA) pairs that reveal information missing from simplified text compared to the original complex text. 
- Inspired by theories of "potential questions" and "Questions Under Discussion (QUD)" to generate curiosity-driven, pragmatically felicitous questions.
- Requires QA pairs to use plain language, be self-contained, and not introduce unfamiliar concepts (givenness constraint).
- Two types of information loss: deletions and oversimplifications (vague/altered meaning).
- Localizes information loss to evidence spans in original and simplified texts.

Key Contributions:
- Linguist-curated dataset of 1,000 QA pairs derived from 104 GPT-4 simplifications of medical abstracts.
- Analysis showing information loss occurs frequently, with QA pairs providing overview. 
- Two methods: end-to-end prompting of LLMs and an NLI pipeline to identify/generate QA pairs.
- Comprehensive evaluation framework with 10 desiderata considering correctness, linguistic suitability and recall of human QAs.
- Expert evaluation reveals models can generate valid QAs but struggle to reliably identify information loss compared to human standards.

In summary, the paper introduces InfoLossQA, a novel framework and dataset to help characterize and recover information lost during text simplification in an intuitive, reader-focused manner. Both the methods and evaluations reveal challenges for LLMs to reach human performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing InfoLossQA, a novel task and linguist-curated dataset to characterize and reveal simplification-induced information loss in the form of question-answer (QA) pairs.

2. Establishing two baselines for the InfoLossQA task: end-to-end prompting of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, and a natural language inference pipeline. 

3. Developing a comprehensive evaluation framework with 10 quality criteria to assess the correctness, linguistic suitability, and human QA recall of automatically generated QA pairs for this task.

4. Conducting extensive experiments and analysis, revealing that while current models have good question generation and answering abilities, they struggle to reliably identify information loss compared to human standards.

In summary, this paper introduces a new dataset and task formulation to reveal lost or vague information in text simplification outputs, in an interactive and user-focused manner. The analysis of current methods shows opportunities for improvement in detecting and conveying information loss suitably for end users.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the InfoLossQA method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes generating QA pairs to characterize information loss during text simplification. What linguistic constraints are placed on the questions to make them suitable for lay readers?

2. The annotation process involves identifying deletions and oversimplifications from the original text. What strategies and heuristics are provided for distinguishing between these two categories?

3. How is the annotation scenario grounded to help annotators decide what information loss is important enough to include in the QA pairs?

4. The analysis shows that technical sections like Methods are most prone to information loss. Why might this section be particularly challenging to simplify without omitting critical details? 

5. What is the motivation behind using the Question Under Discussion framework to model information-seeking questions about the original text based on the simplified version?

6. Two methods are proposed for generating QA pairs - end-to-end LLM prompting and an NLI pipeline. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses uncovered in the analysis for each approach?

7. The evaluation framework evaluates the QA pairs on both correctness and linguistic suitability. What specific criteria are used to assess the quality along these two angles?

8. Across the models analyzed, where do they tend to struggle when it comes to reliably identifying valid information loss between the original and simplified texts?

9. The analysis reveals differences in question compositionality between humans and models - aggregating smaller facts into larger questions vs. narrow questions on distinct facts. What future work directions are proposed to address this?

10. What are some limitations of the study, and what kinds of additional experiments are needed to further analyze the real-world viability of the proposed InfoLossQA framework?
