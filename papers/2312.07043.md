# [The Complexity of Envy-Free Graph Cutting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of fairly dividing a heterogeneous divisible resource represented as a connected graph between multiple agents with different preferences. The aim is to divide the graph into connected pieces and assign them to agents in an envy-free manner, i.e., every agent prefers the piece they receive over any piece that another agent receives. Two variants are studied: graph cutting where agents cannot share vertices and vertex-disjoint graph cutting where vertices can be shared. 

It is known that contiguous envy-free solutions always exist when the graph is a path. The paper studies whether solutions exist and can be efficiently computed when the underlying graph is more general.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) Hardness results:
- Both problems are NP-hard even for 2 agents, by reductions from number partitioning. This holds even for very simple graphs like a matching plus two vertices. 
- Both problems are NP-hard for 2 agents on graphs with treewidth 2 and max degree 3.

2) Algorithmic results when number of agents is constant:
- Vertex-disjoint graph cutting is solvable in polynomial time on trees.
- Graph cutting requires both constant treewidth and max degree to be solvable in polynomial time.
- Both problems can be solved in polynomial time on cycles.

3) Algorithm for graphs with constant number of edges:
- The main result is an XP algorithm running in time $|A|^{O(|E|^2)}$ for both problems when parameterized by number of edges |E|. Uses a combination of branching, linear programming with additional geometric insights, and bipartite matching.

4) Open questions:
- Is there an FPT algorithm for graph cutting parameterized by |E|? What about when graph is a path?
- Explore fine-grained parameterized complexity.

The paper significantly advances the understanding of the classical and parameterized complexity of envy-free fair division on graphs. The combinatorial algorithm given for graphs with constant edges using a mix of techniques is the highlight.
