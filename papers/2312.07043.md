# [The Complexity of Envy-Free Graph Cutting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07043)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies the computational complexity of fairly dividing a heterogeneous divisible resource represented as a graph between agents with different preferences, under the standard fairness notion of envy-freeness. While the problem is NP-complete in general, the paper provides a thorough analysis along two parameters: the number of agents and the number of edges in the graph. For a constant number of agents, the paper gives a dichotomy for the complexity based on structural graph properties, showing hardness even on simple graphs but also obtaining polynomial-time algorithms for restricted graph classes. As the main algorithmic contribution, the paper provides an XP algorithm solving the problem in polynomial-time when the number of edges is a constant. To achieve this, the algorithm employs a combination of branching techniques, construction of appropriate linear programs, and usage of structural insights related to multidimensional geometry. The paper concludes with multiple directions for future work, including investigating whether fixed-parameter tractability can be obtained and determining the fine-grained complexity of special cases.
