# [Vaccine: Perturbation-aware Alignment for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01109)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being deployed using a "finetuning-as-a-service" approach where users can finetune the model on their own data. However, this exposes a security risk as a few harmful examples in the user's data can negatively impact the model's safety and alignment. 

- The paper investigates this problem and finds that finetuning on even a small portion of harmful data can significantly degrade the model's alignment, an effect they term "harmful embedding drift." The drift is more severe when more harmful data is present during finetuning.

Proposed Solution - Vaccine:  
- Vaccine is a new perturbation-aware alignment technique that modifies the alignment stage to make the LLM more robust to harmful finetuning data. 

- It works by adding bounded perturbations to the hidden embeddings during alignment training. These perturbations maximize the alignment loss, forcing the model to learn embeddings that can withstand this synthetic drift.

- This results in embeddings that are more invariant to real drift introduced by harmful finetuning data. Vaccine requires two forward/backward passes but only modifies the alignment stage.

Main Contributions:
- Discovery of "harmful embedding drift" phenomenon during finetuning that correlates with loss of alignment.

- A new security-focused alignment technique, Vaccine, that strengthens model robustness despite no knowledge of the specific finetuning data.

- Experiments showing Vaccine reduces harmful scores by up to 9.8% on major LLMs while maintaining good performance on downstream tasks when finetuning data contains harmful instructions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Vaccine, a perturbation-aware alignment method to mitigate harmful embedding drift in large language models that is caused by fine-tuning on user data containing malicious content; evaluation shows Vaccine improves robustness against broken alignments while maintaining performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It discovers a "harmful embedding drift" phenomenon - the embedding of original alignment data would largely change after finetuning on partially harmful data. It identifies this as the cause of broken alignment after finetuning.

2. It develops Vaccine, a perturbation-aware alignment method that modifies only the alignment stage to make the aligned model more robust to finetuning on potentially harmful user data. Vaccine has no assumption of access to the user finetuning data.

3. It evaluates Vaccine on mainstream open source LLMs like Llama2, Opt, Vicuna. Results show Vaccine can boost alignment robustness against harmful prompts while preserving reasoning ability on benign prompts. Specifically, it reduces harmful scores by up to 9.8% compared to standard alignment, with only negligible loss (up to 1.8%) on downstream tasks.

The paper discusses issues with using user-provided data to finetune large language models, which can potentially compromise model safety and alignment. It analyzes the problem of "harmful embedding drift" when finetuning on data with some harmful examples. The main contribution is a proposed method called "Vaccine" which is a perturbation-aware alignment technique to improve robustness against harmful finetuning data. The approach draws inspiration from methods in continual learning/catastrophic forgetting. Overall, the key focus areas are model alignment, robustness, and responsible deployment of LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How exactly does the perturbation-aware alignment technique strengthen the resilience of the aligned model to handle harmful prompts during finetuning? What is the intuition behind adding crafted perturbations to the embeddings?

2) The paper mentions utilizing gradient-based perturbations rather than random perturbations. What is the rationale behind using gradient-based perturbations? What are the specific advantages compared to random perturbations? 

3) The Double-LoRA implementation trains two separate adaptors for alignment and finetuning. What is the motivation behind training two separate adaptors instead of using a single shared adaptor? What are the tradeoffs?

4) What types of optimizations could be applied to reduce the additional computational overhead and memory consumption introduced by the proposed method? Could techniques like pruning or factorization help address these issues? 

5) How well would the proposed technique generalize to other foundation models besides large language models, such as diffusion or multi-modal models? What modifications or extensions would need to be made?

6) How does the proposed technique compare to existing methods for preventing catastrophic forgetting? What are the key differences in methodology and underlying assumptions?

7) Could the technique be combined with customized finetuning methods that try to detect or filter out harmful data points in the user-provided dataset? What approaches seem promising?

8) What types of theoretical bounds could be derived on the robustness or stability guarantees provided by this perturbation-aware alignment technique? 

9) The technique currently works for supervised fine-tuning-based alignment methods. How could the core ideas be extended to reinforcement learning based approaches for alignment as well?

10) What additional empirical evaluations could be done regarding factors like hyperparameters, model architectures, or types of prompts to further analyze the robustness and limits of the proposed technique?
