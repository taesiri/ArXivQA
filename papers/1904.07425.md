# [The Geometry of Bayesian Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07425)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a denotational semantics for PCFSS, a higher-order functional programming language with sampling from a uniform continuous distribution and scoring. The central research question is how to give a denotational semantics to this probabilistic higher-order programming language that is adequate with respect to both a sampling-based operational semantics and a distribution-based operational semantics.

The key contributions and hypotheses are:

- Introducing a version of Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI) based on measurable spaces and partial measurable functions to model PCFSS. This involves defining Mealy machines over measurable spaces to handle bidirectional computation and developing their behavioral theory. 

- Using this GoI semantics to give interpretations to the types and terms of PCFSS, including probabilistic primitives like sampling and scoring. The interpretation uses a graphical representation of linear logic proof structures.

- Proving two main adequacy theorems showing the GoI semantics coincides with the operational semantics, for both the sampling-based and distribution-based versions. This shows the two operational semantics are equivalent.

- Demonstrating that the GoI semantics enables diagrammatic reasoning for observational equivalence of PCFSS programs based on the compact closed structure.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a GoI model based on measurable spaces can provide an adequate semantics for a higher-order probabilistic language like PCFSS. The technical contribution is developing such a GoI model and proving it is adequate with respect to operational semantics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a new denotational semantics for a higher-order probabilistic programming language called PCFSS. The main contributions are:

1. It introduces a new semantics based on Girard's Geometry of Interaction, using measurable spaces and partial measurable functions. This is the first semantics of its kind for a higher-order probabilistic language. 

2. It defines a version of Mealy machines over measurable spaces to interpret terms and proofs. The machines have state and interact via input/output along communication channels.

3. It gives two operational semantics for PCFSS - a sampling-based semantics and a distribution-based semantics. It proves adequacy theorems showing the denotational semantics corresponds to both operational semantics.

4. As a consequence of the adequacy theorems, it shows the two operational semantics are equivalent, despite being defined quite differently.

5. The semantics enables diagrammatic reasoning about programs using the compact closed structure. Equivalent diagrams imply observational equivalence of terms.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a new denotational semantics for higher-order probabilistic programming using Geometry of Interaction. This is shown to adequately model both a sampling-based and distribution-based operational semantics. The work opens up a new semantic paradigm for probabilistic languages.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a denotational semantics for a higher-order functional language with continuous probability distributions based on measurable spaces and an extension of Girard's Geometry of Interaction, and proves the equivalence between its sampling-based and distribution-based operational semantics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new denotational semantics for higher-order probabilistic programming languages using ideas from geometry of interaction. It differs from previous work in some key ways:

- Simplicity: The semantics is developed using basic concepts like measurable spaces and partial measurable functions. It does not require advanced domain theory or topology like some other semantics. The model is presented intuitively using graphical notation.

- Intuitiveness: The semantics validates intuitive program equivalences related to scoring and sampling. This is in contrast to some other semantics where basic rules for scoring do not hold. 

- Adequacy: The semantics is shown to be fully abstract with respect to both a sampling-based and distribution-based operational semantics. This required developing a non-trivial logical relations argument.

- Novelty: Geometry of interaction has not been applied in this way before to probabilistic programming languages. The idea of using "bidirectional" Mealy machines seems new.

So in summary, the main contributions are in developing a novel denotational semantics based on geometry of interaction that captures precise program equivalences while still being intuitive. The technical development of the model and proofs of adequacy are also significant contributions.

Compared to other recent works like on quasicontinuous domains or probabilistic coherence spaces, this semantics has some advantages in terms of simplicity and adequacy to an operational semantics. However, those other models may have benefits in terms of validating more program equivalences related to effects. Overall, this appears to be a valuable new perspective and technique for giving semantics to higher-order probabilistic programs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest two main directions for future research:

1. Exploring the relationship between "idealised" normalization mechanisms like Gaussian or Dirichlet processes, and "approximating" normalization mechanisms like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The authors suggest it may be possible to capture sampling algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings in their semantics, even though their current semantics does not support normalization as a first-class operator. They suggest it would be interesting to explore the connections between these two kinds of normalization mechanisms from the perspective of geometry of interaction.

2. Making connections between their work and other works on diagrammatic reasoning for probabilistic computation, such as the string diagram calculus of Cho and Jacobs, and the probabilistic coherence spaces of Jean-Simon Lemay, Sam Staton and Hongseok Yang. The authors note that it follows from their adequacy theorems that diagrammatic equivalence of denotations implies observational equivalence of programs. So they suggest it may be fruitful to further explore these connections.

In summary, the main future directions proposed are:

- Comparing idealized and approximate Bayesian inference algorithms through the lens of geometry of interaction

- Connecting to other graphical/diagrammatic techniques for reasoning about probabilistic programs

The authors position their work as opening up a new perspective on semantics for higher-order probabilistic programming, and suggest further developing this new perspective by making comparisons to other techniques, and exploring how it can be used for reasoning tasks, is an interesting direction for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a denotational semantics for PCFSS, a higher-order functional programming language with sampling from a uniform continuous distribution and scoring. The semantics is based on Girard's Geometry of Interaction using measurable spaces and partial measurable functions. Terms and values of PCFSS are interpreted as Mealy machines, which model interactive input/output behavior. Two adequacy theorems are proven relating the denotational semantics to both a distribution-based operational semantics and a sampling-based operational semantics. It follows that the two operational semantics are essentially equivalent. The semantics enables diagrammatic reasoning about programs using the graphical representation of linear logic proofs. Overall, the paper provides a novel denotational semantics for probabilistic programming using ideas from geometry of interaction.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper proposes a new denotational semantics for higher-order probabilistic programming languages using the geometry of interaction. The authors consider a higher-order functional language called PCFSS with sampling from a uniform continuous distribution and scoring. They define two operational semantics for PCFSS - a distribution-based semantics which associates terms with distributions over real numbers, and a sampling-based semantics which associates terms with weights along probabilistic branches. 

The main contribution is a geometry of interaction model for PCFSS based on measurable spaces and partial measurable functions. Terms and types are interpreted as certain Mealy machines over measurable spaces. Key technical ingredients include a behavioural equivalence relation between Mealy machines, diagrammatic reasoning enabled by the compact closed structure, and an iteration operator for least fixed points needed to interpret recursion. One of the main results is adequacy theorems showing the denotational semantics matches both the distribution-based and sampling-based operational semantics. This provides a new perspective on semantics of higher-order probabilistic programs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is to give a denotational semantics for a higher-order functional programming language with sampling from a uniform continuous distribution and scoring (PCFSS) using ideas from geometry of interaction (GoI). The key steps are:

- They define a category of measurable spaces and partial measurable functions, which has the necessary structure (traced symmetric monoidal) for applying the Int-construction to get a model of linear logic. 

- They introduce Mealy machines on measurable spaces to interpret proofs as morphisms, extending Girard's GoI to handle stateful computations. Mealy machines behave like input/output automata.

- They use a state monad to model sampling and scoring effects. Sampling is modeled as a nondeterministic transition that picks a random number, while scoring multiplies the weight.

- Terms and types of PCFSS are interpreted as Mealy machines. The interpretation is defined compositionally using constructions like composition, tensor product, modal operators on Mealy machines. 

- They prove adequacy theorems showing the denotational semantics coincides with both a sampling-based operational semantics and a distribution-based operational semantics. This validates the model and shows the two operational semantics are equivalent.

So in summary, they use a version of GoI on measurable spaces combined with a state monad to model a higher-order probabilistic language with continuous distributions, and prove it is fully abstract w.r.t. two styles of operational semantics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper presents a denotational semantics for a higher-order probabilistic programming language called PCFSS, which includes primitives for sampling from a uniform distribution and scoring. The main contributions are:

- Developing a version of Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI) based on measurable spaces to give denotational semantics to PCFSS. This involves defining Mealy machines over measurable spaces and using them to model programs.

- Providing two operational semantics for PCFSS - a sampling-based semantics and a distribution-based semantics. 

- Proving adequacy results showing the denotational semantics corresponds to both operational semantics. This shows the operational semantics are equivalent. 

- Demonstrating the denotational semantics enables diagrammatic reasoning about program equivalence.

So in summary, it tackles the problem of developing denotational semantics for higher-order probabilistic programming languages, particularly focused on languages with continuous probability distributions. This requires extending GoI to measurable spaces and showing the model is fully abstract with respect to operational semantics.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords are:

- Probabilistic programming languages - The paper focuses on giving semantics to higher-order probabilistic programming languages, which allow expressing probabilistic models in a compositional way.

- Bayesian programming - The probabilistic programming languages considered allow defining Bayesian models and performing Bayesian inference.

- Denotational semantics - The main contribution is a denotational semantics for a higher-order probabilistic programming language called PCFSS.

- Geometry of interaction - The denotational semantics is based on Girard's geometry of interaction, which provides a way to construct semantics for higher-order languages from semantics of first-order fragments. 

- Mealy machines - The semantics interprets terms as Mealy machines, a type of finite state machine with input and output.

- Adequacy - The paper proves adequacy results showing the correspondence between the denotational semantics and operational semantics.

- Sampling-based semantics - One of the operational semantics is sampling-based, generating samples from the probabilistic execution.

- Distribution-based semantics - The other operational semantics directly computes the distribution defined by a term.

- Monads - The probabilistic features are encapsulated in a state monad in the semantics.

- Logical relations - Logical relations are used to prove the adequacy results relating the semantics to the operational behavior.

So in summary, the key terms are probabilistic programming languages, Bayesian inference, denotational semantics, geometry of interaction, Mealy machines, adequacy, sampling-based semantics, distribution-based semantics, monads, and logical relations. The semantics is for a higher-order language but makes use of first-order Mealy machines.
