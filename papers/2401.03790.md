# [Inferring Properties of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective at modeling graph-structured data but are difficult to debug due to their complex message-passing mechanisms. 
- Existing property inference techniques can analyze feedforward and convolutional neural networks but cannot handle GNNs' dynamic input structures.
- There is a need for automated techniques to analyze and debug GNN models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GNN-Infer, the first automated property inference technique for GNNs. 
- GNN-Infer first extracts the most frequent and influential substructures from the GNN's dataset.
- For each influential substructure, GNN-Infer converts the GNN model into an equivalent feedforward neural network (FNN) and infers properties using existing FNN verification tools.
- It generalizes the structure-specific properties into likely properties that hold for graphs containing those substructures.
- It further refines the properties by training decision trees or regression models to capture deviations between the properties and actual GNN outputs.

Main Contributions:
- Formal proof and algorithm to convert a GNN model paired with a substructure into an equivalent FNN model.
- Method to extract influential substructures and infer precise properties on them.
- Technique to generalize properties by relaxing structure constraints and augmenting them with dynamic features.
- Evaluation showing GNN-Infer can infer correct properties on synthetic GNNs and use properties to detect backdoors in real-world GNNs.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel automated technique called GNN-Infer to analyze graph neural networks. By converting GNN computations on substructures to equivalent feedforward networks, GNN-Infer enables extending existing DNN verification approaches to debug complex graph-based models. Experiments demonstrate its ability to infer precise properties and detect backdoors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GNNInfer, the first automatic property inference technique for graph neural networks that handles their dynamic input structures by identifying influential substructures, converting graph neural networks into equivalent feedforward neural networks to leverage existing inference tools, and generalizing inferred properties using dynamic analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing GNNInfer, the first automatic property inference technique for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, GNNInfer tackles the key challenge of handling dynamic input graph structures in GNNs by:

1) Extracting the most frequent influential substructures from the GNN model and dataset. These small but influential structures are more efficient to analyze and can reveal common behaviors of the GNN. 

2) Converting each influential structure and the GNN model into an equivalent feedforward neural network (FNN). This enables leveraging existing FNN property inference techniques to analyze the behavior of the GNN on that structure.

3) Generalizing the inferred properties on structures to properties that hold for any input graph containing those structures. This is done by relaxing structural constraints and adding dynamic features to capture effects of surrounding graphs.

4) Showing applications of the inferred properties in defending against backdoor attacks on GNNs. Experiments demonstrate GNNInfer can improve defense success rate by up to 30 times over baseline methods.

In summary, the key innovation is developing the first automated technique to infer formal interpretable properties of graph neural networks by tackling the central challenge of handling varying graphical input structures. Both the correctness on synthetic benchmarks and utility in explaining backdoor behaviors showcase the promise of this approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Graph neural networks (GNNs): The paper focuses on analyzing and inferring properties of graph neural networks, which are neural networks that operate on graph-structured data.

- Property inference: The paper introduces a technique called "GNNInfer" to automatically infer likely properties of GNN models. These properties capture relationships between the input and output of the GNN.

- Influential structures: The technique identifies a set of frequent and influential substructures in the graph that significantly impact the GNN's predictions. Properties are inferred with respect to these structures.

- GNN to FNN conversion: A key theoretical contribution is an algorithm to convert a GNN operating on a fixed graph structure to an equivalent feedforward neural network (FNN). This enables inferring GNN properties by leveraging existing techniques for FNNs.

- Backdoor attack defense: One application of the inferred properties is defending against backdoor attacks on GNNs by identifying and pruning graphs matching likely backdoor properties.

- Graph matching: Techniques like graph isomorphism and subgraph isomorphism are used to identify graphs matching certain structural constraints.

So in summary, key terms cover property inference, influential structures, GNN to FNN conversion, backdoor defense, and graph matching in the context of analyzing graph neural networks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes converting graph neural networks (GNNs) to equivalent feedforward neural networks (FNNs) to enable property inference. What are the key challenges in directly applying existing FNN property inference techniques to GNNs? How does the conversion address these challenges?

2. The algorithm for converting a GNN to an FNN requires a fixed input graph structure. What impact does this have on the applicability of the inferred properties? How does the paper attempt to generalize the properties to handle varying graph structures?

3. Explain in detail the process of extracting the most frequent influential structures from the GNN model and dataset. What is the intuition behind using these structures for property inference? How does GNNExplainer and gSpan fit into this process?  

4. The conversion of a GNN model and input structure to an FNN relies on a theoretical proof that this transformation is sound and complete. Summarize the key lemmas and overall argumentOutline the proof strategy. What are the implications of this theoretical foundation?  

5. Once an influential structure is converted with the GNN into an FNN, the method infers properties using the PROPHECY tool. What instrumentation and analysis does PROPHECY perform to infer input-output relationships? How does this enable extracting structure-specific properties of the GNN?

6. Structure-specific properties only hold for graphs isomorphic to the analyzed structure. How does the method generalize to subgraph-isomorphic graphs? Why do these relaxed properties lose precision?

7. Explain the purpose and workings of the dynamic analysis step for refining likely properties into more precise dynamic feature properties. How does the analysis differ for classification vs. regression GNN models?

8. The evaluation analyzes inference correctness on reference GNNs modeling classic graph algorithms. Why is this an appropriate benchmark? Summarize the ground truth properties and assessment of results for BFS, DFS and Bellman-Ford networks.  

9. As an application of property inference, the method targets detecting backdoors in GNN models. Explain how the inferred properties are used to identify potential backdoors and defend against them. How does the approach compare to existing detection methods?

10. The conversion of GNNs to FNNs relies on the message passing formulation. What are limitations of the approach for other GNN architectures like graph attention networks? How might the method be extended?
