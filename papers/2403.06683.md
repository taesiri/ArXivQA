# [Transferring Relative Monocular Depth to Surgical Vision with Temporal   Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monocular depth estimation (estimating depth from a single image) is an important capability for surgical vision tasks, but there is a lack of surgical datasets with ground truth depth to train models. 
- State-of-the-art monocular depth models for natural images are trained on huge datasets (millions of images) which don't exist for surgery. 
- Directly applying natural image models to surgery often fails due to uncertainty in depth ordering of semantic elements, leading to temporally inconsistent predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- Compile Meta-MED, the first meta-dataset for monocular depth in endoscopy by combining multiple small surgical datasets.
- Show that state-of-the-art natural image models (MiDaS, DepthAnything) can generalize reasonably to surgery but benefit from fine-tuning on Meta-MED.
- Propose a temporal consistency self-supervision loss to improve consistency over time. Compare to standard supervised loss and augmentation consistency self-supervision loss.
- Demonstrate temporal consistency loss significantly improves performance, outperforming both standard supervised fine-tuning and augmentation consistency self-supervision.

Main Contributions:
- Meta-MED dataset for training and evaluating monocular depth models on endoscopy
- Show strong performance from transferring state-of-the-art natural image models to surgery
- Propose temporal consistency self-supervision which outperforms standard techniques
- Models significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art method designed for endoscopy
- Release code, models and Meta-MED dataset to facilitate future research
