# [MORL-Prompt: An Empirical Analysis of Multi-Objective Reinforcement   Learning for Discrete Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11711)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Discrete prompt tuning involves searching for prompts that maximize multiple reward functions when fed into a language model. 
- However, these rewards are often in tension (e.g. content preservation vs style matching). 
- Current techniques focus on maximizing average reward, but this can fail to achieve balance across rewards.

Proposed Solution:
- Adapt multi-objective optimization techniques to prompt tuning using RL:
   - Hypervolume indicator (HVI): Measures volume under Pareto frontier of rewards
   - Expected product of rewards: Simpler proxy for volume  
   - Multiple gradient descent (MGDA): Approximates gradient of each reward and searches for update direction that benefits all

Contributions:
- Formulate prompt tuning as multi-objective RL problem
- Empirically compare HVI, expected product, MGDA to baseline average reward
- Evaluate on style transfer and machine translation tasks using competing rewards 
- Show volume-based methods (HVI and product) achieve better balance and outperform baselines
- HVI can be sensitive to outlier samples, product of rewards is more robust
- MGDA improves balance but not as effectively as volume-based approaches

In summary, the paper adapts multi-objective optimization techniques to discrete prompt tuning using RL. It shows that directly optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface leads to better balance across competing rewards than methods based on maximizing the average or finding monotonic update directions. The work provides an empirical analysis on style transfer and machine translation tasks.
