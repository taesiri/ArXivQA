## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for high-quality and complete facial geometry and appearance capture from a single co-located smartphone flashlight video captured in a dim room. A key contribution is a hybrid face representation combining sphere eyeball meshes with diffuse albedo and a neural SDF field with a neural reflectance field to represent skin, mouth interior and hair. This exploits the benefits of priors for eyeballs while retaining flexibility for other face regions. A mesh-aware volume rendering technique is introduced to integrate eyeball meshes into the volume rendering process. To enable training from a convenient capture setup, a combined lighting model with smartphone flashlight and low-frequency ambient light is applied along with a reflectance constraint using the AlbedoMM model. Experiments demonstrate plausible disentanglement of diffuse and specular components and high-quality relightable face scans. The method captures various identities and expressions. Combining with reflectance transfer allows relightable performance capture. Limitations include reliance on manual eyeball calibration and simplified hair modeling. Key contributions are the hybrid representation, lighting model and training strategies that enable high-quality facial capture from easy homemade capture.
