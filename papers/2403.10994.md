# [SSUP-HRI: Social Signaling in Urban Public Human-Robot Interaction   dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10994)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There is a lack of understanding and datasets related to naturalistic human-robot interactions, especially in uncontrolled public spaces. Most prior work has focused on controlled lab settings or semi-public spaces like hotels. As robots become more common in public spaces, we need to understand how people interact with and perceive them. This requires studying the subtle social signals people exchange with robots in situated contexts. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors present a novel dataset (SSUP-HRI) featuring over 15 hours of video footage and 274 annotated human-robot interactions in a busy public plaza in New York City. They deployed two trash barrel robots operated via Wizard-of-Oz to collect trash. The robots roved around interacting with people through movement, the only mode of interaction available to them. Two cameras on the robots captured people's reactions and social signals from the robot's perspective during these naturalistic interactions.

Main Contributions:
- The first public space HRI dataset featuring completely uncontrolled interactions (no prescribed tasks)
- Rich set of unprompted natural social signals exchanged during negotiations between groups of people and robots 
- Wizard-of-Oz protocol enabled robots to respond appropriately, making the interactions and data more naturalistic
- Over 15 hours of egocentric video from robot's perspective showcasing subtle signals people use to initiate, interact with and terminate encounters
- Precise annotations for 274 HRI scenarios, with rich details on 118 trash disposal interactions 
- Test bed for social scientists and machine learning researchers to study public space HRI through both qualitative and quantitative analysis

The dataset enables studying the dynamics of naturalistic human-robot interactions to model social intelligence for robots to safely navigate shared public spaces.
