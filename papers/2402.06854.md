# [Gyroscope-Assisted Motion Deblurring Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Motion blur caused by camera shake is a major issue degrading image quality. Existing methods for synthesizing motion blur datasets and removing blur have limitations:
  - Synthesis methods assume all pixels have the same blur kernel, unlike real blur. 
  - Deblurring methods lack precise blur trajectory information to guide restoration.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a framework to leverage blur trajectories for blur synthesis and removal. The key components are:
  - A strategy to generate pixel-aligned and realistic motion blur training triplets (clear image, blurred image, blur heatmap) using IMU sensor data during camera motion.
  - A Gyroscope-Aided Motion Deblurring (GAMD) network that takes the blurred image and blur heatmap as input to guide precise deblurring.

Key Contributions:
- Derivation of mathematical relationship between camera motion trajectories captured by IMU and blur trajectories of each image pixel.
- Efficient synthesis strategy to create a large-scale blurred image dataset (IMU-Blur) with 8350 pixel-aligned triplets.
- Introduction of blur heatmaps based on Bezier curves fitted to blur trajectories to guide GAMD network.
- State-of-the-art deblurring performance: GAMD improves PSNR by 33.17% over previous methods on the authors' IMU-Blur dataset.

In summary, the key innovation is using IMU sensors to precisely model blur trajectories for each pixel, enabling more realistic motion blur synthesis and trajectory-guided deblurring with GAMD network. The framework and datasets are valuable contributions for blur-related tasks.
