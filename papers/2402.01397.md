# [A survey on robustness in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles is important but current models show signs of overfitting and lack of robustness. This can lead to unsafe behavior. 
- There is a need for a structured framework to categorize and assess existing strategies for evaluating and improving the robustness of trajectory prediction models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a general framework with four main components:
  1) Robustness evaluation strategies: Test model on sliced data scenarios or perturbed data
  2) Robustness improvement strategies: Modify training data, model architecture, or trained model 
  3) Specific methods related to these strategies 
  4) Performance measures to quantify accuracy and robustness

- The framework synthesizes approaches currently used in literature for making trajectory predictions more robust.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of research on evaluating and enhancing robustness of trajectory prediction
- Identification of two main evaluation strategies involving testing on sliced and perturbed data
- Outlining four key improvement strategies: slice training data differently, introduce perturbed data, modify model architecture, refine trained model   
- Review of specific methods for each strategy such as perturbations, adversarial training, architectural changes
- Discussion of limitations of current literature, e.g. lack of model modification post-training, use of limited performance measures
- Suggestions for future work - compare adversarial training methods, design unified framework to combine methods, explore physics-informed neural networks

In summary, the paper proposes a structured framework to categorize and assess robustness of trajectory prediction models, highlights limitations of current literature, and outlines promising future research directions in this domain.
