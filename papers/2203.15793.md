# [Instance Relation Graph Guided Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform source-free domain adaptive object detection, i.e. adapting an object detector trained on a source domain to a new target domain without access to the original source domain data. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method to address two key challenges in source-free domain adaptive detection:

1) Effectively distilling target domain information into the source-trained model

2) Enhancing the feature representations of the target domain data

To address the first challenge, the paper utilizes a student-teacher framework to distill knowledge from the source-trained model into the target domain in a self-training manner. 

For the second challenge, the key contribution is a novel contrastive learning strategy to improve target domain features. This is done by using a graph convolutional network called the Instance Relation Graph (IRG) to model relationships between object proposals. The learned relationships guide a graph-based contrastive loss that encourages more discriminative representations.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining student-teacher distillation and graph-guided contrastive learning, they can achieve effective source-free domain adaptive object detection without needing the original source training data. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on multiple detection benchmarks.
