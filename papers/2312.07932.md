## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel image classification framework based on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that eliminates the need for global pooling operations commonly used before the final classification layer in classical frameworks. The key idea is to leverage the powerful data storage and expressiveness capabilities of VQAs to fully preserve and utilize the high-dimensional feature maps extracted by the backbone model, rather than collapsing them via global pooling which leads to loss of critical spatial details and discriminative information. Specifically, the framework employs amplitude embedding to encode the feature maps into the amplitudes of a quantum state followed by a parameterized quantum circuit, together referred to as an amplitude-embedding VQC (AE-VQC). Despite removing global pooling, this AE-VQC involves fewer parameters than classical fully-connected layers thanks to the locality of quantum operations. Experiments conducted on two state-of-the-art classical image classification models (ResNet and MaxViT) over four public datasets demonstrate significant performance gains from the proposed quantum framework in terms of accuracy and F1 score, validating its effectiveness. The framework is highly adaptable and can augment most existing classical models to boost their capabilities for tasks requiring fine-grained visual details.

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel image classification framework based on variational quantum algorithms. The key features of this framework are:

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Image classification models typically employ a global pooling operation before the final classification layer to reduce spatial dimensions of feature maps extracted by the backbone (feature extractor) model. While global pooling helps mitigate overfitting and computational expenses, it results in a loss of spatial details and fine-grained information that can be crucial for recognition tasks requiring localization and discrimination.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel quantum image classification framework based on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that eliminates the need for global pooling. The framework employs an amplitude embedding based VQA (AE-VQC) module in place of the global pooling layer to fully preserve spatial details from the backbone's feature maps for classification, while keeping model parameters low.

Key Details:
- The AE-VQC module consists of:
   1) An amplitude encoding layer that compresses high-dimensional classical feature maps into the amplitudes of a quantum state represented by exponentially fewer qubits.
   2) A parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) that transforms the encoded state.
   3) Measurements for decoding final state into useful features.
- Two sample ansatzes employing single qubit rotation and CNOT gates are evaluated.
- Eliminating global pooling retains fine-grained details for better discrimination, while amplitude encoding and localized gates keep quantum circuit parameters low.
- Framework is flexible and applicable to different backbone architectures like CNNs and Vision Transformers.

Experiments and Results:
- Framework applied to ResNet-18 and MaxViT-T backbones for image classification on 4 public datasets - Croatian Fish, Aircraft models, Breast Cancer Ultrasounds, Apples vs Tomatoes
- Proposed quantum models outperform classical counterparts on all datasets, improving accuracy and F1 score by up to 10% despite having fewer parameters
- Validates effectiveness and practicality of proposed technique with state-of-the-art backbone models on complex real-world tasks 

Main Contributions:
- Novel VQA based image classification framework that eliminates need for global pooling layer
- Introduces amplitude encoded VQA module to retain spatial details at low parameters
- Demonstrates significant performance improvements over classical models using less parameters
- Establishes practicality with state-of-the-art backbones on real complex image datasets

The key idea is to replace the global pooling operation, which causes loss of important fine details, with a specialized VQA module that can compress high-dimensional feature maps into a quantum state using exponentially fewer qubits. This preserves spatial details to enhance discrimination, while keeping parameters contained due to amplitude encoding and localized quantum gates. The framework demonstrates substantial gains over classical approaches on practical recognition tasks.
