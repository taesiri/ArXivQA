## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel image classification framework based on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that eliminates the need for global pooling operations commonly used before the final classification layer in classical frameworks. The key idea is to leverage the powerful data storage and expressiveness capabilities of VQAs to fully preserve and utilize the high-dimensional feature maps extracted by the backbone model, rather than collapsing them via global pooling which leads to loss of critical spatial details and discriminative information. Specifically, the framework employs amplitude embedding to encode the feature maps into the amplitudes of a quantum state followed by a parameterized quantum circuit, together referred to as an amplitude-embedding VQC (AE-VQC). Despite removing global pooling, this AE-VQC involves fewer parameters than classical fully-connected layers thanks to the locality of quantum operations. Experiments conducted on two state-of-the-art classical image classification models (ResNet and MaxViT) over four public datasets demonstrate significant performance gains from the proposed quantum framework in terms of accuracy and F1 score, validating its effectiveness. The framework is highly adaptable and can augment most existing classical models to boost their capabilities for tasks requiring fine-grained visual details.
