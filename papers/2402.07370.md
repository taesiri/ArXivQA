# [SelfSwapper: Self-Supervised Face Swapping via Shape Agnostic Masked   AutoEncoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most prior face swapping methods rely on a "seesaw game" training scheme between reconstruction loss and identity loss. This leads to training instability and target identity leakage in the swapped faces.

Proposed Solution:
- Authors propose a Shape Agnostic Masked Autoencoder (SAMAE) training scheme. This is a self-supervised approach with clear ground truth images for reconstruction.
- Key ideas:
  - Mask facial areas of images during training to prevent identity leakage.
  - Disentangle identity and non-identity features - use separate embeddings.
  - Introduce perforation confusion and random mesh scaling to handle shape misalignment and volume differences between faces.

Contributions:

- Novel SAMAE self-supervised training gets rid of unstable seesaw game in prior works. Addresses target identity leakage effectively.

- Perforation confusion and random mesh scaling enhance cross-identity swapping capability and generalizability. 

- State-of-the-art quality surpassing prior face swapping techniques, in both identity similarity and non-identity attribute preservation, without compromising on either.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative training scheme and techniques to significantly enhance face swapping, setting new state-of-the-art results. The self-supervision provides more stable training and the disentanglement of identity/non-identity features handles target identity leakage effectively.
