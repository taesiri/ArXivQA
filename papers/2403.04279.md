 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Controllable Generation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models: A Survey":

Problem: 
Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled impressive high-fidelity image generation capabilities guided by natural language text prompts. However, relying solely on text conditions does not fully address the diverse and nuanced requirements posed by different applications. Hence, there is a growing need to enhance the controllability of these generative models by introducing additional conditions beyond text.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey focused on reviewing methods that integrate novel conditions into T2I diffusion models to steer the image generation process. The key mechanisms involve either conditional score prediction to directly model the conditional data distribution or condition-guided score estimation to influence the sampling procedure. Based on the type of condition, existing approaches are categorized into generation with specific conditions (e.g. personalization, spatial control), generation with multiple conditions (e.g. joint training, continual learning), and universal controllable generation frameworks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a structured taxonomy to organize controllable generation techniques based on integration of different condition types 
- Provides an in-depth analysis of the theoretical foundations and technical innovations in conditional score prediction and condition-guided score estimation
- Summarizes a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art methods for controllable generation, highlighting their distinct features and capabilities
- Showcases diverse applications across image editing, completion, composition and text-to-3D generation, demonstrating the pivotal impact of conditional generation

In summary, this paper offers extensive technical and practical insights into advancing the control over text-to-image diffusion models using various conditions beyond just text prompts. The comprehensive analysis and perspectives presented contribute significantly towards accelerating progress in this rapidly evolving field.
