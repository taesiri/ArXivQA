# [Semi-parametric Expert Bayesian Network Learning with Gaussian Processes   and Horseshoe Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Expert Bayesian Networks (EBNs) are useful for representing relationships between variables and supporting decision-making. However, experts may face challenges in specifying edges between variables and defining parametric relationships, especially for nonlinear relationships.  

- Existing methods either use EBNs as hard constraints (no modifications allowed) or soft constraints (completely rewrite networks), neither of which is ideal. Semi-parametric Bayesian Networks allow flexibility but don't incorporate expert graphs well.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Semi-parametric Expert Bayesian Network (SEBN) approach that uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) to introduce minimal nonlinear components to an expert graph. 

- A Horseshoe prior is used to penalize excessive GP edges, especially those not present in the original EBN. Differential Horseshoe scales are optimized to prioritize modifying expert edges over adding new ones.

- Parameter learning cotrains linear and GP parameters. Structure learning uses a modified dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently search over structures.

Main Contributions:
- Allows capturing of nuanced nonlinear relationships while largely preserving interpretability of expert graph. Outperforms state-of-the-art Semi-Parametric Bayesian Network.

- Demonstrates the utility of differential Horseshoe priors to prioritize types of edges, maintaining expert structure.

- Provides a spectrum of learned graphs on real-world datasets to address identifiability issues and enhance interpretability when ground truth is unknown.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in developing a flexible approach to incorporate expert knowledge while learning semi-parametric relationships from data. The use of Gaussian Processes and differential regularization enables nuanced modeling without severely disrupting the expert-provided causal graph.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-parametric Bayesian network model that uses Gaussian processes and a horseshoe prior to introduce minimal nonlinear components to an expert Bayesian network, with the goal of extending expert knowledge while preserving interpretability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a model called Semi-parametric Expert Bayesian Network (SEBN) that learns minimal additions to an expert-provided Bayesian network structure to better explain the data, while keeping the learned structure largely consistent with the expert graph. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution are:

- SEBN uses Gaussian processes (GPs) to introduce nonlinear components in the edges of an expert Bayesian network, in order to capture nuanced relationships that may be difficult for experts to specify.

- It uses a Horseshoe prior to regularize the GP amplitudes and penalize excessive GP edges, especially those not present in the original expert graph. This helps preserve the expert structure.

- The paper shows SEBN can learn a minimal set of changes to an expert BN that improve predictive performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, compared to baseline methods.

- By generating graphs with varying levels of regularization when the ground truth is not known, SEBN provides interpretable options for experts that outperform previous state-of-the-art in held-out likelihood.

In summary, the main contribution is the SEBN model that makes minimal expert-guided semi-parametric additions to Bayesian networks to better fit the data while enhancing interpretability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes using Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the non-linear relationships in an expert Bayesian network. Why are GPs well-suited for this task compared to other non-linear modeling techniques? What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using GPs?

2) The paper uses a Horseshoe prior on the GP amplitude parameters to regularize the model. Explain how the Horseshoe prior allows both small and large amplitude values, and why this is useful for determining edge inclusion in the Bayesian network structure. 

3) The paper demonstrates superior performance over the Semi-Parametric Bayesian Network (SPBN) method. What are the key differences between the proposed approach and SPBN that contribute to these performance gains?

4) The Dynamic Programming algorithm for structure learning is adapted to leverage the partial topological order from the expert graph. Explain how this adaptation prunes the search space and provides computational efficiencies. What are some limitations of this approach?

5) On the real-world UCI Liver Disorders dataset, the method provides a range of candidate graphs based on different Horseshoe scale settings. Discuss the tradeoffs between these candidate graphs and how this enhances model interpretability when ground truth is unknown.

6) The paper finds that a two-stage approach of separately learning the linear and non-linear components performs significantly worse than jointly optimizing them. Provide possible explanations for why this joint modeling approach is superior.

7) The paper uses the amplitude and length scale hyperparameters of the GP to determine edge inclusion. Discuss settings of these hyperparameters that may indicate a lack of need for nonlinear components along an edge.

8) The method aligns the linear component of each edge with expert belief while allowing flexibility to model non-linearities. Discuss why this alignment is important for interpretability and acceptance of the learned model.

9) The paper focuses on the fully observed case. What additional complexities arise when extending this approach to handle partially observed data?

10) A limitation mentioned is the high computational cost of the exact structure learning algorithm. Propose some approaches that could help improve the scalability of the overall method to larger Bayesian networks.
