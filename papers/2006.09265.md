# [IsarStep: a Benchmark for High-level Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is limited prior work investigating the capability of neural networks to do mathematical reasoning, with most focusing on simple arithmetic problems.  
- More complex tasks like generating intermediate proof steps require creative thinking, inference, understanding conditions, and symbolic manipulation - abilities neural networks have not demonstrated.
- A well-defined benchmark is needed to measure progress in mathematical reasoning for neural networks.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors build a non-synthetic dataset from a large repository of 204K human-written Isabelle proofs across diverse undergraduate and research-level mathematical topics.
- They define a task called "IsarStep" where models must generate a missing intermediate proposition between two proof steps. This tests key skills needed for automating theorem proving. 
- Several neural sequence-to-sequence models are evaluated: RNN with attention, transformer, and a new hierarchical transformer that explicitly models intra- and inter-proposition reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- The first large-scale benchmark for evaluating neural networks on complex mathematical reasoning, with broad topic coverage and real proofs.
- Analysis showing current neural models can capture non-trivial reasoning, with the hierarchical transformer performing the best.  
- Findings that related concepts have learned embeddings close in vector space, and some models can do multi-step inference rivaling humans.
- A test suite to validate if generated propositions are logically correct using automatic theorem provers.
- The dataset and models to encourage further research progress in this direction.

In summary, this paper makes significant progress towards neural networks that can automatically generate human-readable mathematical proofs. The presented benchmark and analysis set a strong foundation for future work on modelling complex reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a new benchmark dataset and task for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of neural sequence-to-sequence models by having them fill in missing intermediate propositions in proofs mined from a large repository.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Mining a large non-synthetic dataset of formal proofs and proposing a task for evaluating neural models' mathematical reasoning abilities. The dataset contains 820K training examples with a vocabulary size of 30K.

2. Evaluating existing neural sequence-to-sequence models like RNN search, transformer, and convolutional seq2seq models on this mathematical reasoning task. 

3. Introducing a new hierarchical transformer model, which outperforms the baseline models.

4. Providing a comprehensive analysis of what has been learned by the neural models, showing they can learn non-trivial logical relations and mathematical concepts. 

5. Providing a test suite to check the correctness of types and the validity of the generated propositions using automatic theorem provers.

In summary, the key contribution is creating a benchmark for testing machine learning models on high-level mathematical reasoning, along with models that show promising performance on this challenging task. The hope is driving progress towards systems that can automatically generate human-readable proofs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- IsarStep dataset: A non-synthetic dataset of over 200K formally-proved lemmas mined from the Archive of Formal Proofs. Used to benchmark mathematical reasoning capabilities of ML models.

- Intermediate proposition generation task: The core task defined in the paper - given surrounding context in a proof, generate the missing intermediate proposition that helps bridge the gap between steps.

- Sequence-to-sequence models: RNN and transformer models used as baselines, which achieve 15-25% exact match accuracy on the dataset.

- Hierarchical transformer (HAT): A new seq2seq model proposed that uses local layers to encode individual propositions and global layers to model cross-proposition correlations. Outperforms baselines.

- Analysis of reasoning capabilities: Analysis showing models can learn mathematical syntax, concept relationships, set/subset/member relationships, and even complex multi-step reasoning.

- Formal proofs: The proofs in the dataset originate from the Isabelle proof assistant and are mostly written in declarative "human-readable" style.

- Automated theorem proving: One motivation is using strong intermediate proposition generation to reduce search spaces and improve automation of theorem provers.

In summary, key terms cover the IsarStep dataset, intermediate proposition generation task, seq2seq models and analysis, the hierarchical transformer, formal proofs, and connections to automated reasoning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new hierarchical transformer architecture for the proposition synthesis task. How does this model capture mathematical reasoning compared to standard sequence-to-sequence models? What are the key advantages of explicitly modeling local and global dependencies?

2. The dataset is constructed by mining proofs from the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant. What are the benefits and potential limitations of using this formal proof data versus more informal mathematical text?

3. The proof steps in the IsarStep dataset are quite large, spanning undergraduate to research-level content. How does the model's performance vary across proof complexity levels? Are certain domains or proof techniques more challenging?

4. Propositional validity checking using ATPs reveals the model can sometimes generate alternative yet correct intermediate steps. Does analysis of these alternatives provide any insight into the model's reasoning process or limitations?

5. Attention analysis indicates the model learns relationships between mathematical concepts like set membership and subset ordering. Does the model capture other non-trivial logical inferences or type-level reasoning?

6. Error analysis shows incorrect propositions are often plausible yet invalid copies from the context. How might the model be improved to generate more creative, non-duplicative steps?

7. The IsarStep task focuses on single-step inference. How might the approach be extended to tackle longer, multi-step proofs? Would a hierarchical model still be beneficial?

8. Could the proposed method assist in improving automation for interactive theorem provers like Isabelle? What changes would enable more downstream applications?

9. What forms of syntactic or semantic supervision could augment this self-supervised learning approach? Would incorporating type constraints, tactics, etc. be helpful?

10. Mathematical reasoning requires both symbolic manipulation and conceptual understanding. How well does this Seq2Seq method capture each aspect? What modifications could better model symbolic computation?
