# [Tracing the Roots of Facts in Multilingual Language Models: Independent,   Shared, and Transferred Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05189)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Acquiring factual knowledge for low-resource languages is challenging due to limited real-world entity coverage in training data. Cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models (ML-LMs) has been proposed to mitigate this, but it's unclear how factual knowledge is acquired and represented across languages. 

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) The authors evaluate factual probing performance of ML-LMs (mBERT and XLM-R) on the multilingual LAMA (mLAMA) dataset across 53 languages. They find performance differences across languages that are moderately correlated with training data volume, indicating other factors influence cross-lingual transfer as well.

2) Using neuron analysis, the authors identify both language-independent and cross-lingual (shared) factual representations in ML-LMs. They also propose methods to quantify cross-lingual sharing and trace the roots of facts back to training data to identify cross-lingual transferred representations.  

3) Key findings show ML-LMs acquire and represent factual knowledge in three ways - language-independent, cross-lingual (shared), and cross-lingual (transferred). However, analysis reveals limitations in effective cross-lingual transfer of facts from high to low resource languages, highlighting the need for better cross-lingual representation learning.

In summary, this work analyzes how factual knowledge is acquired and represented across languages in ML-LMs. The proposed methods and analysis categorize three types of factual representations and reveal limitations in cross-lingual transfer of facts, providing direction for improving multilingual models.
