# [Parameter-Free Algorithms for Performative Regret Minimization under   Decision-Dependent Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15188)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of performative risk minimization under decision-dependent distributions. This is the setting where the distribution of the stochastic parameters depends on the decision made by the algorithm. For example, a prediction model may influence the data distribution. The goal is to minimize the performative risk which is the expected loss over the decision-dependent distribution. This problem is challenging because the distribution changes with the decision. 

Prior Work Limitations: 
Existing methods have limitations - gradient methods may not find the global optimum, Lipschitz bandit methods require knowing problem parameters like sensitivity and smoothness constants. These limitations motivate designing a practical parameter-free algorithm.

Key Ideas:
- Use the framework of optimistic optimization to search the decision space and estimate the performative risk
- Leverage the idea of performative feedback - deploying a decision reveals its induced distribution -  to refine estimates
- Develop algorithms for full-feedback (entire distribution observed) and data-driven (sample from distribution) settings 

Main Algorithms:
- DOOP: Uses hierarchical partitioning, sequentially evaluates decisions to optimize deterministic estimates of performative risk (full-feedback)  
- SOOP: Extends DOOP to handle stochastic estimates from samples (data-driven), handles noise in estimates

Key Results:
- Develop regret bounds that depend on a novel near-optimality dimension and vanish as the sensitivity parameter goes to 0
- Guarantees hold for possibly non-convex objectives, without needing problem parameters
- Demonstrate superior practical performance over prior methods on non-convex instances

Contributions:
The main contributions are developing a parameter-free optimistic optimization framework for performative risk minimization that works for non-convex objectives, has theoretical guarantees, and strong empirical performance. The algorithms adaptively estimate the performative risk landscape.

In summary, the paper makes significant progress on a challenging stochastic optimization problem arising in machine learning applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops efficient parameter-free optimistic optimization algorithms for minimizing the performative risk under decision-dependent distributions that significantly outperform existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is developing efficient parameter-free algorithms for performative risk minimization. Specifically:

- The paper proposes optimistic optimization-based algorithms called DOOP and SOOP that do not require knowledge of problem parameters like the Lipschitz constants, sensitivity parameter, or Rademacher complexity. This makes the algorithms practical and favorable over existing methods.

- Theoretical guarantees are provided on the optimality gap (simple regret) that show DOOP and SOOP can find an near optimal solution. The bounds exhibit dependence on the near-optimality dimension and vanish as the sensitivity parameter goes to zero.

- Experiments demonstrate DOOP and SOOP outperform existing methods like the Lipschitz bandit-based zooming algorithm, as well as standard optimistic optimization algorithms applied directly without using performative feedback. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

In summary, the main contribution is developing parameter-free and efficient optimistic optimization algorithms for performative risk minimization that have strong theoretic guarantees and excellent empirical performance. The methods are designed to leverage performative feedback in an effective way.

Formal regret bounds are provided in terms of the near-optimality dimension and sensitivity parameter.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method leverage optimistic optimization techniques to minimize the performative risk without requiring knowledge of problem parameters like Lipschitz constants? What specific algorithms, like SequOOL and StroquOOL, inspire the approach?

2. Explain the exploration-exploitation mechanism in Algorithms 1 and 2. How does the algorithm balance testing many cells versus focusing on narrow promising regions as the depth increases? 

3. The paper argues the performative risk optimization problem can be viewed as a type of bandit optimization problem. What unique challenges arise in this bandit optimization setting and how does the method address them?

4. How exactly does the method make use of "performative feedback" when evaluating a solution to help assess other potential solutions? Explain the key ideas here. 

5. Describe how the near-optimality dimension, which relates to zooming dimension, impacts the performance guarantees. How does near-optimality dimension depend on the sensitivity parameter epsilon?

6. Walk through the differences in analysis between the full-feedback and data-driven settings. What additional challenges arise in the data-driven setting and how are these handled?

7. The method does not require knowing the Lipschitz constant L_theta. Explain why performative feedback enables getting around this issue and not needing L_theta in the bounds.

8. What specifically is meant by "low-noise" and "high-noise" regimes? How does the choice of p differ in these regimes?

9. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using the Rademacher complexity to control estimation error. What role does Rademacher complexity play in the analysis?

10. One limitation is the need to assume boundedness of the domain and objective function. Discuss how you might extend the approach to relax these assumptions. What new challenges would arise?
