## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SimCalib: Graph Neural Network Calibration based on Similarity between Nodes":

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive performance on modeling graph data, but can be miscalibrated (overconfident/underconfident predictions). This is problematic for safety-critical applications. Prior work on GNN calibration has lacked theoretical analysis and mainly focused on empirical methods. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a theoretical analysis showing node similarity is important for GNN calibration. It proposes SimCalib, a calibration method exploiting similarity at the global (between node features and class prototypes) and local levels (dynamics of node representations during message-passing).

Key Contributions:

- Theoretical analysis proving calibration error is reduced by jointly optimizing likelihoods of similar nodes 

- Proposes novel mechanisms in SimCalib to capture similarity:

    - Global: Mahalanobis distance between node features and class prototypes

    - Local: Node homophily and relative degree to model representation dynamics  

- Relates oversmoothing problem to miscalibration

- Comprehensive experiments show SimCalib achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 out of 16 benchmarks, reducing error by 10.4% on average over prior best method

- Discovers empirical correlation between similarity and calibration improvement, aligning with theory

- Analysis of data efficiency, model expressivity, ablation studies

In summary, this paper provides theoretical grounding and practical mechanisms for GNN calibration via modeling similarity. The proposed SimCalib method sets the new state-of-the-art through sophisticated use of global and local node similarities.
