# [Directional Antenna Systems for Long-Range Through-Wall Human Activity   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01388)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) can be used for human activity recognition (HAR) to enable contactless, privacy-preserving sensing over long ranges. However, few off-the-shelf WiFi devices provide access to CSI data. The paper explores using low-cost ESP32 microcontrollers for long-range through-wall CSI-based HAR, which has remained largely unexplored.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper evaluates four ESP32-S3 systems with different antenna configurations - the built-in printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA), PIFA with a plane reflector, PIFA with a 90-degree corner reflector, and an external biquad antenna. The systems are deployed 18 meters apart, spanning 5 rooms separated by brick walls, in a challenging non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario.  

Two systems performed the best - the biquad antenna and the PIFA with a plane reflector. They achieved sufficient signal strength for stable connections in both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS settings. CNN-based HAR models were trained on the new Wallhack1.8k dataset collected using these systems.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated feasibility of long-range through-wall HAR using low-cost ESP32 devices with directional antennas
- Proposed and evaluated two high-performing systems - biquad antenna and PIFA with plane reflector
- Created and released Wallhack1.8k, a multi-system dataset of 1806 CSI spectrograms for benchmarking WiFi-based HAR
- NLOS HAR accuracy of 92.0+/-3.5% achieved with the biquad antenna system over 18 meters and 5 rooms

The results show that the proposed ESP32-based systems can enable accurate long-range sensing of human activities through walls, advancing privacy-preserving HAR technology. The publicly released dataset facilitates further progress in this emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes and evaluates two ESP32-S3-based directional antenna systems, one using a biquad antenna and one using the built-in PIFA with a plane reflector, for long-range through-wall human activity recognition, achieving over 90% accuracy across 18 meters and 5 rooms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing and evaluating two promising systems for long-range through-wall human activity recognition using the ESP32-S3: a biquad antenna system and a system combining the ESP32-S3's built-in PIFA antenna with a plane reflector.

2) Creating a new benchmark dataset called Wallhack1.8k comprising 1806 CSI amplitude spectrograms of human activities collected in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios spanning five rooms and a distance of 18 meters. This dataset is made publicly available. 

3) Training CNN-based activity recognition models on the Wallhack1.8k dataset to demonstrate the feasibility of long-range through-wall human activity recognition. The biquad antenna system achieved the best accuracy of 92.0+/-3.5% on the core non-line-of-sight activity recognition task.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing and evaluating ESP32-S3 based systems for long-range through-wall HAR, creating a new public benchmark dataset, and demonstrating state-of-the-art through-wall HAR accuracy with the proposed biquad antenna system.

The paper explores long-range through-wall human activity recognition using WiFi channel state information captured with different antenna configurations of ESP32 devices. It evaluates the performance in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions using external biquad antennas and the built-in PIFA antenna with reflectors. The collected dataset of CSI spectrograms is used to train CNN models for activity recognition. So the main focus is on HAR, WiFi CSI, through-wall sensing, directional antennas, LOS vs NLOS conditions, and use of ESP32 devices.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper explores multiple antenna configurations for the ESP32-S3 to enable long-range through-wall human activity recognition. What were the key considerations and trade-offs in selecting an appropriate antenna design? 

2. The biquad antenna system demonstrated superior performance compared to the other systems. What are the theoretical reasons behind this? How do parameters like antenna gain, beamwidth, side lobe suppression, etc. contribute to its effectiveness?

3. The paper argues that the biquad antenna's 70-degree beamwidth provides a good balance between directionality and room coverage. How was this angle selected? What impact would a narrower or wider beamwidth have on the system's performance? 

4. The biquad antenna was constructed from copper PCB and wires. What alternative materials could be used? Would different construction materials impact the antenna characteristics and recognition accuracy?

5. The paper uses CSI amplitude information for activity recognition. Would using CSI phase or a combination of amplitude/phase lead to better recognition performance? What challenges need to be addressed in using CSI phase?

6. What other antenna types besides the biquad could be suitable for this through-wall sensing application (e.g. Yagi-Uda, helical, etc.)? What would be their relative advantages and disadvantages?

7. The activity recognition models were trained on data collected at specific distances. How would the models generalize to intermediate distances between those used for training data collection?  

8. What impact would the wall thickness and material have on the proposed system's performance? How could the system be adapted to different wall characteristics?

9. The paper uses ESP-NOW for communication between the transmitter and receiver. What alternative WiFi communication protocols could be used and what would be their trade-offs?  

10. The system was evaluated in an office environment. How would performance differ in a home environment with different room sizes, layouts, construction materials, and furniture? How could the system be optimized for a home setting?
