# [CLIPTrans: Transferring Visual Knowledge with Pre-trained Models for   Multimodal Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15226)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis is that existing pre-trained language models and multimodal models can be effectively combined and adapted to improve multimodal machine translation, without needing to train complex specialized models from scratch. Specifically, the paper proposes combining the mBART text translation model and the multilingual multimodal CLIP (M-CLIP) model in a novel way to improve MMT. The key ideas are:- Using M-CLIP to provide visual features/representations to augment the text-only mBART model for MMT. This transfers visual knowledge to mBART without needing paired image-text multilingual training data.- Proposing a two-stage training approach where first image captioning is used to adapt mBART to the visual representations before MMT. The idea is captioning helps align the modalities.- Simply conditioning mBART on M-CLIP visual features via a lightweight mapping network and prefix tokens, eliminating the need for complex fused architectures.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging and aligning pre-trained vision and language models through this proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art MMT performance, without requiring difficult joint training or fusion of specialized MMT models. The experiments aim to demonstrate these advantages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Presenting an architecture called CLIPTrans that simplifies multimodal machine translation by transferring knowledge from independently pre-trained multimodal and multilingual models (M-CLIP and mBART), without requiring heavily engineered architectures or additional data.2. Proposing a novel two-stage training pipeline where the first stage is image-to-text captioning and the second stage is text-to-text translation.

Setting strong text-only baselines with mBART that exceed previous MMT state-of-the-art results. This shows the power of transfer learning from pre-trained models.5. Providing thorough ablation studies and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training pipeline and architecture design choices.In summary, the main contribution is presenting a simple yet effective approach to transfer knowledge from pre-trained vision-language and language-only models for multimodal machine translation, using a novel training strategy. The method achieves new state-of-the-art results while simplifying the MMT pipeline.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes CLIPTrans, a method for multimodal machine translation which adapts independently pre-trained multilingual text (mBART) and multimodal vision-language (M-CLIP) models by using a novel two-stage training approach involving image captioning and then translation to enable transferring visual knowledge without images during inference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are a few key points comparing this work to other research in multimodal machine translation:- The paper proposes a new method called CLIPTrans that utilizes off-the-shelf pretrained models - M-CLIP for multimodal encoding and mBART for sequence generation. This contrasts with most prior MMT works that design specialized model architectures and objectives for aligning vision and language. - Rather than training an end-to-end MMT model from scratch, CLIPTrans uses a simple 2-stage training approach. The first stage pre-trains on image captioning before fine-tuning on translation. This allows transferring visual knowledge to language without needing aligned multimodal multilingual data.- The paper shows strong performance, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods on MMT benchmarks like Multi30K and WIT by 2-3 BLEU points on average. The gains are especially pronounced for low-resource languages.- CLIPTrans does not require images during inference, relying only on text. Many previous MMT models depend on images at test time. This expands the applicability of CLIPTrans.- The visual grounding from CLIP is transferred via a lightweight mapping network that creates prefix embeddings for mBART. This avoids complex fusion techniques like multi-modal attention.Overall, the simplicity of CLIPTrans compared to specialized MMT architectures, its use of off-the-shelf models via clever pre-training, and strong results validate its usefulness. The gains on low-resource language pairs are also an important contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring the use of unsupervised data during training to further push the domain forward and reduce reliance on current small-scale datasets. The authors note their method is flexible enough to enable use of existing large-scale datasets for training via cross-lingual transfer approaches. This could help alleviate the data scarcity issue.- Applying the approach to other multilingual sequence generation tasks that can benefit from visual grounding, beyond just machine translation. The authors frame their contribution more broadly as a method to enable multimodal multilingual generation.- Trying the approach on smaller or distilled versions of the models used. The authors acknowledge the computational expense of larger pretrained models and suggest their method could be adapted to smaller models.- Extending the approach to more languages, since currently it is limited to the languages covered by the pretrained M-CLIP and mBART models. Techniques like zero-shot cross-lingual transfer could help expand language coverage.- Continued work to mitigate dataset and societal biases in vision-language models that the authors acknowledge could be present in their approach.- Further analysis and experiments on the image captioning stage to better understand its role and impact on alignment and adaptation of the models.In summary, the key future directions relate to expanding the approach to more data, tasks, languages, and model sizes, while continuing to address biases and analyze the underlying mechanisms enabling the transfer learning. The authors position their work as simplifying MMT and enabling new directions by using pretrained models more effectively.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:Paragraph 1:This paper proposes CLIPTrans, a method for leveraging pre-trained multimodal and multilingual models for multimodal machine translation (MMT). Specifically, they utilize M-CLIP, a multilingual variant of CLIP that aligns vision and language representations, along with mBART, a multilingual text-to-text transformer model. Rather than designing complex MMT architectures, they propose a simple framework where M-CLIP image features are mapped to a prefix sequence for the mBART decoder using a lightweight feedforward network. This aligns the embedding spaces of the two models. They employ a two-stage training pipeline where stage 1 trains the framework on image captioning, and stage 2 trains on translation, which mimics MMT dataset annotation procedures. This enables transferring visual knowledge to multilingual text generation without images at test time. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on MMT benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by 2.67-3.64 BLEU on average. The key advantage is simplifying MMT by capitalizing on independently pre-trained models.Paragraph 2: The paper provides extensive analysis and ablation studies. They demonstrate the importance of the two-stage training, particularly the image captioning stage for adapting attention maps and aligning embeddings. Comparisons to strong mBART baselines validate the benefit of fusing M-CLIP features. Additional experiments analyze robustness to noisy inputs, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and variations in training schemes. Qualitative results illustrate the model's ability to generate coherent captions and translations from the M-CLIP prefixes. Limitations include computational cost of larger models and reliance on pre-training data languages. Overall, the method simplifies MMT by avoiding complex objectives or architectures previously needed for vision-language alignment and instead capitalizes on transfer learning abilities of current multimodal multilingual models. The framework and training pipeline offer a generalized approach for multimodal multilingual sequence generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes CLIPTrans, a method for multimodal machine translation that leverages independent pre-trained models - the multilingual multimodal M-CLIP and the multilingual text-only mBART. The key idea is to transfer visual knowledge from M-CLIP to mBART through a two-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, M-CLIP image features are mapped to a visual context via a lightweight mapping network and used as decoder prefixes to train mBART on an image captioning task. This aligns the mBART decoder with visual representations. In the second stage, the M-CLIP text encoder is used instead to generate decoder prefixes from source text, and mBART is trained on translation. This transfers the visual knowledge to the textual modality, eliminating the need for images during inference. The two-stage approach and use of independently pre-trained modules simplifies training and provides gains over previous specialized MMT architectures. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on Multi30K and WIT benchmarks by effectively leveraging M-CLIP and mBART.
