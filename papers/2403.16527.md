# [Hallucination Detection in Foundation Models for Decision-Making: A   Flexible Definition and Review of the State of the Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16527)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of using foundation models for decision-making tasks and methods for detecting and mitigating hallucinations from these models. 

Foundation models refer to large language models that are pre-trained on diverse datasets and can be adapted to various downstream tasks. Recently, researchers have explored using these models for decision-making in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and gaming. However, a key challenge is that foundation models tend to "hallucinate" - generate plausible but incorrect or irrelevant outputs. 

The paper first discusses examples of foundation models being used for decision-making, such as path planning for autonomous vehicles or generating robot control programs. Several cases of hallucinations are highlighted, like a model failing to detect traffic light states or attempting to interact with non-existent objects.

A flexible definition of hallucinations is then proposed - outputs that conflict with constraints or desired behavior for the task, are irrelevant, but may seem plausible. The definition allows for specifying metrics like consistency, relevancy, and plausibility based on the deployment.  

The paper taxonomizes approaches for detecting and mitigating hallucinations based on assumptions on model access - white-box (model states), grey-box (token probabilities), and black-box. Examples of techniques are analyzing attention patterns, confidence estimation, constraint satisfaction, and adversarial prompting. 

Evaluation metrics, datasets, and simulators for assessing hallucination detection are also summarized. Most techniques are evaluated on QA tasks and few on decision systems, suggesting an area for future work. The paper concludes by discussing open challenges like developing more black-box methods, testing generalization via adversarial inputs, and evaluating multi-modal models.

Overall, the paper clearly defines the problem of hallucinations from foundation models for decision-making, comprehensively reviews the state of the art, and provides directions for advancing research in this critical area.
