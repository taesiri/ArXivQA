# [AED: Adaptable Error Detection for Few-shot Imitation Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03860)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Few-shot imitation (FSI) policies learn to imitate expert demonstrations and perform tasks in novel environments. However, they can potentially cause damage if behavior errors occur undetected. 
- Existing error detection methods face challenges in detecting errors of FSI policies: (1) Errors need to be detected in unseen environments. (2) No obvious changes reveal when errors happen. (3) Online detection is required to terminate policies timely.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulates a new task called "adaptable error detection (AED)" to monitor FSI policies and detect their behavior errors.
- Proposes a benchmark with 7 robot manipulation tasks across over 400 simulated environments.
- Introduces "Pattern Observer (PrObe)", an algorithm that extracts discriminative features from policy representations to detect error patterns. Main components:
   - Pattern extractor: learns sparse patterns that reveal changes easily.
   - Flow generator: generates pattern sequence of policy's state. 
   - Embedding fusion: compares consistency between pattern flow and demonstrations.
- Optimized using classification loss, sparsity loss and novel temporal-aware contrastive loss.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the novel and important AED task to accelerate FSI policy development.
- Constructs a comprehensive AED benchmark and proposes PrObe method.
- PrObe outperforms strong baselines by large margins. It works robustly across policies and tasks.
- Thorough experiments validate effectiveness and practicality of PrObe and the AED task.
- Lays an essential foundation for future FSI research and real-world deployment.

In summary, this paper identifies the crucial AED task to safely monitor FSI policies. To address this challenging problem, the authors contribute a tailored benchmark, method and comprehensive analyses. The paper delivers significant impact that can catalyze advancing FSI research.
