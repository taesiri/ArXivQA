# [RIS-empowered Topology Control for Distributed Learning in Urban Air   Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05133)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles like flying cars need comprehensive scene perception for safe autonomous aerial driving. This requires high perception learning capabilities. 
- However, UAM vehicles have limited onboard sensors and computing resources, making it challenging to conduct deep learning for perception tasks. 
- Existing collaborative learning approaches like federated learning rely on a central server for model aggregation, which is difficult to maintain in dynamic UAM environments. Fully decentralized schemes may not guarantee learning convergence.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to empower distributed federated learning for UAM vehicles. 
- It introduces topology optimization criteria to generate a communication network graph that ensures fast convergence of distributed learning and reduces transmission delays.
- An innovative RIS-based topology control method is proposed that constructs/deconstructs links to reshape the network according to the optimization criteria and accommodate transmission rates.
- A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm optimizes the RIS phase shifts to achieve desired transmission rates on each link simultaneously.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes network topology optimization criteria for distributed federated learning convergence: minimize maximum eigenvalue and maximize second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix.
- First work to leverage RIS abilities for communication network layer optimization instead of just physical layer signal enhancement.
- Develops RIS-empowered topology control framework to construct/deconstruct links based on proposed criteria and transmission rates.
- Designs DDPG method to optimize RIS phase shifts for simultaneous rate control of all links.
- Verifies performance gain over benchmarks on Multi-View MobileNet learning for UAM scene perception.

In summary, the key novelty is using RIS-empowered topology optimization to enable efficient distributed collaborative learning for resource-constrained UAM vehicles.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a RIS-empowered topological control scheme to improve the convergence and learning performance of distributed federated learning for resource-limited devices in urban air mobility by leveraging the link construction and deconstruction capabilities of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces to reshape the communication network topology according to proposed topological criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes several topological criteria to optimize the communication network topology for distributed federated learning (FL) convergence and performance. Specifically, it aims to minimize the largest eigenvalue and maximize the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the network. This facilitates distributed FL convergence while reducing communication overhead.

2. It designs a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered topology optimization scheme that utilizes the link construction and deconstruction abilities of RIS to reshape the communication network according to the proposed topological criteria and transmission rate requirements. 

3. It develops a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based RIS phase shift control algorithm to optimize the RIS configuration for constructing desired links and deconstructing undesired links simultaneously in order to attain the transmission rates required by the topological criteria.

4. It verifies the efficiency of the proposed distributed FL framework and RIS-based topology optimization scheme through MobileNet-based multi-view distributed learning experiments. The results demonstrate improved learning performance and convergence compared to other FL schemes.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an innovative RIS-empowered topology control framework to facilitate efficient distributed federated learning convergence and performance for resource-constrained aerial vehicles. The topology optimization accounts for both learning convergence guarantees and communication overhead reduction.
