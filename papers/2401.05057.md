# [BoundMPC: Cartesian Trajectory Planning with Error Bounds based on Model   Predictive Control in the Joint Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05057)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of online trajectory planning for robotic manipulators required to follow Cartesian reference paths in position and orientation while respecting constraints such as collisions, via-points, and asymmetric error bounds. Planning optimal and feasible trajectories in real-time for changing environments and goals is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel model predictive control (MPC) based framework called BoundMPC for online trajectory optimization in joint space to follow the Cartesian references paths. The key aspects are:

- Decomposition of Cartesian errors into tangential (path progress) and orthogonal components which are further projected onto basis vectors to allow asymmetric bounding. This is done for both position and orientation errors using Lie theory.

- Use of piecewise linear reference paths with via-points that are easy to replan online and lead to an efficient optimization problem formulation.

- Systematic bounding of orthogonal Cartesian errors, individually in the basis directions, to incorporate constraints like collisions and synchronization needs.

- Online replanning handling to adapt trajectories during motion by reusing previous solutions.


Main Contributions:

- A flexible trajectory optimization framework for manipulators that allows symmetric and asymmetric bounding of Cartesian errors.

- Novel orientation error decomposition and bounding using Lie theory.

- Efficient online replanning of piecewise linear position and orientation reference paths.

- Demonstrated performance for two real robotic tasks - 1) object transfer through slit requiring orientation control. 2) grasping with changed target and collision avoidance.

- Systematic use of via-points, error decomposition and bounding enables meeting constraints like collisions and synchronization in an intuitive Cartesian space.

In summary, the paper presents a novel online trajectory optimization framework BoundMPC that plans optimal joint space trajectories for manipulators to follow Cartesian reference paths using error decomposition and bounding. Replanning capabilities make it suitable for dynamic environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel model-predictive trajectory planning framework called BoundMPC that allows robots to follow Cartesian position and orientation reference paths with synchronized via-points while respecting asymmetric error bounds, enabling online replanning for dynamically changing environments and goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A path-following MPC framework to follow position and orientation paths with synchronized via-points is developed. The robot kinematics are considered in the optimization problem such that the joint inputs are optimized while adhering to (asymmetric) Cartesian constraints.

2. The orientation is represented using the Lie theory for rotations to allow an efficient decomposition and bounding of the orientation errors. 

3. Piecewise linear position and orientation reference paths with via-points can be replanned online to quickly react to dynamically changing environments and new goals during the robot's motion.

4. The framework is demonstrated on a 7-DoF Kuka LBR iiwa 14 manipulator with planning times less than 100ms. Two distinct scenarios are shown - transferring a large object through a confined space with obstacles, and grasping an object from a table with a changing grasp point while avoiding collisions.

In summary, the main contribution is a flexible and efficient model predictive control framework for robotic manipulators that can follow Cartesian position and orientation paths with error bounds and via-points, and allows for real-time replanning to adapt to dynamic situations. The orientation error decomposition and asymmetric bounding are also novel aspects.

The paper proposes a model-predictive trajectory planning framework called "BoundMPC" for following Cartesian reference paths with robotic manipulators. It allows specifying via-points and decomposes the errors into tangential (progress along path) and orthogonal components, with the ability to specify asymmetric bounds on the orthogonal errors. It also represents orientations using Lie algebra and linearizes their propagation. A key aspect is the ability to replan trajectories online to adapt to dynamic changes. Some experimental scenarios like object transfer and grasping are demonstrated to highlight the flexibility of the proposed approach.
