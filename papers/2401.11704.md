# [EK-Net:Real-time Scene Text Detection with Expand Kernel Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11704)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing scene text detection methods that use a text kernel decomposition strategy suffer from a problem called "shrinked kernel", where the detected text boundaries are overly biased towards the text kernel, resulting in decreased accuracy. This is because these methods overly focus on the text kernel as the key component for pixel aggregation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new method called Expand Kernel Network (EK-Net) to address this problem. EK-Net uses a three-stage regression approach to detect arbitrary shaped scene text:

1) Predict a text kernel map, a threshold map, and an expand distance map from the input image using a CNN backbone and FPN. 

2) Combine the kernel and threshold maps to form rough text instances. 

3) Expand the text instances outwards using the expand distance map to compensate for the shrinked kernel problem.

The expand distance map stores the distance of pixels surrounding the text instance to the nearest text kernel. Expanding based on this distance map forces the expansion of text instances and avoids the shrinked kernel problem.

Main Contributions:

- Identifies the shrinked kernel problem in existing kernel based scene text detection methods which causes reduced accuracy.

- Proposes a three-stage regression approach using an expand distance map to compensate for shrinked kernels.

- Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on ICDAR 2015 and CTW1500 datasets, with high FPS, demonstrating a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

- Visualization and experiments demonstrate EK-Net's ability to solve the shrinked kernel problem.

In summary, EK-Net addresses the shrinked kernel issue in prior arts by proposing a three-stage expansion process guided by an expand distance map, allowing more accurate arbitrary shaped text detection with high efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new scene text detection method called Expand Kernel Network (EK-Net) which uses a three-stage regression approach to accurately detect arbitrary-shaped text while achieving real-time performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new scene text detection method called Expand Kernel Network (EK-Net) to address the "shrinked kernel" issue in existing kernel-based methods. Specifically:

1) The paper identifies a deficiency in existing kernel-based scene text detection methods where the detected text instances tend to shrink towards the text kernel, decreasing detection accuracy. This is termed the "shrinked kernel" issue. 

2) To compensate for this issue, the paper proposes EK-Net which includes three stages of regression to detect text instances: predicting the text kernel, threshold map, and expand distance map. The expand distance map allows expanding the initial text kernel outwards to reconstruct the full text instance.

3) Experiments show EK-Net achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on standard scene text detection benchmarks ICDAR 2015 and CTW1500. It also exhibits a good trade-off between accuracy and speed.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the novel EK-Net method to address the identified "shrinked kernel" issue and advance the state-of-the-art in scene text detection. The three stages regression and use of the expand distance map are the main technical novelty.

The paper proposes a new method called Expand Kernel Network (EK-Net) for detecting arbitrary shaped scene text in real-time. It uses a three-stages regression approach to generate a kernel map, threshold map, and expand distance map. A key contribution is addressing limitations of previous kernel-based methods that can cause a "shrinked kernel" issue.
