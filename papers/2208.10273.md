# [Long-Short History of Gradients is All You Need: Detecting Malicious and   Unreliable Clients in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10273)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is:

How to identify and differentiate malicious and unreliable clients, as well as targeted and untargeted attacks, in federated learning?

The key hypothesis is that by using long-short history of gradients jointly with appropriate distance/similarity metrics, the server can distinguish between different types of clients and attacks during the iterative model updating process in federated learning.

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called MUD-HoG that aims to:

- Detect both malicious attackers and unreliable clients with low-quality data in federated learning, unlike prior works that only consider attackers.

- Distinguish between targeted and untargeted attacks among the detected malicious clients.

- Treat unreliable clients differently from malicious ones by still exploiting their contributions to improve model diversity. 

- Consider a mixture of attack types - untargeted (additive noise, sign flipping) and targeted (label flipping, multi-label flipping) attacks.

- Handle the more realistic but challenging case of non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data among clients.

So in summary, the key research question is how to perform fine-grained detection and differentiation of different types of clients and attacks in federated learning using the history of gradients, which the proposed MUD-HoG approach aims to address.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new defense method called MUD-HoG to detect malicious and unreliable clients in federated learning. The key contributions are:

- It distinguishes between malicious clients (who perform targeted or untargeted attacks) and unreliable clients (who have low-quality data) in federated learning. Most prior works only consider malicious clients.

- It introduces two new notions - short history of gradients (HoG) and long HoG - to capture clients' behaviors over multiple rounds. Using appropriate distance/similarity metrics on short and long HoG, it identifies different types of attacks and clients.

- It excludes malicious contributions but still exploits unreliable clients' updates (after downscaling) to improve the global model, unlike works that simply discard unreliable clients. 

- It handles a mixture of multiple attack types - sign flipping, noise injection, label flipping, multi-label flipping - in non-IID settings with up to 47.5% of clients being malicious.

- It comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and detection ratio on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

In summary, the key novelty is a robust framework that provides fine-grained differentiation of clients and attacks in federated learning using long-short history of gradients, which has not been done before. This allows better exploitation of unreliable clients while successfully defending against strong adversarial attacks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new defense method called MUD-HoG that uses long-short history of gradients to detect and differentiate between malicious attackers and unreliable clients with non-IID data in federated learning, and excludes attackers while still utilizing unreliable clients.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related work in defending against attacks in federated learning:

- This paper proposes a new approach called MUD-HoG that aims to detect both malicious clients (attackers) as well as unreliable clients in federated learning. Most prior work has focused only on detecting attackers, overlooking the unreliable clients who may have low-quality but still useful data.  

- The paper considers both untargeted attacks (e.g. sign-flipping, additive noise) as well as targeted attacks (e.g. label flipping). Many existing defenses handle only one type of attack. The proposed approach is able to distinguish between targeted and untargeted attacks among the detected malicious clients.

- The defense uses novel concepts of "short history of gradients (HoG)" and "long HoG" together with suitable similarity measures to identify different types of attacks and clients in a sequential manner. This allows finer-grained detection and handling of different clients. Many prior works do not differentiate between client types.

- The approach is evaluated in non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) settings which are more realistic but also more challenging compared to IID settings assumed in some prior work like Krum, Bulyan, Median, etc. 

- Experiments show the proposed MUD-HoG achieves higher accuracy and can withstand a large fraction of malicious clients (up to 47.5%) with negligible drop in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines like FoolsGold, MKrum, etc. Many existing works degrade significantly with increasing attacks.

- The detection and mitigation happen concurrently during federated learning without needing a separate offline phase. Some prior works like Li et al. require pre-trained reference models.

Overall, the key novelty of this work lies in its ability to detect fine-grained client types including unreliable clients, in realistic heterogeneous settings with both targeted and untargeted attacks. The results demonstrate improved robustness over existing defenses.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate more challenging and dynamic settings where attackers may vary attack types and clients may even switch roles (attackers, unreliable, normal, etc.) over time. Conduct more extensive experiments in these settings to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach.

- Incorporate a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence for the proposed MUD-HoG approach. The paper currently shows empirically that the loss stabilizes over the training rounds indicating convergence, but a formal convergence proof is missing. 

- Defend against more advanced/stealthy targeted attacks like backdoor attacks where the attacker embeds a trigger pattern into the data to cause targeted misclassification. The authors mention that the current MUD-HoG design does not specifically handle such backdoor attacks.

- Consider scenarios where the attackers have knowledge of the defense strategy and can adaptively change their attack strategy. Evaluate if the proposed approach can still detect such adaptive attackers.

- Explore ways to further improve the detection ratio, especially for the targeted attacks. The results show targeted attackers are detected slightly later than untargeted ones.

- Analyze the sensitivity of the hyper-parameters used in MUD-HoG like the sliding window size, earliest detection round, etc. and provide guidelines on setting them.

- Evaluate the proposed approach on more complex and larger datasets like ImageNet to verify its scalability.

- Compare against a wider range of attacks and defense baselines to thoroughly benchmark the performance.

In summary, the authors suggest enhancements to handle more advanced attack scenarios, improve detection performance, analyze convergence theoretically, and conduct more extensive evaluations as future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new defense method called MUD-HoG (Malicious and Unreliable Client Detection using History of Gradients) to detect different types of adversarial clients and reliably aggregate model updates in federated learning. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce two new notions of gradients history - short history of gradients (HoG) and long HoG. Short HoG captures single-round randomness while long HoG reflects the accumulated influence of a client on the global model. 

2) Use a sequential strategy leveraging short and long HoG with selected distance/similarity metrics to detect four types of clients: untargeted attackers, targeted attackers, unreliable clients, and normal clients. Specifically, untargeted attacks are detected using short HoG with cosine distance and clustering; targeted attacks are identified using long HoG with k-means clustering. Unreliable clients are separated from normal clients using short HoG and cosine distance.

3) Aggregate updates only from detected normal clients, while still exploiting useful updates from unreliable clients. The proposed MUD-HoG is evaluated on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets and shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in defending against four attack types and unreliable clients.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution are using long-short gradients history in a sequential manner with tailored metrics to distinguish between four types of clients, which has not been done before yet is critical for handling realistic heterogeneous federated learning settings.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new defense method called MUD-HoG for detecting malicious and unreliable clients in federated learning (FL). FL allows training machine learning models across distributed devices without sharing their data. However, some devices may be unreliable with low-quality data or malicious by sending corrupted model updates. The key idea in MUD-HoG is using a client's long-short history of gradients (HoG) to identify different types of unreliable and malicious behaviors. Specifically, short HoG captures randomness while long HoG captures the accumulated influence on the global model. 

MUD-HoG employs appropriate distance metrics on short and long HoG to sequentially detect four types of clients: untargeted attackers, targeted attackers, unreliable clients, and normal clients. It excludes malicious contributions while still exploiting unreliable clients. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets under non-IID settings demonstrate that MUD-HoG defeats four attack types and outperforms six state-of-the-art methods. It maintains high accuracy and detects up to 47.5% malicious clients and 10% unreliable clients. MUD-HoG is the first work distinguishing all four client types in a practical FL system.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new defense method called MUD-HoG (Malicious and Unreliable Client Detection using History of Gradients) to detect different types of attacks and unreliable clients in federated learning (FL). The key idea is to leverage two notions of gradient history - short history of gradients (HoG) which is a moving average of recent gradients, and long HoG which is the cumulative sum of all past gradients of a client. Using judiciously chosen distance/similarity metrics on the short and long HoG, the method detects four types of clients sequentially: untargeted attackers, targeted attackers, unreliable clients, and normal clients. Specifically, untargeted attackers are detected using cosine distance on short HoG, targeted attackers using K-means clustering on long HoG, and unreliable clients using another round of cosine distance on short HoG after excluding the detected attackers. The aggregation at the server excludes gradients from attackers while still exploiting unreliable clients' updates with a downweighting factor. This allows the method to defend against a heterogeneous mix of untargeted attacks (sign-flipping, additive noise), targeted attacks (label flipping, multi-label flipping), and unreliable clients, in a non-IID setting. Experiments show it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and malicious client detection.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of detecting and defending against malicious and unreliable clients in federated learning (FL). Some key aspects:

- FL allows training machine learning models in a distributed manner across many clients, without centralizing their data. However, this makes the system vulnerable to attacks by malicious clients. 

- Existing work has focused mainly on detecting malicious clients launching untargeted attacks (to degrade overall model performance) or targeted attacks (to decrease performance on some specific cases). 

- However, there is another category of "unreliable" clients that are overlooked - these clients have some low quality or noisy data but are still benign and useful. Treating them as malicious is not ideal.

- The paper aims to develop a method that can perform "three-fold differentiation" - reliably detect and differentiate between malicious clients (with different attack types) and unreliable clients in federated learning. This is more challenging than just detecting malicious clients.

- The key idea is to use a novel approach of jointly exploiting "long-short history of gradients" from clients along with suitable metrics, to identify different types of clients over the iterative training process.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution is in performing fine-grained differentiation between malicious clients (with targeted vs untargeted attacks) and unreliable clients, which has not been addressed effectively in prior work. This allows the server to treat them differently and maximize utility.
