# [Painting 3D Nature in 2D: View Synthesis of Natural Scenes from a Single   Semantic Mask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07224)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to synthesize multi-view consistent color images of natural scenes given only a single semantic mask as input. The key challenges are:1. Existing semantic image synthesis models like SPADE can only generate 2D images and do not consider novel view synthesis.2. Existing view synthesis methods using neural radiance fields require multi-view supervision, which is hard to obtain for natural scenes.3. Single-view view synthesis methods require category-specific priors and only work in limited viewing ranges.To tackle these challenges, the key idea proposed in this paper is:1. Use a semantic field as an intermediate 3D representation, which is easier to reconstruct from an input semantic mask.2. Translate the semantic field to a radiance field with the help of 2D semantic image synthesis models like SPADE. 3. Learn priors for natural scenes from single-view Internet photo collections, without needing multi-view supervision.In summary, the paper aims to address the problem of generating multi-view consistent photo-realistic renderings of natural scenes given just a single semantic mask, using only single-view photos for training. The key innovation is the use of a semantic field to bridge 2D semantic synthesis and 3D neural rendering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A novel framework for view synthesis of natural scenes from a single semantic mask, with only single Internet photos needed for training. This removes the constraint of requiring multi-view or posed training data. 2. The key idea of using a semantic field as an intermediate 3D representation, which is easier to reconstruct from an input 2D semantic mask compared to directly recovering a full radiance field. The semantic field helps enable multi-view consistent novel view synthesis.3. The proposed two-stage approach of first generating multi-view semantic masks and then translating them to RGB images via an image synthesis model. This decomposes the difficult problem into two simpler sub-problems.4. Introduction of a semantic neural field that fuses and denoises the generated multi-view semantic masks for better consistency. This addresses artifacts caused by inconsistencies.5. Experimental results that demonstrate the proposed method outperforms baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively on the task of semantics-guided view synthesis for natural scenes.In summary, the main contribution is a new framework and techniques for generating 3D representations and photorealistic novel views from a single 2D semantic mask input, trained only using widely available single-view image collections rather than multi-view supervision. The key ideas are using a semantic field representation and a two-stage generation process.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework to synthesize photorealistic, multi-view consistent videos of natural scenes from a single input semantic mask, by first reconstructing a 3D semantic field from the mask and then translating it to a radiance field using pretrained semantic image generators like SPADE.
