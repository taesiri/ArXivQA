# [CPN: Complementary Proposal Network for Unconstrained Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11540)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing scene text detection methods follow two paradigms - segmentation-based and anchor-based. Both have limitations in detecting texts of arbitrary shapes and complex layouts.  
- Segmentation-based methods struggle with compact and overlapping text layouts. 
- Anchor-based methods have difficulties with irregular text shapes and large aspect ratios.

Proposed Solution: 
- A Complementary Proposal Network (CPN) that integrates the strengths of segmentation-based and anchor-based approaches to overcome their weaknesses.

Key Components of CPN:
- Deformable Morphology Semantic Network: Generates semantic proposals using deformable morphological operators and dilation layers. Captures high-level semantic information.
- Balanced Region Proposal Network: Produces geometric proposals using predefined anchors. Captures low-level geometric structure of texts. 
- Interleaved Feature Attention Module: Enables interaction between semantic and geometric features before proposal generation. Further enhances complementarity.

Main Contributions:
- First study to integrate two distinct proposal paradigms for text detection.
- Deformable MSN with GPU parallelizable operations for efficient semantic proposals.
- Interleaved Feature Attention module for feature interaction and computation reduction.
- State-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with significant margins. 3.6% gain on ICDAR 2019 ArT.

The proposed CPN effectively combines complementary semantic and geometric information to accurately detect texts of varied shapes, scales and layouts.
