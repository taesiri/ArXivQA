# [Towards Understanding Underwater Weather Events in Rivers Using   Autonomous Surface Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14248)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extreme weather events and climate change are increasing the frequency and severity of floods, altering river hydrology and sediment transport. This impacts river health, causes erosion, and resuspends contaminated sediments.
- There is a lack of spatial and temporal data on the complex underwater dynamics occurring during these events due to an inability to visually observe them and limitations of stationary/aerial sensors.

Proposed Solution:  
- Deploy autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) equipped with sensor suites to map and track changes in physical/chemical parameters, bathymetry, and sediment transport before/after extreme weather.

Methods:
- Custom lightweight ASV with pH, temperature, nitrate, pressure sensors, and LISST-ABS sediment sensor.
- Clearpath Heron ASV with high-precision RTK GPS and bathymetry sensor.
- Surveys along lawn-mower patterns on Schuylkill River in Philadelphia during high and low tides.

Results:
- Mapped 2D riverbed indicating asymmetry. 
- Trends exist between tidal conditions but limited variability over small spatial scale.
- Temperature, nitrate and chlorophyll correlations match expectations.

Contributions:
- First ASV-based surveys of sediment and water dynamics on the Schuylkill River.
- Preliminary data to improve understanding of floods, mixing zones, bathymetry changes, and sediment resuspension. 
- Basis for long-term monitoring of annual sediment/hydrology cycles.
- Data to develop adaptive sampling strategies for efficient information gain.

In summary, this paper presents an initial demonstration of using autonomous surface vehicles to study the complex underwater dynamics in rivers that are intensified by extreme weather events. The high-resolution spatial and temporal data will enable better modeling and prediction to improve river health.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Autonomous surface vehicles equipped with sensors were used to survey physical and chemical parameters in the Schuylkill River under high and low tide conditions, to improve understanding of underwater phenomena and impacts of extreme weather events.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) equipped with sensors to gather high-resolution data on physical and chemical parameters of the Lower Schuylkill River. The data is being collected to better understand the impacts of extreme weather events like floods on the river's bathymetry, water quality, and sediment dynamics. Specifically, the ASVs are mapping changes in depth, mixing zones, sediment suspension/resuspension, and collecting parameters like pH, temperature, nitrates, etc. under different tidal conditions. The ultimate goals are to improve modeling and prediction capabilities for the river's response to floods, identify infrastructure erosion hotspots, and develop adaptive sampling strategies for efficient long-term monitoring using ASVs. Preliminary results on correlations between some water parameters are also presented.

The paper discusses using ASVs equipped with sensor suites to gather high resolution data on various physical and chemical parameters of a river system. This is done to better understand the impacts of extreme weather events on water quality, sediment transport, and infrastructure. The data is analyzed across high and low tidal conditions and spatial interpolations and correlations are generated. Future work includes responding to floods, longer term studies, and 3D mapping of the system.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using two different ASV platforms - the Clearpath Heron and a custom-made lightweight ASV. What are the key differences in the capabilities of these two platforms and why was it useful to utilize both? 

2. The sensor suite on the custom ASV includes a LISST-ABS sediment concentration sensor. What principle does this sensor operate on to measure sediment concentration and what are its key capabilities?

3. Fig. 1 shows different paths taken by the ASVs. What was the rationale behind the lawn-mower pattern by the custom ASV versus the broader coverage by the Clearpath Heron? How do these complement each other?

4. The interpolation method utilizes a triangulation-based bi-linear approach. What is bi-linear interpolation and why is it useful for generating the spatial maps shown in Figs. 4-9? What are its limitations?  

5. There is discussion of gathering data at high and low tides. What is the hypothesis behind differences expected between high and low tides and what physical phenomena contribute to these differences?

6. Pearson correlation coefficients are utilized to quantify relationships between measurement parameters. What assumptions need to hold for Pearson correlation to be valid? Could other correlation methods be more suitable?

7. It is mentioned that variability across the surveyed region is low for many parameters. What adaptations could be made to the sampling method or choice of measurement locations to better capture spatial variability? 

8. The bathymetry measurements are able to provide 2D cross sections but not full 3D reconstructions. What additional sensing and sampling strategies could enable 3D mapping of the riverbed?

9. The paper mentions plans for longer-term and flood response surveys. What additional sensors or measurement capabilities might be needed to characterize flood conditions and impacts?

10. Adaptive sampling is proposed to maximize information gain for future field experiments. What approaches could you utilize to enable the ASVs to adapt their sampling strategy based on in-situ measurements?
