# [GroupMixNorm Layer for Learning Fair Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent AI systems demonstrate biased predictions resulting in unfair outcomes towards certain groups based on protected attributes like gender, ethnicity, etc. Existing techniques to mitigate such biases have limitations - pre/post-processing methods treat the classifier as a blackbox, while in-processing methods rely on optimizing surrogates of fairness metrics which is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel in-processing GroupMixNorm layer to learn fairer deep learning models. The key idea is to align the distributions of different protected groups by mixing their group-level statistics. Specifically:

- The GroupMixNorm layer normalizes each protected group separately in a batch to collect group-specific mean and variance. 

- It then takes a probabilistic convex combination of these group-level statistics and applies it to all samples. 

- This transforms features to be invariant to the protected attribute, enabling the classifier to focus on task-relevant characteristics.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a flexible and easy to implement GroupMixNorm layer that fits well with mini-batch training of neural networks.

- Achieves improved fairness metrics like demographic parity, equal opportunity etc. with minimal impact on accuracy across tabular and image datasets.

- Analysis shows the layer learns representations invariant to protected attributes and is robust to unseen groups at test time.

- Experiments demonstrate its ability to eliminate bias from pre-trained networks using limited data.

Overall, the GroupMixNorm layer presents an effective architectural approach for fair representation learning that generalizes better to unseen test scenarios. Key advantage is avoiding complex fairness metric optimizations.
