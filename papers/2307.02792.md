# [What Should Data Science Education Do with Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02792)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How should data science education adapt and evolve in light of the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT?The key aspects explored in relation to this question include:- The impact of LLMs on the data science pipeline and the responsibilities of data scientists. The paper argues LLMs are shifting the focus from hands-on coding/analysis to more strategic planning and project management.  - The opportunities for using LLMs as tools to enhance data science education, through personalized learning, dynamic curriculum design, and as teaching assistants.- The need to rethink pedagogical approaches to cultivate creative, critical thinking and interdisciplinary skills in students, instead of just technical proficiency. - Strategies for preventing misuse of LLMs for cheating, while still leveraging their capabilities.- The importance of nurturing human intelligence and creativity in collaboration with LLMs.Overall, the paper seeks to analyze how data science education should evolve its content and teaching methods to prepare students for the paradigm shift brought by powerful AI tools like LLMs. The key hypothesis seems to be that the rise of LLMs necessitates a meaningful evolution in data science pedagogy.
