## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new deep learning framework called Aerial Inspection Classifier (AIC) for automated defect detection in aerial infrastructure images. The AIC framework uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture based on the DenseNet model. The authors modified the DenseNet architecture by adding additional convolutional and max pooling layers to extract hierarchical features from the input images. The AIC model was trained on a dataset of overhead power line images with pixel-level defect annotations. During training, the AIC model learns to classify each pixel in an input image as belonging to either the defect or non-defect class. At inference time, the trained AIC model takes an aerial image as input and outputs a pixel-wise prediction mask highlighting areas belonging to the defect class. By using a deep CNN within a dense connectivity framework, the AIC model is able to effectively learn complex features and spatial relationships in the aerial images to accurately detect diverse defects present on power lines and other infrastructure elements.
