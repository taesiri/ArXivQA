# [Predictions from language models for multiple-choice tasks are not   robust under variation of scoring methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work has compared large language models (LLMs) to human performance, but there is little research directly comparing different methods for deriving LLM predictions on multiple-choice tasks. 
- Different methods (linking functions) used in studies to assess LLM performance can lead to variability in results. This variability entails pronounced researcher degrees of freedom in reporting findings.

Methods:
- The authors systematically compare 5 methods for retrieving LLM answers on a pragmatic language interpretation task with multiple-choice answers:
  1. Free text generation 
  2. String scoring (token probabilities) 
  3. Label scoring (probability of answer labels)
  4. Rating aggregation (Likert-scale rating)
  5. Embedding similarity
- Models tested: GPT-3.5, Davinci, LLaMA, FLAN
- Accuracy and goodness-of-fit to human data are evaluated across methods and models.

Key Findings:
- Performance varies considerably across methods and models. No single method delivers best results for all models.
- Label scoring works well overall. Free generation is best for GPT-instruct.
- Rating aggregation and embedding similarity perform worse.
- Variability in performance assessment leads to researcher degrees of freedom in reporting.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic comparison of different LLM answer scoring methods on a single dataset.
- Demonstrates variability across methods and models in accuracy and fit to human data.
- Highlights importance of awareness of variability to ensure robust and reproducible research practices.

Limitations and Future Work:
- Single narrow dataset limits generalizability
- Future work should extend comparisons to other datasets, languages, architectures, decoding schemes.
- Assess full distributional predictions beyond single target choice.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper systematically compares different methods for deriving predictions from language models on multiple-choice pragmatic language understanding tasks and finds that model predictions are not robust across methods, highlighting issues around researcher degrees of freedom and reproducibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic comparison of different methods for deriving item-level predictions from language models on multiple-choice tasks. Specifically:

- The paper compares several scoring methods, including free generation of responses, probability-based scores, a rating-based method, and embedding similarity. 

- It applies these methods to a case study of pragmatic language interpretation using existing experimental data and finds substantial variability in language model performance both within and across models.

- The authors argue this variability entails pronounced researcher degrees of freedom in reporting language model results. Making this variability explicit is crucial for securing research integrity and robustness of findings when assessing language models.

So in summary, the key contribution is demonstrating and quantifying the variability in language model predictions under different scoring methods, even for the same models and datasets. This has implications for good scientific practice when evaluating language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares several methods for deriving predictions from language models on multiple-choice tasks. Could you elaborate on the motivation behind exploring different linking functions? What implications does the choice of linking function have for assessing language models and comparing them to human performance?

2. One of the methods involves free text generation from the language models. What are some of the challenges with using free generation for multiple-choice tasks? How does the authors' method of manually classifying the generations as correct or incorrect compare to other approaches like automatic metrics?

3. The string scoring method computes various probability-based scores. What is the intuition behind measures like average option probability versus prior-corrected option probability? What are the tradeoffs with using length-normalized or prior-adjusted scores?

4. For the label scoring method, what considerations went into the design of the labeled answer options? How sensitive are the results to the choice and ordering of labels? Were any alternative label schemes explored?

5. The paper explores a rating aggregation method inspired by Likert scale ratings. What motivated this approach and how was the rating scale calibrated? What are some limitations of mapping language model probabilities to a discrete rating scale? 

6. What was the rationale behind testing an embedding similarity method? What encoder architectures and similarity metrics were considered in selecting the reported approach? How sensitive is this method to choices of embeddings and distance metrics?

7. The results show variability across models, methods, and even within methods using different scores. What might account for the instability of predictions, especially for weaker models? Could the variability in part reflect genuine uncertainty or flexibility in interpreting the pragmatic phenomena?

8. For the better performing models like GPT-3, do you have insights into why certain methods worked markedly better than others? To what extent could specialized prompting strategies or fine-tuning account for these differences?

9. The paper emphasizes robustness in reporting and higher reproducibility standards when assessing language models. What concrete steps could researchers take to reduce degrees of freedom in analysis while still exploring diverse linking functions?

10. How might the overall conclusions change if this methods comparison was extended to other multiple choice datasets or domains like common sense reasoning? What cautions should one take in generalizing these results on variability and choice of linking function?
