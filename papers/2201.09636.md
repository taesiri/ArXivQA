# [Neural Implicit Surface Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09636)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we model the continuous evolution of implicit neural surfaces over time using partial differential equations (PDEs)?Specifically, the authors propose using the level set equation (LSE) to govern the evolution of implicit neural surfaces represented as the level sets of a neural network function. This allows modeling smooth deformations and animations of the surfaces in a continuous manner.The key ideas and contributions are:- Extending neural implicit surfaces to space-time by having the network take 4D (x,y,z,t) inputs. This allows representing the entire surface evolution with a single network. - Developing a framework to train the network to follow a specified LSE evolution using analytical constraints, without needing supervision data during the evolution.- Demonstrating the flexibility of this approach on various applications like vector field-based deformations, smoothing/sharpening via mean curvature flow, and interpolation between surfaces.- Introducing a novel network initialization method using a pretrained network that leads to faster convergence.Overall, the central hypothesis is that using neural networks and LSEs together can enable continuous modeling and processing of implicit surfaces in an unsupervised analytical manner. The experiments and results validate this hypothesis.
