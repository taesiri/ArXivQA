# [Differentiable Point-based Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02480)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents a differentiable point-based inverse rendering method called DPIR. It processes multi-view multi-light images or photometric images to estimate geometry and spatially-varying BRDF. DPIR adopts point-based rendering to avoid multiple sampling per ray required in volumetric rendering, thus significantly improving speed. To enable this, the authors devise a hybrid point-volumetric representation for geometry, combining the benefits of both for efficient rendering and ability to model intricate shapes. They also use a regularized basis-BRDF representation to mitigate ill-posedness in jointly estimating geometry and reflectance. Additionally, they propose an efficient point-based shadow detection method. DPIR then jointly optimizes the point locations, radii, diffuse albedo, specular BRDF bases/coefficients, and SDF using point splatting as the differentiable renderer. Experiments demonstrate DPIR outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, speed, and memory footprint. The explicit point representation also enables convenient scene editing applications. Key contributions are the point-based inverse rendering approach, the representations enabling it, shadow handling, and demonstrations of improved performance and editing flexibility.
