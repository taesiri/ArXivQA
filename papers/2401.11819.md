# [SuperCLUE-Math6: Graded Multi-Step Math Reasoning Benchmark for LLMs in   Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Chinese language models. Existing datasets like GSM8K focus only on English and do not sufficiently test multi-step inference abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces SuperCLUE-Math6 (SC-Math6), the first native Chinese dataset for assessing multi-step math reasoning of models. 
- SC-Math6 has over 2000 textual word problems covering diverse grade school topics. Each problem has a natural language solution walkthrough and a follow-up question to test sustained reasoning.

- A novel scoring scheme is proposed that combines (1) Reasoning Steps Score that assigns higher weights to problems with more steps (2) Overall Accuracy Score (3) Comprehensive Score: weighted sum of the above two scores.

- The scheme also provides interpretable Reasoning Levels from 1 to 5 to grade model capabilities.

Key Contributions:

- Creation of the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark (SC-Math6) to evaluate mathematical reasoning of language models through multi-step word problems.

- A transparent scoring framework that quantifies model reasoning capabilities into 5 levels, enabling model evaluation and selection. 

- Extensive experiments on 12 major Chinese models to benchmark performance, with models like GPT-4 showing superior accuracy on multi-step problems.

- The benchmark and analysis provide valuable insights on current model strengths, weaknesses and reasoning skills to guide progress in developing intelligence of Chinese models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel scoring scheme that combines performance over problems with different reasoning steps and overall accuracy. What are the advantages and potential limitations of this scheme compared to using overall accuracy alone?

2. The paper categorizes models into 5 reasoning levels. What are some ways this categorization could be further refined or improved to provide more nuanced assessments? 

3. The paper observes declining performance of models during multi-turn interactions. What modifications could be made to model architectures or training procedures to improve stability over sustained interactions?

4. What types of reasoning capabilities are not tested by the SC-Math6 benchmark? What additional test cases could be incorporated to evaluate a wider range of mathematical reasoning skills?

5. The paper finds a potential correlation between response length and accuracy. What factors may influence this relationship and how could it be studied further? Does longer response always indicate better reasoning?

6. What alternative methods beyond accuracy could be used to evaluate the quality and coherence of the natural language solutions generated by models?

7. What are some ways the diversity and difficulty levels of problems in SC-Math6 could be further enhanced to create an even more comprehensive reasoning benchmark? 

8. How suitable is the SC-Math6 benchmark for evaluating non-Chinese language models? What adaptations would be needed to apply it more universally?

9. The paper demonstrates reasoning level stratification between models. What architectural factors account for the differences in capabilities between lower and higher performing models?

10. What types of real-world applications could benefit from advances in mathematical reasoning inspired by the SC-Math6 benchmark? How could the benchmark evolve to better match real-world requirements?
