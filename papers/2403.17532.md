# [KC-GenRe: A Knowledge-constrained Generative Re-ranking Method Based on   Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) store factual knowledge as triples of (head entity, relation, tail entity). However, KGs are often incomplete, hindering their usage in applications like question answering and recommendations. The task of knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing facts to improve KG completeness.  

- Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for KGC. However, directly utilizing LLMs for KGC re-ranking faces challenges of mismatch between generated text and entities, misordering of candidate rankings, and omission where candidates are not generated.

Proposed Solution - KC-GenRe:
- The paper proposes a knowledge-constrained generative re-ranking model called KC-GenRe that leverages LLMs to re-rank candidate entities predicted by an initial KGE model. 

- To address mismatch, the model frames KGC re-ranking as a task of generating the order of option identifiers rather than entity names. 

- To tackle misordering, a knowledge-guided training method enhances identification and relative ranking of candidates using losses computed over KGE scores.

- To handle omission, a knowledge-augmented inference method provides contextual prompts and constrains output to valid candidate identifier sequences.

Main Contributions:
- KC-GenRe is the first method to utilize generative LLMs for KGC re-ranking, to the best of the authors' knowledge.

- The proposed knowledge-guided training and knowledge-augmented inference methods effectively stimulate the reasoning capacity of LLMs for generating valid KGC rankings.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on multiple KG datasets. Ablations validate the utility of different components in KC-GenRe.
