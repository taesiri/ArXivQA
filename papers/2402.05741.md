# [Real-World Robot Applications of Foundation Models: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advances in foundation models like large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) enable flexible application across different tasks and modalities. However, there has been limited work systematically reviewing and categorizing their application in real-world robotics. 

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the practical application of foundation models in real-world robotics. The key aspects covered are:

1) Categorization of foundation models based on input-output modalities (language, vision, audio, 3D) and downstream tasks.

2) Classification of application methods in robotics into: low-level perception, high-level perception, high-level planning, low-level planning and data augmentation. Different combinations of these lead to four typical use cases.  

3) Construction of robotic foundation models incorporating robot embodiment, in terms of model architecture, datasets and learning objectives.

4) Summary of state-of-the-art in terms of robots, tasks (navigation, manipulation, locomotion, communication) and environments used.

Main Contributions:

- Systematic taxonomy of foundation models from a robotics application perspective 

- Framework categorizing techniques to apply foundation models for perception, planning and control

- Analysis of early progress towards building robotic foundation models  

- Comprehensive survey of literature applying foundation models on physical robots across task domains

The paper concludes with a discussion of limitations of current methods and an outlook on future challenges like exploiting different modalities, hierarchical skill organization, faster control cycles and evaluation benchmarks. Overall, it provides an extensive reference for applying foundation models to advance real-world robotics.
