# [Moving Beyond Downstream Task Accuracy for Information Retrieval   Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and conclusion, the main research question this paper addresses is:

Should IR benchmarks evolve to evaluate systems not just on downstream task accuracy, but also on efficiency considerations like latency and hardware cost?

The key points are:

- Current IR benchmarks like MS MARCO and XOR-TyDi focus only on accuracy metrics. 

- But in real-world deployments, efficiency factors like latency and hardware costs are critical. 

- The "best" system should balance accuracy and efficiency based on the use case.

- By only reporting accuracy, benchmarks encourage optimization on that one dimension, sometimes sacrificing efficiency.

- The authors argue benchmarks should adopt multidimensional evaluation, assessing systems on latency, cost, and accuracy. 

- As proof of concept, they compare several systems on these metrics and show the tradeoffs are significant.

- They propose using "Dynascores" to aggregate multiple metrics into a single score with customizable weightings.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that IR benchmarks need to expand beyond just accuracy to guide research toward models that are accurate, fast, and affordable. The experiments and proposals demonstrate the potential benefits of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Advocating for multidimensional leaderboards for information retrieval benchmarks that assess systems not just on accuracy metrics but also on latency, cost, and other efficiency metrics. 

2. Analyzing existing literature and creating a post-hoc leaderboard for MS MARCO Passage Ranking task that reveals how systems with similar accuracy can differ substantially in other dimensions like latency and cost.

3. Conducting systematic experiments with four representative information retrieval systems (BM25, DPR, ColBERTv2, BT-SPLADE) across different hardware configurations to showcase the tradeoffs between accuracy, latency, and cost. 

4. Proposing the use of Dynascores, a utility-based metric, to create single ranked leaderboards that combine multiple assessment dimensions with customizable weights. Demonstrating how different weightings lead to different rankings and incentives.

5. Offering recommendations on leaderboard design considerations regarding evaluation platform, scoring metrics, and more.

In summary, the key contribution is advocating for more holistic benchmarking in information retrieval that captures multiple real-world values beyond just accuracy, in order to encourage more thorough experimentation and well-rounded progress. The analyses and proposals concretely demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of such multidimensional leaderboards.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper argues that information retrieval benchmarks should include efficiency metrics like latency and cost in addition to accuracy, in order to incentivize optimization along multiple dimensions and reflect real-world deployment constraints.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper on multidimensional information retrieval benchmarking makes several valuable contributions to the field:

- It highlights the limitations of existing IR benchmarks like MS MARCO and XOR-TyDi which focus solely on accuracy metrics. The authors argue convincingly that benchmarks should also incorporate efficiency considerations like latency, hardware cost, etc. 

- The analysis of existing literature reveals significant variability in evaluation methodology as well as under-reporting of key metrics like latency and cost. Creating benchmarks that standardize these metrics would enable more systematic comparisons.

- The experiments with 4 representative IR models (BM25, DPR, SPLADE, PLAID ColBERT) showcase the kinds of hardware-aware, apples-to-apples comparisons that are currently missing. This analysis provides new insights into the tradeoffs between these models.

- The proposal to use DynaScore, a utility-based metric, provides a principled way to create full system rankings that can weight various assessment dimensions as desired. The authors demonstrate the flexibility of this approach.

Overall, this paper makes a compelling argument for evolving IR benchmarks and evaluation to better reflect real-world efficiency constraints. The analysis of current systems and proposal for DynaScore leaderboards offer useful insights for the research community.

In relation to other work:

- This builds on prior arguments for multi-dimensional benchmarks in areas like computer vision (DAWNBench, etc). The focus on IR benchmarks specifically is novel.

- Experiments comparing efficiency of core IR models in a controlled setting are relatively rare compared to reporting lone accuracy metrics.

- DynaScore provides a generalizable metric applicable to many efficiency-aware benchmarks.

In summary, this paper makes both high-level arguments and specific technical contributions that advance the IR benchmarking discussion in valuable new directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing new IR models and techniques that optimize for efficiency as well as accuracy. The authors argue that current benchmarks focus too heavily on accuracy, which has led to models that achieve high accuracy but are inefficient. They suggest more research effort could be put into developing models that achieve a good balance of accuracy and efficiency.

- Exploring different model architectures and training techniques to reduce model size, latency, and hardware requirements. For example, research into more efficient sparse models, quantization, pruning, etc. that can fit in constrained environments.

- Designing hardware-aware IR models and systems that can dynamically adapt their accuracy/efficiency tradeoff based on the available compute resources. Models that can gracefully degrade accuracy for lower latency or fit into smaller memory footprints.

- Research into new algorithms and data structures for efficient retrieval, such as approximate nearest neighbor search methods tailored for text embeddings.

- Development of more advanced resource estimation techniques that can accurately predict hardware usage, latency, and cost of models before deployment. Enabling better model selection.

- Expanding the range of efficiency metrics considered beyond just cost and latency, to also include throughput, FLOPs, memory usage, etc. And research into aggregating them into a single score.

- Establishing common methodologies and reproducible environments for measuring efficiency of IR systems to enable fair comparison.

Overall, the authors argue there needs to be more focus in IR research on optimizing models for real-world efficiency rather than just accuracy on benchmarks. And benchmarks need to evolve to incentivize work in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper argues that current benchmarks for evaluating information retrieval systems focus too narrowly on accuracy metrics and fail to capture important efficiency considerations like query latency and hardware costs. As evidence, the authors construct a post-hoc leaderboard for the MS MARCO benchmark by collecting latency, memory usage, and hardware details from published papers. This reveals substantial variation in efficiency, even among systems with similar accuracy. To further demonstrate the importance of multi-dimensional evaluation, experiments are presented comparing four representative retrieval models (BM25, DPR, SPLADE, ColBERTv2) across diverse hardware configurations and datasets. The results show how the relative ranking of systems changes based on the resources available and the weights assigned to accuracy versus efficiency. The authors propose using Dynascores, which allow configurable weighting of assessment dimensions, as a flexible scoring method to obtain complete system rankings. They conclude that efficiency-aware, multidimensional benchmarks will likely spur innovation in information retrieval.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper argues that current benchmarks for evaluating information retrieval (IR) systems focus too narrowly on accuracy metrics and fail to account for other important dimensions like latency, hardware costs, and memory usage. The authors first construct a post-hoc leaderboard for the MS MARCO Passage Ranking benchmark by compiling results from various published papers. This analysis shows that models with similar accuracy often have very different performance along other dimensions, but these tradeoffs are obscured in existing leaderboards. The authors then systematically evaluate four representative IR models (BM25, DPR, BT-SPLADE, and PLAID ColBERTv2) across diverse hardware configurations on the MS MARCO and XOR-TyDi datasets. These experiments reveal important differences between the models in terms of latency, cost, and accuracy that depend on the hardware used. 

Based on these analyses, the authors recommend that IR benchmarks adopt multidimensional leaderboards that measure systems along dimensions like accuracy, latency, and cost. They propose using Dynascores, which allow benchmark creators to assign weights to each dimension based on their relative importance. Different weightings give rise to different rankings and incentivize tradeoffs between competing objectives like accuracy and efficiency. Overall, the authors demonstrate the limitations of current IR benchmarks and provide evidence that multidimensional leaderboards would lead to more thorough evaluation and well-rounded systems optimized for real-world deployment.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes that information retrieval (IR) benchmarks should adopt multidimensional leaderboards that assess systems not just on accuracy metrics but also on dimensions like latency and cost. As a proof of concept, the authors first construct a post-hoc leaderboard for the MS MARCO dataset by collecting latency, memory usage, and hardware details from prior work and estimating minimum hardware costs. This analysis shows substantial variation between systems and limited focus on optimizing for efficiency. Next, the authors systematically evaluate four IR systems (BM25, DPR, BT-SPLADE-L, PLAID ColBERTv2) across diverse hardware configurations on MS MARCO and XOR-TyDi. By measuring accuracy, latency, and estimated cost, they reveal important trade-offs between these systems hidden by standard accuracy-only benchmarks. Finally, the authors propose using DynaScores, which weight and combine multiple assessment dimensions into a single score, as a flexible way to create multidimensional leaderboards that reflect diverse priorities and incentives. Experiments with DynaScores highlight how different weightings lead to different winning systems.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the paper is addressing the issue that current benchmarks for evaluating information retrieval (IR) systems focus only on accuracy metrics, while ignoring other important dimensions like latency, hardware cost, etc. Specifically:

- Many IR benchmarks like MS MARCO and XOR-TyDi only measure system accuracy through metrics like MRR@10. This can lead to illusory progress, as systems may sacrifice efficiency for marginal accuracy gains. 

- However, in real-world deployments, factors like latency, hardware costs, etc are crucial. The abstract gives the example that the top systems on XOR-TyDi differ by only 0.1 in recall, but their efficiency differences are unclear.

- So the paper argues that IR benchmarks should evolve to include metrics for these other dimensions, not just accuracy. This would lead to more well-rounded systems that optimize for accuracy as well as efficiency.

- As proof of concept, the paper presents experiments with 4 representative IR systems, evaluating them on accuracy, latency, and cost across different hardware configurations. This reveals important tradeoffs hidden by accuracy-only benchmarks.

In summary, the key problem is that current IR benchmarks focus narrowly on accuracy at the expense of other crucial dimensions like efficiency. The paper advocates for more holistic, multidimensional benchmarks that incentivize balanced systems optimized for real-world use.
