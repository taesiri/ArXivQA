# [Activity Grammars for Temporal Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04266)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic approach to improve temporal action segmentation in videos by utilizing an automatically induced activity grammar to guide neural network predictions. The authors propose a new grammar induction algorithm called Key-Action-based Recursive Induction (KARI) that extracts a powerful context-free grammar from action sequences, capturing distinctive temporal structures based on key pivotal actions. They also develop an efficient generalized parser called Breadth-first Earley Parser (BEP) that transforms frame-level probability distributions into reliable action sequences adhering to the induced grammar rules. BEP handles complex recursive rules efficiently through breadth-first search and pruning. The overall pipeline first induces an activity grammar from training sequences using KARI, then BEP parses the frame predictions from an off-the-shelf neural temporal action segmentation model to output an optimal grammar-consistent action sequence. Finally, a segmentation optimization refines alignments to determine action lengths. Experiments on Breakfast and 50 Salads benchmarks show the approach significantly improves segmentation performance and interpretability. The introduced grammar evaluation framework also demonstrates KARI's superior generalization and discrimination capabilities. This novel integration of neural networks with structured symbolic grammars enhances sequence prediction and uncovers compositional structures of activities.
