# [Fine-tuned CLIP Models are Efficient Video Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03640)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that a simple video fine-tuning of the CLIP model (ViFi-CLIP) can be effective for adapting image-pretrained CLIP to video tasks, without needing complex additional modules or components. The key questions explored are:

1) Does fine-tuning CLIP on videos allow it to learn suitable video-specific inductive biases, without tampering its generalization capability? 

2) Can this simple fine-tuning approach perform competitively compared to more complex state-of-the-art methods for adapting CLIP to videos?

3) How does the simple fine-tuning allow CLIP to capture temporal information in videos?

4) In low-data regimes where fine-tuning is not feasible, can a 'bridge and prompt' approach first tune CLIP on videos and then adapt it to downstream tasks via prompting?

The central hypothesis is that the inductive biases of CLIP can be effectively transferred to videos via simple fine-tuning, without needing complex additional components like temporal modeling modules. The key questions aim to validate this hypothesis across different settings like zero-shot, few-shot, etc. and analyze how the fine-tuning provides video-specific adaptations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes ViFi-CLIP (Video Fine-tuned CLIP), a simple yet effective baseline for adapting image-based CLIP models to video tasks. The key idea is to simply fine-tune the full CLIP model (both image and text encoders) on video datasets to bridge the modality gap between images and videos.

2. Through extensive experiments on various settings like zero-shot, few-shot, base-to-novel generalization, and fully supervised, it shows that ViFi-CLIP is highly competitive or better than more complex approaches that use extra components tailored for videos. 

3. It provides analysis and visualizations to demonstrate that simple fine-tuning allows CLIP to implicitly learn video-specific inductive biases related to motion and relationships between objects.

4. For low-data regimes where fine-tuning is not feasible, it proposes a 'bridge and prompt' approach to first bridge the domain gap via fine-tuning and then efficiently adapt the model to downstream tasks via prompt learning.

5. The simplicity of the proposed ViFi-CLIP makes it efficient in terms of compute and throughput compared to methods with specialized video components.

In summary, the key insight is that a simple fine-tuning baseline can effectively adapt image-based CLIP models for video understanding, without the need for complex video-specific components. The simplicity makes it efficient while being highly competitive to state-of-the-art approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a simple yet effective baseline approach called ViFi-CLIP for adapting image-pretrained CLIP models to video tasks by fine-tuning on video datasets, and shows it performs competitively or better than more complex methods on a range of video understanding tasks including zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised evaluation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on adapting image-based vision-language models like CLIP to video:

- The main contribution is proposing a very simple baseline called ViFi-CLIP that just fine-tunes CLIP on video data. This is compared to more complex approaches like XCLIP and ActionCLIP that add extra components for modeling temporal information. 

- The results show ViFi-CLIP matches or exceeds the performance of these more complex methods on various tasks like zero-shot action recognition, few-shot transfer, and base-to-novel generalization. This indicates fine-tuning may be sufficient to adapt CLIP to videos without requiring complex architectural changes.

- The authors conduct experiments across multiple settings (zero-shot, few-shot, full supervision) to thoroughly evaluate generalization. Other works like XCLIP focused more narrowly on just supervised training. 

- They introduce a new base-to-novel split for video datasets to systematically measure generalization. Other works have not explicitly looked at this, instead just doing standard train/test splits.

- For low-data regimes where fine-tuning is not feasible, they propose a "bridge and prompt" method to first fine-tune then adapt prompts. This is more thorough than just using prompts like in prior work.

- Overall, a key conclusion is that a simple fine-tuning approach can be surprisingly effective compared to more sophisticated techniques developed specifically for video. The extensive experiments back this up across various benchmarks and settings.

In summary, this paper provides a very simple but strong baseline and systematic experiments across multiple settings. The results question if complex architectural additions are needed for adapting CLIP to video.
