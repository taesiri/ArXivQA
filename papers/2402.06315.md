# [Multisource Semisupervised Adversarial Domain Generalization Network for   Cross-Scene Sea\textendash Land Clutter Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning methods for sea-land clutter classification in over-the-horizon radar either make an unrealistic assumption that training and test data are identically distributed (empirical risk minimization methods) or are designed for a specific test domain (domain adaptation methods).  
- A more practical scenario is where there may be distribution shifts between multiple training domains (scenes) and unseen deployment domains. This cross-scene classification is challenging.  
- In addition, labeling data across multiple scenes is expensive, so utilizing unlabeled data is desirable.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multisource semisupervised adversarial domain generalization network (MSADGN) which extracts both domain-invariant and domain-specific features to generalize to unseen target domains.
- It assumes one labeled source domain and multiple unlabeled source domains.
- A domain-related pseudolabeling module assigns reliable pseudolabels to unlabeled data using an improved similarity-based method.  
- A domain-invariant module uses a multidiscriminator adversarial network to extract domain-invariant features across all domains.
- A domain-specific module uses parallel classifiers to extract discriminative features from each domain separately. 

Main Contributions:
- First application of a domain generalization method for cross-scene sea-land clutter classification.
- Novel semisupervised domain generalization architecture using both invariant and specific features.
- Domain-related pseudolabeling method to assign labels for multiple unlabeled domains.
- Evaluation on both 1D time-series sea clutter data and 2D aerial image data demonstrates superiority over prior state-of-the-art domain generalization methods.

In summary, the paper presents a new approach to handle cross-scene distribution shifts in sea-land clutter classification using semisupervised learning of invariant and specific features across multiple domains. The method outperforms previous domain generalization techniques.
