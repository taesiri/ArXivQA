# [Texture-GS: Disentangling the Geometry and Texture for 3D Gaussian   Splatting Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10050)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is an emerging 3D scene representation that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering by modeling scenes as a set of 3D Gaussians. However, 3D-GS couples the geometry and appearance within the Gaussian attributes, hindering flexibility for appearance editing operations like texture swapping. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Texture-GS, a novel approach to disentangle geometry and texture for 3D-GS to enable flexible appearance editing. The key idea is to represent appearance as a 2D texture map instead of per-Gaussian colors. 

The main challenge lies in establishing connections between the geometry (3D Gaussians) and texture map. Evaluating a texture mapping MLP at each ray-Gaussian intersection is expensive. Instead, Texture-GS uses:
(1) A UV mapping MLP to project Gaussian centers to UV space.  
(2) Local Taylor expansion of the MLP to efficiently approximate UV coordinates of ray-Gaussian intersections.
(3) A learnable 2D texture to represent appearance.

This texture mapping module maps intersections to a continuous texture space, enabling a smooth texture map while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- First work to disentangle geometry and texture for 3D-GS, enabling flexible appearance editing like texture swapping.

- A novel texture mapping module that efficiently maps ray-Gaussian intersections to a continuous 2D texture space.

- Experiments show Texture-GS facilitates high-fidelity appearance editing and achieves real-time rendering, highlighting its practical utility for interactive 3D editing.

In summary, Texture-GS advances 3D-GS for reconstruction and editing by proposing a disentangled geometry and texture representation along with an efficient texture mapping module to bridge connections between them.
