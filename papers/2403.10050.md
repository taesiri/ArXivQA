# [Texture-GS: Disentangling the Geometry and Texture for 3D Gaussian   Splatting Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10050)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is an emerging 3D scene representation that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering by modeling scenes as a set of 3D Gaussians. However, 3D-GS couples the geometry and appearance within the Gaussian attributes, hindering flexibility for appearance editing operations like texture swapping. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Texture-GS, a novel approach to disentangle geometry and texture for 3D-GS to enable flexible appearance editing. The key idea is to represent appearance as a 2D texture map instead of per-Gaussian colors. 

The main challenge lies in establishing connections between the geometry (3D Gaussians) and texture map. Evaluating a texture mapping MLP at each ray-Gaussian intersection is expensive. Instead, Texture-GS uses:
(1) A UV mapping MLP to project Gaussian centers to UV space.  
(2) Local Taylor expansion of the MLP to efficiently approximate UV coordinates of ray-Gaussian intersections.
(3) A learnable 2D texture to represent appearance.

This texture mapping module maps intersections to a continuous texture space, enabling a smooth texture map while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- First work to disentangle geometry and texture for 3D-GS, enabling flexible appearance editing like texture swapping.

- A novel texture mapping module that efficiently maps ray-Gaussian intersections to a continuous 2D texture space.

- Experiments show Texture-GS facilitates high-fidelity appearance editing and achieves real-time rendering, highlighting its practical utility for interactive 3D editing.

In summary, Texture-GS advances 3D-GS for reconstruction and editing by proposing a disentangled geometry and texture representation along with an efficient texture mapping module to bridge connections between them.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Texture-GS that disentangles geometry and texture in 3D Gaussian splatting to enable flexible real-time texture editing while retaining its superior reconstruction quality and rendering efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose a novel method called Texture-GS to disentangle the geometry and texture for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). This enables various appearance editing applications for 3D-GS, such as texture swapping, which were difficult previously due to the entanglement of geometry and appearance.

2. They propose a texture mapping module to establish the connection between the disentangled geometry (3D Gaussians) and appearance (2D texture map). This module includes an MLP to map Gaussian centers to UV space, a Taylor expansion to efficiently approximate UV coordinates during rendering, and a learnable texture to capture scene appearance.

3. The experiments on the DTU dataset demonstrate that Texture-GS not only facilitates high-fidelity appearance editing like texture swapping and painting, but also achieves real-time rendering speeds on consumer GPUs. This shows the potential of Texture-GS for applications requiring interactive 3D scene manipulation and visualization.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of Texture-GS to disentangle geometry and texture for 3D-GS, which enables flexible appearance editing while retaining the real-time rendering capability. The texture mapping module is key to achieving this disentanglement.
