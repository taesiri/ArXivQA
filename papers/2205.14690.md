# CoNT: Contrastive Neural Text Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the LaTeX code, this paper does not seem to explicitly state a central research question or hypothesis. The code appears to contain formatting instructions and placeholder text for various sections of a research paper (title, authors, abstract, introduction, etc.), but does not include the core content describing a specific research problem, methods, or results. A few things I can infer:- This seems to be a draft paper template for a conference submission, formatted according to the style guidelines of the "NeurIPS 2022" conference. - The paper is likely about contrastive learning for neural text generation. The abstract mentions proposing a new contrastive neural text generation framework called "CoNT" to address limitations of prior contrastive learning approaches for text generation tasks.- The introduction references using contrastive learning to alleviate "exposure bias" and introduces sequence-level training signals as being important for generation tasks. This suggests the research may be investigating how to effectively apply contrastive learning techniques to create better sequence-level representations for text generation.- The paper validates the proposed CoNT framework on various text generation tasks like machine translation, summarization, etc. So a main goal seems to be showing CoNT can improve performance over non-contrastive baselines and prior contrastive methods across different generation tasks.However, without seeing the core content sections filled in, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific central hypothesis or research question being addressed in this draft paper. The placeholder content mainly provides hints about the general research direction and approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new contrastive neural text generation framework called CoNT. The key ideas of CoNT include:- Using negative examples from the model's own predictions during training instead of just from-batch samples. This exposes the model to its potential mistakes during inference.- Using an N-pairs contrastive loss that gives a finer-grained treatment to contrastive examples based on their sequence-level scores, unlike prior losses like InfoNCE. - Incorporating the learned sequence similarity score directly into the inference/decoding stage, rather than just using likelihood.- Showing strong improvements from CoNT on a diverse set of text generation tasks, including machine translation, summarization, data-to-text generation, code generation, and commonsense generation. CoNT establishes new SOTA results on several benchmarks.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel way to effectively apply contrastive learning to text generation through improvements in sampling strategy, loss function, and decoding. The gains on multiple generation tasks demonstrate the broad usefulness of the CoNT framework.
