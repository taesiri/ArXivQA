# [Generalising Multi-Agent Cooperation through Task-Agnostic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing communication methods for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are task-specific, requiring agents to learn a new communication strategy for each unique cooperative task. This is inefficient, especially given MARL's poor sample efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes learning a task-agnostic, environment-specific communication strategy that can be shared across all cooperative tasks within the same environment. This is done by pre-training a set autoencoder using observations collected from random exploration of the environment, without any task-specific rewards. 

The set autoencoder takes a variable number of agent observations as input and encodes them into a fixed-size latent state that approximates the underlying Markov state. This latent state is used by the agents' policies during task learning.

Since the autoencoder is trained in a self-supervised manner to reconstruct the global observation, the learned communication strategy is task-agnostic. Theoretical results show this leads to guaranteed convergence and bounded value error.

The proposed method also enables handling variable numbers of agents, detecting out-of-distribution events at test time, and learning grounded communication strategies.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes learning a task-agnostic, environment-specific communication strategy for MARL that can generalize to unseen cooperative tasks.

- Provides theoretical guarantees on return convergence and value error bounds.

- Enables supporting variable numbers of agents and detecting out-of-distribution events.

- Empirically demonstrates superior performance over task-specific communication strategies on unseen cooperative tasks, as well as the ability to scale to more agents than seen during training.
