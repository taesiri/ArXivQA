# [Safety-Critical Coordination of Legged Robots via Layered Controllers   and Forward Reachable Set based Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08689)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method for the safety-critical coordination of legged robots operating in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. A three-layer control architecture is proposed, consisting of (1) a top-level safety-critical trajectory planner using control barrier functions (CBFs) and forward reachable sets to guarantee collision avoidance, (2) a middle-level model predictive controller using single rigid body dynamics to generate optimal desired ground reaction forces for tracking the safe trajectories, and (3) a low-level whole-body controller based on virtual constraints and quadratic programming to achieve the desired motions and forces. Both simulation and hardware experiments are presented with quadruped robots coordinating locomotion tasks among moving obstacles and agents, demonstrating the approach's ability to ensure safe trajectories while still achieving desired locomotion objectives. Key innovations include the use of high-order CBFs for second-order trajectory planning models and leveraging forward reachable sets for tighter safety constraints. The framework provides a method for multi-agent legged robot coordination with formal safety guarantees even in uncertain, dynamic environments.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of safely coordinating teams of legged robots that need to locomote in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. Ensuring safe coordination of legged robots in such settings is difficult due to the high-dimensional, highly dynamic, and hybrid nature of legged locomotion. The key problems are: (1) generating coordination strategies that avoid collisions with moving obstacles and other robots, (2) tracking desired trajectories during locomotion while respecting safety constraints, and (3) implementing coordination controllers on high-DOF legged robots. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a layered control architecture with three components:

(1) A top-level safety-critical coordination planner that uses control barrier functions (CBFs) based on forward reachable sets to generate safe coordination trajectories for second-order models of the robots while avoiding moving obstacles.

(2) A middle-level model predictive control (MPC) planner that calculates optimal desired ground reaction forces (GRFs) using single rigid body (SRB) models to track the safe coordination trajectories from the top layer.

(3) A low-level whole-body controller that tracks the desired GRFs and safe trajectories using quadratic programming with virtual constraints and input-output linearization on the full dynamics models.

Key Contributions:

- A method to compute forward reachable sets and regions of potential collision for legged robots in dynamic environments. This is used to formulate control barrier functions that ensure safety during coordination.

- A layered architecture and algorithms that achieve safe coordinated locomotion by bridging trajectory optimization, GRF planning, and whole-body control with different model abstractions.  

- Experimental validation in both simulation and on hardware with quadruped robots coordinating locomotion tasks with moving obstacles and other robots, while successfully avoiding collisions.

The main impact is a framework for safe coordination of teams of legged robots in dynamic environments, which has not been sufficiently addressed in prior legged robotics literature. The layered methodology also connects high-level planning with low-level control.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a layered control architecture with a safety-critical coordination planner using control barrier functions and forward reachable sets to guarantee safe locomotion of multiple legged robots in dynamic environments with moving obstacles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a safety-critical approach to the coordination of legged robots in dynamic environments. Specifically, the paper:

1) Presents a safety-critical CBF-based coordination planner that can guarantee the safety of multi-legged robot systems in environments with moving obstacles. 

2) Introduces a layered control framework to address locomotion tracking of optimal trajectories for safe coordination. This includes a top layer planner for safety-ensured coordination, a middle layer for optimal GRF generation, and a bottom layer for whole-body control.

3) Provides experimental validation of the safety-critical coordination approach on quadrupedal robots, including both simulations and hardware experiments with dynamic environments involving moving obstacles and other robots.

The key novelty is using control barrier functions along with forward reachable sets to enable provably safe coordination of multiple legged robots in dynamic environments, which has not been well explored before. The layered architecture also effectively connects high-level planning with low-level control to achieve such safe coordinated locomotion on real robotic platforms.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a 3-layered control architecture. What is the motivation behind using a layered architecture instead of a single centralized controller? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

2) The top layer uses a second-order model for trajectory planning. Why is the second-order model sufficient for guaranteeing safety through control barrier functions? What limitations does this simplified model introduce?   

3) The concept of a "region of potential collision" is introduced. How is this constructed from the forward reachable sets? Why is it beneficial to use the forward reachable sets for planning safe trajectories rather than just using the current state?

4) High-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) are employed to account for the lack of control input in the second-order model. Explain the formulation of HOCBFs and how they differ from regular CBFs. What is the interpretation of the additional functions ψ1 and ψ2?

5) The middle layer uses model predictive control (MPC) with single rigid body (SRB) dynamics. Why are SRB dynamics used here rather than the full dynamics model? What are the tradeoffs with linearizing the SRB dynamics for MPC?

6) Explain the virtual constraints formulation used in the whole-body controller. Why is it beneficial to cast the controller as a quadratic program with virtual constraints rather than directly tracking joint trajectories?

7) Compare the different cost functions and constraints used in the QP formulations at each layer. How do these reflect the objectives at each level of control? 

8) The experiments use a centralized method for multi-agent coordination. What changes would need to be made to implement a distributed coordination strategy? What additional challenges might arise?

9) Discuss the results demonstrating safe coordination in dynamic environments. What metrics indicate that the overall approach was successful? How might the performance be further improved?

10) This method currently requires known state information for all agents and obstacles. How could the approach deal with unknown or partially observed environments and agents? What modifications would need to be made?
