# [Safety-Critical Coordination of Legged Robots via Layered Controllers   and Forward Reachable Set based Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08689)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method for the safety-critical coordination of legged robots operating in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. A three-layer control architecture is proposed, consisting of (1) a top-level safety-critical trajectory planner using control barrier functions (CBFs) and forward reachable sets to guarantee collision avoidance, (2) a middle-level model predictive controller using single rigid body dynamics to generate optimal desired ground reaction forces for tracking the safe trajectories, and (3) a low-level whole-body controller based on virtual constraints and quadratic programming to achieve the desired motions and forces. Both simulation and hardware experiments are presented with quadruped robots coordinating locomotion tasks among moving obstacles and agents, demonstrating the approach's ability to ensure safe trajectories while still achieving desired locomotion objectives. Key innovations include the use of high-order CBFs for second-order trajectory planning models and leveraging forward reachable sets for tighter safety constraints. The framework provides a method for multi-agent legged robot coordination with formal safety guarantees even in uncertain, dynamic environments.
