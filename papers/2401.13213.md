# [Common-Sense Bias Discovery and Mitigation for Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13213)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for discovering and mitigating bias in machine learning models rely on analyzing the model's latent representations. However, subtle or unlabeled features that correlate with the model's predictions can be overlooked in the latent space. The authors propose leveraging natural language descriptions of images to perform "common sense reasoning" about potential biases.  

Method: 
The authors propose Common Sense Bias Discovery (CSBD), which analyzes text descriptions corresponding to images to discover correlated visual features. First, descriptive phrases are extracted from captions and embedded using a sentence encoder. The phrase embeddings are clustered hierarchically into "categories" and more fine-grained "features". Then, the co-occurrence statistics of feature pairs are analyzed across images to identify strongly correlated features. A human examines the correlations to determine which may negatively impact a downstream classification task.

For bias mitigation, images are re-weighted during training to balance the distribution of sensitive features with respect to the classification targets. This breaks the statistical dependence between sensitive features and targets.

Contributions:
1) A novel method to extract comprehensive and human-interpretable visual features from text descriptions via clustering.

2) Quantifying feature co-occurrence to discover potentially sensitive correlations, with a human-in-the-loop to identify problematic cases.  

3) Empirical demonstration that the discovered correlations indicate model biases on two benchmark vision datasets. The data re-weighting scheme successfully mitigates biases and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous bias mitigation methods.

In summary, the key insight is that reasoning about images using natural language provides a new perspective for uncovering biases compared to latent space analysis. By discovering and mitigating subtle but sensitive feature correlations, the authors bridge a gap in existing bias discovery techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to discover and mitigate dataset bias by analyzing image descriptions to extract common-sense visual features, quantify their correlations, identify sensitive ones via human-in-the-loop, and reweight data samples to break spurious correlations that lead to model bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel common-sense reasoning approach that discovers human-interpretable "feature clusters" (beyond the image embedding level) existing in image datasets.  

2. Based on the clusters, a formulation to derive pairwise image feature correlations, order them by significance, and allow human domain experts to identify sensitive correlations for further intervention.

3. Empirical evidence that the proposed method discovers subtle sensitive features and model biases for classification tasks, which to the best of the authors' knowledge have not been previously identified and addressed. The method also achieves state-of-the-art bias mitigation results by adjusting data sampling weights calculated automatically from the derived feature distributions.

In summary, the key contribution is using text-based common-sense reasoning to discover novel and subtle biases in vision datasets, combined with an interpretable analysis and simple but effective bias mitigation strategy. The method provides a new perspective and capability for bias discovery and mitigation compared to existing latent space based approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Common-sense bias discovery
- Textual image descriptions
- Feature correlation analysis 
- Human-in-the-loop
- Bias mitigation
- Dataset re-weighting
- Facial attribute classification
- Object recognition

The paper proposes a new method called "Common-Sense Bias Discovery" (CSBD) that uses textual descriptions of images to discover biases and spurious correlations between visual features. It extracts visual "features" from text descriptions via semantic parsing and embedding, computes correlations between features, and has a human identify sensitive correlations. These correlations are then mitigated by re-weighting the dataset to break the statistical dependence. Experiments show CSBD discovers new subtle biases on facial attribute and object classification tasks, and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised bias mitigation techniques.

Key aspects of the method include leveraging common-sense knowledge fromdescriptions, maintaining a human-in-the-loop to identify sensitive correlations, and simple data-based interventions to mitigate discovered biases. The key terms reflect this novel pipeline and its application areas.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel common-sense reasoning approach to discover image feature correlations. What are the key advantages of using common-sense reasoning over relying solely on image embeddings for bias discovery?

2. The method parses text descriptions into semantic components which are then clustered into "categories" and "features". What is the intuition behind this two-stage clustering process? How does it help capture a more comprehensive set of visual features compared to other approaches?

3. The paper introduces a formulation to quantify correlation between any two textual features based on their co-occurrence patterns. Explain this formulation for the phi correlation coefficient in detail. What are its advantages over other correlation measures? 

4. A human-in-the-loop step is included to identify sensitive correlations from the discovered set. Why is this necessary? What criteria might a human expert use to differentiate sensitive vs benign correlations?

5. For bias mitigation, the paper reweights data samples to balance distribution of sensitive features across targets. Walk through the mathematical formulation for calculating these new sampling weights. What assumptions does this method make?

6. How does the common-sense reasoning approach help identify and treat biases that are overlooked by existing latent space based methods? Explain with examples from the experiments. 

7. The ablation studies experiment with different text encoders and dimension reduction techniques. Compare USE vs CLIP and PCA vs UMAP in terms of the resulting cluster quality. What inferences can you draw about the best practices?

8. Explain the intuition behind using the cluster variance to automatically determine the number of features per category. How does this lead to semantically coherent feature clusters? 

9. Analyze the sensitivity analysis on the variance threshold hyperparameter. What is the impact of choosing too small vs too large of a value? What is a reasonable value?

10. The method relies on text descriptions being available. Discuss the limitations of leveraging synthetic captions from pre-trained models. What risks would this introduce in discovering biases?
