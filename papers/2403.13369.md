# [Clinical information extraction for Low-resource languages with Few-shot   learning using Pre-trained language models and Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vast amounts of clinical data are stored in unstructured text like doctor's letters, making it difficult to leverage for research and clinical use. Automatically extracting information poses challenges around needing clinical expertise, limited computational resources, privacy regulations, and interpretability.

Proposed Solutions (S1-S4):
- Reduce need for clinical knowledge by using existing data like routine documents to create pre-trained language models (PLMs), combined with few-shot learning methods like prompting which require little labeled data (S1). 
- Reduce annotation costs through few-shot learning instead of full supervised training, using prompting methods like PET and semi-supervised learning (S2).
- Use smaller PLMs ($110-340$ million parameters) that work well with few-shot prompting and fit computational constraints, rather than large models (S3).
- Enhance interpretability and transparency using Shapley values to select data, optimize models, and explain predictions (S4).

Key Findings:  
- Further pretraining general PLMs like gbert on clinical data works better than models like medbertde pretrained on just medical data, when using few-shot prompting (S1).
- Few-shot prompting with PET gives much higher accuracy than supervised classifiers with little data, closing the gap to full supervision with more shots (S2).
- Smaller PLMs perform on par with larger ones for few-shot prompting, unlike for supervised models (S3).
- Shapley values help select optimal few-shot samples and models, and explain individual predictions (S4).

Main Contributions:
- First systematic evaluation of few-shot prompting methods like PET and semi-supervised learning in clinical NLP.
- Analysis of different pretraining strategies for clinical domain transfer with few-shot scenarios.
- Demonstration of smaller PLMs working well for few-shot prompting in the clinical domain.
- Use of interpretability methods like Shapley values for data/model selection and explanation.

The paper makes a compelling case for few-shot prompting as an effective approach to clinical NLP that reduces annotation needs and allows use of smaller models, while maintaining interpretability. Key results and analyses provide guidance for real-world clinical NLP applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a systematic evaluation of advanced domain adaptation and prompting methods using pretrained language models in a low-resource medical domain task of multi-class section classification on German doctor's letters, achieving significant improvements in accuracy with minimal training data and ensuring interpretability of results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper presents best-practice strategies and a systematic evaluation to address the challenges of conducting medical information extraction (MIE) tasks, such as clinical section classification, in low-resource clinical settings. Specifically, the paper shows:

1) Prompt-based learning methods using further-pretrained language models can effectively reduce the need for manual annotation by clinical experts. With only 20 training shots, a prompt-based model achieves much higher accuracy than a traditional classifier trained on the full dataset.

2) Adding contextual paragraphs and using larger language models further improves performance and robustness, allowing prompt-based models trained on 50 shots to reach comparable performance (-9pp accuracy) to traditional models trained on full datasets.  

3) The paper demonstrates the utility of model interpretability methods like Shapley values for optimizing small training datasets and model selection in low-resource clinical NLP scenarios.

In summary, the paper provides both empirical findings and actionable guidelines for setting up MIE projects under common constraints in clinical settings, especially for lower-resourced languages.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using further pre-training of general domain PLMs like gbert on medical domain data to improve performance on clinical NLP tasks. How does this approach compare to training PLMs like medbertde from scratch solely on medical texts? What are the trade-offs?

2. The paper evaluates prompt-based few-shot learning using Pattern Exploiting Training (PET). How does PET compare to other prompting methods like soft prompting or continuous prompting? What are some of the advantages and limitations of the PET approach?

3. The paper finds that null prompts perform competitively compared to carefully engineered prompt templates. Why might this be the case? What implications does this have for reducing engineering costs in clinical NLP projects?

4. Contextualization of samples by adding surrounding paragraphs is found to significantly improve classification accuracy. What mechanisms might drive this improvement in the models? How could this approach fail?

5. Shapley values are proposed to select optimal models and training samples. What specific benefits do they provide over other interpretability methods? What cautions need to be kept in mind when using them?

6. The paper uses accuracy and F1-score to evaluate model performance. What other evaluation metrics could provide additional insights into model behavior, especially for clinical applications?

7. Error analysis reveals the models struggle with some document structuring conventions like section titles. How could the data representation and models be enhanced to better capture these features?  

8. What modifications would be needed to deploy the proposed methods on large language models compared to smaller BERT models? What challenges might arise?

9. The models are evaluated in a low-resource setting for German. How well might the findings transfer to other languages like English or completely low-resource languages?

10. What additional real-world factors like model deployment constraints, automatic evaluation issues etc. would need to be considered before translating these methods to live clinical applications?
