# [Length Extrapolation of Transformers: A Survey from the Perspective of   Position Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Length Extrapolation of Transformers: A Survey from the Perspective of Position Encoding":

Problem:
- Transformers have become the dominant architecture for many NLP tasks due to their superior ability to model complex dependencies in sequences. However, they suffer from a predefined context length limit (usually 512 or 1024 tokens) due to their quadratic complexity, which makes it difficult to apply them to long sequences. 
- Length extrapolation, i.e. training on short contexts while being able to inference on longer ones, seems to be the most feasible way to apply Transformers to long sequences without expensive training costs. However, Transformers fail to extrapolate well to longer contexts beyond those seen during training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper comprehensively reviews methods for enhancing the length extrapolation of Transformers from the perspective of position encodings (PEs), which play a vital role in equipping Transformers with notion of order and have proven critical for extrapolation.
- The methods are organized based on whether they are absolute PEs (APE) or relative PEs (RPE), as well as if they were proposed before or after the rise of large language models (LLMs).
- For APEs, methods like sinusoidal PE, SHAPE, CAPE, complex PE, FLOATER are introduced, which leverage ideas like randomness and continuity to enhance extrapolation.
- For RPEs, methods like RPE bias, ALiBi, KERPLE, RoPE are elaborated, which are dominant recently due to inherent benefits for extrapolation.
- Specific sections are devoted to introductions of popular methods in the LLM era, including position interpolation methods and randomized PEs.

Main Contributions:
- Provides formal formulations and comparisons of different extrapolatable PEs from the birth of Transformer until now.
- Organizes scattered research efforts towards length extrapolation of Transformers in a unified perspective and notation, enabling easy understanding and selection between methods.  
- Summarizes mainstream PEs adopted by recent influential LLMs and dedicates separate sections to emerging methods and frontiers unique to the LLM era.
- Reveals limitations of existing work and discusses multiple open challenges to stimulate future research towards enhanced extrapolation of Transformers and LLMs.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Length extrapolation - The core concept, referring to the capability of models to make inferences on longer sequences than seen during training.

- Transformers - The neural architecture that the paper focuses on enhancing length extrapolation for.

- Position encodings (PEs) - Different methods to inject positional information into Transformers to aid extrapolation. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of various PEs.

- Absolute position encodings (APEs) - PEs that assign an absolute position representation to each token.

- Relative position encodings (RPEs) - PEs that represent position based on relative distances between tokens. 

- Pretrained language models (PLMs) - Transformer models pretrained on large amounts of text data. Extrapolation is important for applying them to long sequences.

- Language modeling - The standard evaluation task used to measure extrapolation capability, by measuring perplexity on long contexts.

- Position interpolation - Popular techniques to enhance extrapolation of existing PLMs by interpolating positional embeddings for longer sequences.

- Randomized PEs - Methods that expose models to more possible position representations during training to improve extrapolation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses both absolute and relative position encodings (PEs) for improving length extrapolation of Transformers. What are the key differences between absolute and relative PEs in terms of how they represent position information? What implications might this have on extrapolation capability?

2. The paper introduces several PEs like CAPE, FLOATER, and KERPLE. Can you explain the core ideas behind these methods and how they aim to improve extrapolation compared to the original sinusoidal PE? 

3. Position interpolation methods like NTK-aware interpolation and YaRN have become quite popular recently. Can you outline the intuition behind interpolating positions to extend context length? What are some key innovations proposed in these methods?

4. The paper discusses randomized PEs as an alternative way to improve extrapolation. How does the idea behind randomized PEs differ from position interpolation methods? What are some potential benefits and downsides of this approach?

5. RoPE has become the most widely adopted PE in recent LLMs, yet the paper says it has poor extrapolation capabilities. Why does RoPE perform well in general but not extrapolate well, and what modifications have been proposed to address this?

6. The survey focuses predominantly on modifications to PEs to improve extrapolation. But the concluding section mentions that PE is just one component impacting extrapolation. What are some other factors that likely contribute to extrapolation capability?

7. The paper frequently states that relative PEs exhibit better extrapolation than absolute PEs. What theoretical justification is provided for why this is the case? Do you think this reasoning fully explains the difference?

8. Several PEs like ALiBi and KERPLE are derived from ideas in kernel methods and functional analysis. Can you explain the connections to these fields and how they informed the PE designs? 

9. The paper categorizes PEs along several axes like manifestation, learnability, integration method etc. What are some potential pros and cons of making a PE more complex along each of these axes?

10. The conclusion states that current evaluation focuses too narrowly on perplexity. What limitations exist with using perplexity to measure extrapolation, and what alternatives could address these? What are some challenges in developing better benchmarks?
