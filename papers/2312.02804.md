# [Score-Aware Policy-Gradient Methods and Performance Guarantees using   Local Lyapunov Conditions: Applications to Product-Form Stochastic Networks   and Queueing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02804)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new family of gradient estimators called score-aware gradient estimators (SAGEs) for Markov decision processes (MDPs) that have exponential family stationary distributions, common in product-form stochastic networks and queueing systems. SAGEs leverage the structure of the stationary distribution to estimate the policy gradient without relying on value functions, reducing variance and accelerating learning compared to traditional policy gradient methods like actor-critic. The authors prove local convergence guarantees for a SAGE-based stochastic gradient ascent algorithm, requiring only local stability assumptions thanks to the use of a local Lyapunov function. They demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on two numerical examples of product-form networks, where SAGE significantly outperforms actor-critic in finding close-to-optimal policies. A key insight is that by exploiting model-specific structure, SAGEs can circumvent some limitations of general-purpose policy gradient methods when applied to stochastic networks and queueing systems. The local convergence theory also opens the door to optimizing control policies in systems that are only locally stable.
