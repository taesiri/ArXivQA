# [A Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Point Cloud   Upsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02719)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing point cloud upsampling methods predict dense points by extracting features from sparse inputs and passing them through an upsampling module. This is an indirect approach and struggles to generate complex geometric details.  
- These methods are also sensitive to noise due to reliance on Chamfer Distance loss during training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) called PUDM for point cloud upsampling. 
- PUDM directly models the gradient of the dense point cloud distribution, allowing it to capture fine details. The sparse points serve as a condition.
- A dual mapping paradigm further enhances point feature learning.
- Modeling a rate prior enables high quality generation at arbitrary upsampling scales.

Main Contributions:
- First application of conditional DDPM to point cloud upsampling. Directly works with dominant features of ground truth.
- Dual mapping improves conditional network's point feature perception.
- Exploiting rate prior allows flexible inference across scales.
- Quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art on public datasets, with improved geometric detail generation and noise robustness.
- Provides analysis of using DDPM for point cloud upsampling, including advantages and limitations.

In summary, the paper pioneers a conditional DDPM approach for point cloud upsampling to address limitations of existing indirect methods. Key innovations around dual mapping and rate modeling enable robust generation of fine details across scales. Superior performance is demonstrated through extensive experiments.
