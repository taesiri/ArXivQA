# [Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13040)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Current knowledge editing (KE) research focuses only on the monolingual setting, typically English. However, real-world applications often require editing knowledge in one language and querying it in other languages. 
- Existing KE methods like in-context learning (IKE) can work for monolingual KE but perform poorly for cross-lingual KE. IKE also lacks scalability and precision as it requires providing all edited facts every time.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor (ReMaKE) which performs KE by retrieving relevant facts from a multilingual knowledge base and concatenating it with user's query to create prompts for the language model.

- ReMaKE has two main components:
   1) Multilingual knowledge retriever which retrieves the most relevant fact to the user's query from the knowledge base. This helps filter out irrelevant information.
   2) Multilingual in-context editor which creates prompts by concatenating retrieved fact (or no fact if irrelevant) with user query. It performs zero-shot or few-shot in-context learning to guide the language model.

- ReMaKE can perform model-agnostic KE in a multilingual setting by editing knowledge in one language and querying it in other languages.

Main Contributions:
- First multilingual KE framework applicable to any LLM and scalable to editing large number of facts in different languages.
- Shows significant gains over IKE and other baselines across 12 languages, demonstrating its readiness for real-world deployment. 
- Provides multilingual editing dataset MzsRE in 12 languages to foster research in this area.

In summary, the paper addresses the important problem of multilingual KE by proposing a retrieval augmented framework ReMaKE that can edit and query facts across languages in a scalable manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Retrieval-augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor (ReMaKE), a scalable and effective method for editing factual knowledge in large language models across multiple languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing ReMaKE, the first multilingual knowledge editing framework that can perform model-agnostic knowledge editing across languages. 

2. Showing evidence that ReMaKE significantly outperforms baseline knowledge editing methods like IKE, with improvements ranging from +24.76 to +58.72 in average accuracy score across 12 languages. This indicates ReMaKE's potential for real-world deployment at scale.

3. Providing the first multilingual knowledge editing dataset (MzsRE) in 12 languages to foster research in this direction.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling knowledge edited in one language (e.g. English) to be accurately queried in other languages, which has not been shown before. ReMaKE does this in a scalable way by combining multilingual retrieval with in-context learning. The strong experimental results across languages and the new multilingual dataset are also valuable contributions.

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Knowledge editing (KE)
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Multilingual knowledge editing
- Retrieval-augmented knowledge editor
- In-context learning (ICL)
- Prompts
- Zero-shot editing
- Few-shot editing
- Reliability metric
- Generality metric
- Locality metric

- ReMaKE framework

The paper proposes a retrieval-augmented multilingual knowledge editor (ReMaKE) to update and edit factual knowledge in large language models in a multilingual setting. It utilizes prompts and in-context learning, along with a multilingual retriever, to perform zero-shot and few-shot knowledge editing. The paper introduces a multilingual zsRE dataset and evaluates ReMaKE on reliability, generality, locality and portability metrics across 12 languages. So those are some of the key terms and concepts related to this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the proposed method in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a retrieval-augmented multilingual knowledge editor (ReMaKE). How does augmenting knowledge editing with retrieval help address the challenges of multilingual knowledge editing?

2. ReMaKE uses a simple multilingual retriever to search the knowledge base. What are some ways this retriever could be improved or made more sophisticated to enhance ReMaKE's capabilities? 

3. The paper shows ReMaKE works across 12 languages. What factors might determine how well ReMaKE generalizes to other languages not studied in the paper?

4. ReMaKE combines multilingual retrieval with in-context learning for knowledge editing. Why is in-context learning well suited for knowledge editing in this multilingual setting? What are its advantages?

5. How robust is ReMaKE to errors or limitations in the translation quality of the knowledge base facts and queries? How could translation quality impact its performance?

6. Could ReMaKE be adapted to do knowledge editing sequentially across multiple languages instead of just between language pairs? What challenges might this entail?

7. The locality results show ReMaKE has less impact on unrelated knowledge queries. Why does the retriever play an important role in achieving high locality?

8. The paper finds performance differs substantially across languages. What enhancements could make ReMaKE work more uniformly across many diverse languages? 

9. How well could ReMaKE handle editing and querying knowledge involving terminology, named entities, or facts unique to less-resourced languages? What issues might arise?

10. Beyond fact updates, how extensible is ReMaKE's approach to editing other types of knowledge deficits like cultural knowledge or common sense concepts? What limitations might exist?
