# [Benchmark Self-Evolving: A Multi-Agent Framework for Dynamic LLM   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Static benchmark datasets are becoming inadequate to accurately evaluate rapidly advancing large language models (LLMs). This is due to the models' quick evolution and potential data contamination issues during training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a benchmark self-evolving framework powered by a multi-agent system to dynamically extend existing benchmarks for a more scalable, robust and fine-grained LLM evaluation.

- The framework generates new instances by modifying context or questions of original benchmarks using 6 reframing operations: question alternating/complicating, context paraphrasing/noising/reversing, and sub-ability probing. 

- A multi-agent generator is designed, involving a pre-filter, an instance creator, a verifier and a candidate option formulator. This system ensures the accuracy of dynamically generated instances.

Main Contributions:  
- Provides scalable evaluation by creating more complex or alternative questions to test generalization.

- Enables robust evaluation via perturbations to contexts like paraphrasing, noising and reversing to examine model robustness.  

- Allows fine-grained evaluation by generating sub-ability questions to probe key reasoning skills.

- Expands performance gaps between models and also the discrepancies of a single model across tasks.

- Mitigates skewed evaluation caused by data contamination.

- The proposed framework is model-agnostic and can generalize to diverse tasks. Experiments on mathematical, logical, commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension tasks demonstrate its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a benchmark self-evolving framework that uses a multi-agent system to dynamically manipulate the context or question of existing benchmark instances to generate more diverse, complex and robust test cases for evaluating rapidly advancing large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a benchmark self-evolving framework to dynamically evaluate rapidly advancing large language models (LLMs). The key aspects of this contribution include:

1) Utilizing a multi-agent system to manipulate the context or question of original benchmark instances to generate new evolving instances that extend existing benchmarks. This enables more scalable, robust, and fine-grained evaluation of LLMs.

2) Implementing six types of reframing operations to construct the evolving instances, including generating alternative questions, adding noise or paraphrasing the context, and probing sub-abilities like planning skills. These test LLMs against diverse queries, data noise, and their problem-solving capabilities. 

3) Demonstrating through experiments that the framework leads to a general performance decline for most LLMs compared to original benchmarks. This helps reveal limitations in their generalization, robustness, and true capabilities more accurately.

4) Showing that the framework expands performance discrepancies between models and also a single model's differences across tasks. This facilitates better-informed model selection for specific applications.

In summary, the key contribution is the benchmark self-evolving framework leveraging a multi-agent system to dynamically manipulate existing benchmarks for more comprehensive and accurate LLM evaluation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the multi-agent system facilitate collaboration on evolving instance generation and double-verification? What are the specific roles of each agent?

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GPT-4 to power the various agents in the system? How could the reliability of the agents be further improved? 

3. The paper mentions implementing 6 reframing operations. Can you discuss in more detail the rationale and methodology behind choosing these specific operations? Are there other potentially useful operations that could be added?

4. When generating alternative or more complex questions during scalable evaluation, what strategies does the instance creator agent employ to ensure the appropriateness and relevance of the new questions? 

5. How exactly does the system determine when the polarity or key details should be reversed during the polarity reversing operation under robust evaluation? What is the thought process?

6. For the fine-grained evaluation, how did the authors select the specific sub-abilities of task planning, knowledge identification and context retrieval to focus on? Are there any other critical sub-abilities that should be probed?

7. Could you analyze the differences in methodology between scalable/robust evaluation and fine-grained evaluation? Why can't the same approach be used?

8. How does the candidate option formulator ensure that the incorrect answers it generates are relevant and challenging rather than completely nonsensical? 

9. What metrics could be used during human annotation to systematically assess the quality of the generated evolving instances beyond just correctness? 

10. How might the environmental impact and energy consumption during large-scale deployment of this framework be mitigated, especially considering the extensive use of LLMs?
