# [Complementary Recommendation in E-commerce: Definition, Approaches, and   Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16135)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional product recommendation systems often recommend too similar or homogeneous products, lacking diversity. Complementary recommendation aims to address this by recommending products that can be used together with products the user has already purchased or browsed. 
- However, there is limited existing review work on complementary recommendation solutions, especially recent advances, and existing reviews have limitations in comprehensively covering aspects like modeling methods, recommendation models, and experimental analyses.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper provides a comprehensive review of 34 representative studies on complementary recommendation in e-commerce between 2009-2024, analyzing:
   - Methods for modeling complementary relationships between products, including based on content, purchase sequences, and relationship graphs
   - Complementary recommendation models categorized by problem focuses like diversity, personalization, cold-start, scenario-based, etc.  
   - Experimental dataset analyses and comparative results
- The paper also proposes detailed future research directions to advance this field further, including new semantic/usage/quantitative modeling perspectives, sequential recommendations, issues with new user/items, diversity/personalization/timeliness considerations, usage of large language models, and handling complex real-world data.

Main Contributions:
- Much more comprehensive and up-to-date review compared to only 1 previous survey paper on this topic from 2019 that covered 1994-2018 period
- Detailed coverage of modeling methods and how relationships are predicted, vs high-level categorizations in existing work  
- Comparative experimental result analyses to evaluate model effectiveness
- Actionable future research directions addressing limitations like reliance on co-purchase signals, personalized sequential recommendations, leveraging advanced models like LLMs, etc.

In summary, this paper significantly pushes forward the understanding of progress made in complementary recommendations and areas needing focus to enable their enhanced real-world application and business value.
