# [Momentor: Advancing Video Large Language Model with Fine-Grained   Temporal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11435)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video large language models (Video-LLMs) capture only coarse-grained semantics and cannot effectively handle tasks related to comprehension or localization of specific video segments. 
- They lack effective temporal representation to precisely encode time positions and express them accurately in outputs. Using text timestamps suffers from precision variability and tokenization complexity.
- Current models also lack segment-level modeling and focus only on global visual semantics rather than relationships between segments.

Proposed Solution:

- Propose Momentor, a Video-LLM capable of accomplishing fine-grained temporal understanding tasks.

- Introduce Temporal Perception Module to flexibly represent accurate temporal positions and inject temporal information into frame features. It uses a continuous temporal token space with interpolation for precise temporal positioning.

- Employ a neighboring token propagation mechanism to strengthen continuity among temporal tokens.

- Propose Grounded Event-Sequence Modeling pre-training stage which trains Momentor to ground each event and caption the corresponding segment with aligned timestamps. Enables segment-level reasoning.

- Construct Moment-10M, a large-scale video instruction dataset with over 10M segment-level annotations to train Momentor. Data comprises 1.5M segments and 451K instance tracks over 7,260 hours.

- Design both single-segment and cross-segment tasks to enable comprehensive reasoning. 

Main Contributions:

- Momentor architecture with Temporal Perception Module for fine-grained temporal modeling and awareness

- Grounded Event-Sequence Modeling methodology to facilitate segment-level comprehension 

- Moment-10M dataset with 10M instructions across 1.5M segments for segment-level reasoning

- State-of-the-art performance on temporal grounding, dense captioning and other fine-grained tasks

In summary, the paper proposes an effective Video-LLM architecture, training methodology and dataset to significantly advance video understanding, especially for fine-grained temporal reasoning tasks.
