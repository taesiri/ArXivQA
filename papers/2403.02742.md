# [Towards Training A Chinese Large Language Model for Anesthesiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing medical language models focus on general medical knowledge, with few exploring domain-specific areas like anesthesiology. However, building models for niche medical fields is challenging due to limited publicly available training data.  

Proposed Solution - Hypnos:
- Implements a cross-filtering strategy to obtain high-quality training data from multiple existing LLMs, using one LLM to score another's generated data.
- Employs a general-to-specific training approach, first tuning on general medical data then fine-tuning on anesthesiology data specifically. This allows Hypnos to leverage broader medical knowledge while specializing.
- Introduces a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLMs on anesthesiology, with public test cases plus private hospital data.

Main Contributions:
1) A novel cross-filtering technique to improve quality of self-supervised data from existing LLMs.
2) A general-to-specific training strategy that transfers knowledge from general medical models before specializing to anesthesiology.  
3) The first standardized benchmark for testing medical LLMs on anesthesiology knowledge, including both public and private test data.

Experiments show Hypnos outperforms prior medical chatbots on anesthesiology data in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluations. The techniques help address the key challenge of limited domain-specific data availability.
