# [ControlNet-XS: Designing an Efficient and Effective Architecture for   Controlling Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06573)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes ControlNet-XS, a new architecture for controlling pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. The key insight is that existing control networks like ControlNet suffer from a delay in information flow between the generation and control processes, forcing the control network to have generative capabilities to "guess" what the generator will do next. ControlNet-XS eliminates this delay by enabling direct communication between the encoders of the generator and controller. As a result, ControlNet-XS needs far fewer parameters than ControlNet yet achieves better image quality, control fidelity, and 2x faster inference/training. For example, a 20M parameter ControlNet-XS can control the 2.6B parameter Stable Diffusion XL model. Ablation studies validate the architecture choices, and sensitivity analysis reveals that controller blocks mainly influence encoder blocks. Overall, by resolving the delayed information flow issue, ControlNet-XS can focus purely on controlling, enabling an efficient and effective design. Code and models are released to facilitate further research.
