## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more high-quality and diverse instruction datasets to cover broader capabilities and improve instruction tuning performance. The authors note that existing instruction datasets are still limited in scale, diversity, and creativity. 

- Exploring different methods to generate high-quality instruction-output pairs at scale, beyond relying solely on human labeling or querying LLMs. This could involve techniques like data augmentation, combining human and machine labeling, etc.

- Conducting more in-depth analysis into what knowledge and capabilities instruction-tuned models actually acquire. The authors suggest further probing whether models truly learn and comprehend tasks fully versus just capturing surface patterns.

- Developing techniques to make instruction tuning more efficient and scalable, such as optimal low-rank adaptation methods. Reducing the computational overhead of fine-tuning massive models is an active area of research.

- Applying instruction tuning to more modalities beyond just text, such as images, video, speech and multi-modal domains. Instruction tuning for broader capabilities is still relatively unexplored.

- Adapting instruction tuning to more specialized domains like medicine, law, science, etc. where reliability and accuracy are critical. Evaluating safety and controllability of models fine-tuned on domain instructions is important future work.

- Improving adherence to instructions and handling of unanticipated situations during inference. Models still struggle with some types of instructions and can behave unpredictably.

In summary, the main future directions focus on diversifying and scaling up instruction datasets, conducting deeper evaluation of models, expanding efficient tuning methods, applying instruction tuning to new modalities/domains, and enhancing instruction adherence during inference.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an instruction tuning approach for enhancing the capabilities and controllability of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to further train LLMs using paired data of (instruction, output), where the instruction specifies a task and the output is the desired response. The instruction dataset is constructed either by transforming existing labeled datasets into instruction-output pairs or by generating outputs using LLMs given human-provided instructions. The pre-trained LLM is then fine-tuned on this instruction dataset in a supervised manner to minimize the prediction error of generating the output sequence. Additional techniques like reinforcement learning with human preferences can further enhance the instruction-following capability. Overall, this instruction tuning method bridges the gap between the original pre-training objective of LLMs and the goal of adapting LLMs to follow human instructions in a helpful, safe, and controllable manner. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of instruction tuning in improving LLMs' capabilities on new tasks with limited data.
