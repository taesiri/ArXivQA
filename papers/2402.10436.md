# [I Am Not Them: Fluid Identities and Persistent Out-group Bias in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are becoming pervasive, but can propagate harmful biases. Prior work shows biases in gender and political domains, but cultural bias is less explored.  
- Quantifying bias in LLMs is important as prolonged exposure may negatively influence user perceptions or decisions. 

Methodology:
- The authors develop a new method to quantify cultural and political bias in LLMs by assigning them specific social identities using personas and measuring their agreement with associated in-group vs out-group value questions.  
- They examine bias across 3 models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama), 6 languages (Western: English/French/German and Eastern: Chinese/Korean/Japanese), cultural domains (individualism vs collectivism), and political domains (liberal vs conservative).

Key Findings:
- LLMs exhibit substantial in-group favoritism and even greater out-group negativity when assigned a particular social identity, displaying human-like intergroup bias.
- The out-group bias is on average 3 times greater than the in-group bias across models and domains.  
- The bias persists under different hyperparameters, personas, languages, and question formats.
- Setting an opposing persona can counteract default political leanings in ChatGPT.

Implications:
- Prolonged LLM exposure risks influencing user perceptions/decisions towards embedded biases.  
- Out-group bias can engender misunderstandings and cultural tensions.
- Quantifying bias is critical; the method here can help track it over time.
- Counteracting prompts can mitigate bias, but better design is needed for accessibility. 

In summary, the key contribution is a new bias quantification method and findings that - similar to humans - LLMs exhibit a heightened negativity bias towards out-groups when imbued with a social identity across cultural and political domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores cultural and political biases in large language models by imbuing them with different social identities across multiple languages and finds substantial out-group discrimination relative to in-group favoritism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a new method to quantify out-group bias in large language models by applying concepts from social identity theory. Specifically, the authors:

1) Propose a way to imbue LLMs with a particular social identity using personas in prompts, which allows measuring the extent to which models discern in-group and out-group values. 

2) Compare cultural bias across Western and Eastern languages using validated survey questions on individualism and collectivism. This analysis builds on prior work showing LLMs fail to accommodate cultural diversity.

3) Examine out-group bias in the political domain using adapted political compass test questions. This tests the robustness of their methodology in another important societal domain.

4) Conduct extensive robustness checks by varying hyperparameters, survey designs, persona formats, and other models. This evaluates the sensitivity of the conclusions.

5) Discuss implications of the substantial out-group bias findings on user influence, especially on issues like opinion formation and voting. The authors suggest bias measurement will become more critical as people struggle to discern AI-generated text.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a social identity theory-grounded methodology to quantify in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination in LLMs, showing a heightened negativity bias exists similar to human perceptions. This allows better value alignment.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Out-group bias - The tendency to favor in-group values while rejecting out-group values to a greater degree. A core concept examined in relation to large language models. 

- Social identity theory - The psychological theory underlying concepts like in-group favoritism and out-group negativity bias. Used to understand intergroup perceptions.

- Cultural orientations - Collectivism and individualism used as cultural metrics. Contrast Eastern versus Western orientations.

- Multilingual analysis - Examines bias across English, German, French, Chinese, Korean, Japanese versions of models. Evaluates cultural representation.

- Political polarization - Concept employed in study replication using political values questions instead of cultural ones.

- Prompt engineering - Method to mitigate bias by counteracting default views or reducing uncertainty. Discussion on alignment.

- Persona prompts - Technique used to imbue models with particular identities based on descriptions. Allows quantification of cultural and political leanings.

The key focus areas are using social identity theory concepts to evaluate cross-cultural and political biases in large language models across languages. Prompt engineering methods are suggested to mitigate the observed out-group bias.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using validated cultural survey questions to examine individualism and collectivism biases in large language models. What are some limitations of relying solely on survey questions to capture complex cultural concepts like individualism and collectivism? Could incorporating more open-ended prompts provide additional insights?

2. The paper argues that assigning personas along cultural dimensions like individualism and collectivism causes large language models to exhibit in-group favoritism and out-group negativity, similar to human bias. Do you think this methodology accurately captures real human bias? What other techniques could be used to evaluate if and how AI systems emulate human biases?  

3. The authors set the temperature parameter to 1.0 to allow variability in model responses in order to reflect real-world application scenarios. How might the results differ if a lower temperature setting was used instead? What are the tradeoffs between determinism and randomness that need to be considered?

4. This paper focuses exclusively on cultural and political biases, but what other domains of human bias would be important to explore in AI systems? What methodology could be used to probe things like gender, racial, or religious biases using large language models?

5. The survey questions used in this study were originally designed for human participants. What are some of the limitations of repurposing these survey instruments for evaluating AI systems? How might the design of measurement tools need to change?  

6. The paper argues that prolonged exposure to culturally-misaligned AI systems could exacerbate tensions or negatively impact marginalized groups. However, no direct evidence of harm is provided. What kind of additional research is needed to substantiate these conjectures around real-world impacts?

7. The authors suggest that effective prompt engineering, like assigning opposing personas, could counteract some forms of bias in AI systems. Do you think this approach could work well in practice? What challenges still remain around deploying “debiasing” techniques?

8. While focused on large language models, do you think the findings around cultural and political biases generalize to other types of AI systems like computer vision models or recommendation algorithms? Why or why not?

9. The paper examines both political and cultural biases, but the methodologies used in each domain are slightly different (survey questions versus political compass test). Do you think a unified framework could be developed for evaluating AI biases across different contexts like culture and politics? What would that entail?

10. The authors surface some technical and regulatory strategies for addressing issues like political polarization from AI systems. In your view, what is the most urgent intervention needed around AI and media manipulation? Who should be responsible for that?
