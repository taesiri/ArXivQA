# [I Am Not Them: Fluid Identities and Persistent Out-group Bias in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are becoming pervasive, but can propagate harmful biases. Prior work shows biases in gender and political domains, but cultural bias is less explored.  
- Quantifying bias in LLMs is important as prolonged exposure may negatively influence user perceptions or decisions. 

Methodology:
- The authors develop a new method to quantify cultural and political bias in LLMs by assigning them specific social identities using personas and measuring their agreement with associated in-group vs out-group value questions.  
- They examine bias across 3 models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama), 6 languages (Western: English/French/German and Eastern: Chinese/Korean/Japanese), cultural domains (individualism vs collectivism), and political domains (liberal vs conservative).

Key Findings:
- LLMs exhibit substantial in-group favoritism and even greater out-group negativity when assigned a particular social identity, displaying human-like intergroup bias.
- The out-group bias is on average 3 times greater than the in-group bias across models and domains.  
- The bias persists under different hyperparameters, personas, languages, and question formats.
- Setting an opposing persona can counteract default political leanings in ChatGPT.

Implications:
- Prolonged LLM exposure risks influencing user perceptions/decisions towards embedded biases.  
- Out-group bias can engender misunderstandings and cultural tensions.
- Quantifying bias is critical; the method here can help track it over time.
- Counteracting prompts can mitigate bias, but better design is needed for accessibility. 

In summary, the key contribution is a new bias quantification method and findings that - similar to humans - LLMs exhibit a heightened negativity bias towards out-groups when imbued with a social identity across cultural and political domains.
