# [Improving Generalization in Semantic Parsing by Increasing Natural   Language Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-SQL semantic parsing models trained on Spider struggle to generalize to new datasets due to the lack of linguistic diversity in Spider questions. Questions in Spider tend to be overly explicit, directly mentioning database entities even when unnecessary.
- This causes models to overfit and fail when tested on minor perturbations or out-of-domain datasets with more natural language variations.

Proposed Solution:
- Use data augmentation to increase the natural language variation in Spider training data. 
- Leverage large language models (ChatGPT) to automatically generate question reformulations that are more natural and diverse.
- Devise prompts with instructions like simplification, synonym/substitution, rewriting, and paraphrasing to produce different types of augmentations.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of linguistic rewrite operations to make questions more natural and varied.
- Methodology to augment existing text-to-SQL datasets using large language models. 
- Empirical validation showing training on augmented Spider data improves model robustness and out-of-domain generalization.
- Models trained on augmented data outperform those trained on other specialized augmentation datasets.
- Achieves over 3% absolute improvement in robustness accuracy and 6% improvement in out-of-domain accuracy.

In summary, the paper presents an effective data augmentation approach using large language models and linguistic prompts to increase natural language diversity. This is shown through extensive experiments to significantly enhance model generalization on text-to-SQL semantic parsing.
