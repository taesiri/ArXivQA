# [Experimental Evaluation of Methods for Estimating Frequency Response   Functions of a 6-axes Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06276)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an experimental evaluation of different methods for estimating frequency response functions (FRFs) of a 6-axis industrial robot manipulator. The goal is to reduce experiment time while maintaining good model quality for control design. The classical nonparametric approach requires multiple experiments, whereas the local rational method (LRM) allows FRF estimation from a single experiment. The paper compares these techniques and proposes enhancements to LRM, including different parametrizations for the multivariable case and a joint input-output formulation. Experiments on a real robot show that LRM outperforms classical methods given the same short experiment time. Specifically, the joint input-output LRM approach combined with logarithmic averaging of estimates from multiple experiments provides the lowest bias. However, the parametric model identified from the FRFs is more accurate using classical averaging with more experiments. Thus, there is a trade-off between experiment time and modeling accuracy that needs consideration based on the intended model application. Key results demonstrate the promise of LRM for efficient FRF measurement, the importance of parametrization choice, and quantitatively compare quality versus experiment time.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Accurate dynamic models of robotic manipulators are needed for control design. Obtaining these models requires performing system identification experiments which can be time consuming. 
- The goal is to reduce experiment time while maintaining model quality. This is done by using efficient frequency response function (FRF) estimation methods prior to parametric model identification.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare classical nonparametric FRF estimation methods which require multiple experiments, to more efficient "local parametric" methods that allow FRF estimation from a single experiment. 
- Specifically, the Local Rational Method (LRM) is evaluated, using different parametrizations: MISO, MIMO, Joint Input-Output (JIO). 
- LRM estimates are enhanced by: (1) logarithmic averaging over multiple experiments, and (2) choosing suitable parametrizations that account for cross-channel dynamics.
- The resulting LRM FRF estimates are used as inputs for parametric model identification, and compared to classical nonparametric estimates.

Contributions:
- Show superior performance of JIO-LRM over classical methods for the same experiment time
- Demonstrate importance of cross-channel dynamics through better performance of MIMO vs MISO LRM 
- Show logarithmic averaging over multiple LRM experiments further improves estimates
- Determine suitable tradeoff between experiment time and model accuracy when using LRM estimates for parametric identification. JIO-LRM with limited experiments performs best.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that using efficient LRM FRF estimation methods allows reducing experiment time for robot model identification without compromising model accuracy. The results guide the choice of suitable LRM configurations and enhancement techniques for this application.
