# [Experimental Evaluation of Methods for Estimating Frequency Response   Functions of a 6-axes Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06276)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an experimental evaluation of different methods for estimating frequency response functions (FRFs) of a 6-axis industrial robot manipulator. The goal is to reduce experiment time while maintaining good model quality for control design. The classical nonparametric approach requires multiple experiments, whereas the local rational method (LRM) allows FRF estimation from a single experiment. The paper compares these techniques and proposes enhancements to LRM, including different parametrizations for the multivariable case and a joint input-output formulation. Experiments on a real robot show that LRM outperforms classical methods given the same short experiment time. Specifically, the joint input-output LRM approach combined with logarithmic averaging of estimates from multiple experiments provides the lowest bias. However, the parametric model identified from the FRFs is more accurate using classical averaging with more experiments. Thus, there is a trade-off between experiment time and modeling accuracy that needs consideration based on the intended model application. Key results demonstrate the promise of LRM for efficient FRF measurement, the importance of parametrization choice, and quantitatively compare quality versus experiment time.
