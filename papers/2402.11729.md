# [Prospector Heads: Generalized Feature Attribution for Large Models &amp;   Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Prospector Heads: Generalized Feature Attribution for Large Models & Data":

Problem:
Current machine learning models struggle to perform accurate feature attribution - identifying regions of the input data most responsible for a model's classification decision. Existing explanation-based methods rely on end-to-end classifiers and suffer from three key issues: 
(a) Require large labeled training datasets, but these are often unavailable, especially in scientific domains.  
(b) Computationally expensive due to reliance on classifier training or input perturbations.
(c) Attributions can be inaccurate and not capture features truly relevant for classification.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "prospector heads", a simple decoder module that can perform feature attribution for any pre-trained encoder model, including large foundation models (FMs). The key ideas are:

1) Interface with encoders by adapting their token embeddings rather than explaining classifier predictions. Builds on assumption that FMs learn useful data representations.  

2) Use two trainable layers: 
Layer I - Quantize tokens into semantic concepts via clustering 
Layer II - Learn spatial associations of concepts using graph convolution to identify class-relevant regions

3) Computationally efficient (linear time complexity) and data efficient (100s of parameters) unlike explanation methods.

4) Explicitly optimized for feature attribution using label information rather than explaining classifiers post-hoc.

The prospector framework is evaluated on three modalities: text, images, and graphs. Various encoders are equipped with prospector heads including domain-specific FMs like CLIP and protein language models.

Main Contributions:

1) Prospector heads significantly improve attribution performance (AUCPR) over baselines by up to 49 points, generalizing across modalities and encoder types. Robust to differences in prevalence and dispersion of target regions.

2) Choice of encoder impacts prospector performance - specialized FMs further improve results in images and graphs.

3) Visualizations of concepts and learned weights enable model interpretability and discovery of dataset patterns. For proteins, discovered mechanistic subgroups related to zinc binding sites.

Overall, prospectors provide an efficient, accurate and interpretable approach to feature attribution for large models and complex data where traditional explanation methods struggle. Their flexibility and generalizability facilitate integration with FMs for improved model transparency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces prospector heads, a simple and efficient method to equip foundation models with interpretable and accurate feature attribution capabilities for high-dimensional biomedical data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of "prospector heads", which is a simple decoder module that can equip feature attribution capabilities to any encoder, including foundation models. Specifically, prospector heads:

- Are parameter-efficient, enabling data efficiency
- Are computationally efficient due to linear scaling and no requirement for backpropagation 
- Improve localization accuracy compared to explanation-based attribution methods
- Generalize across modalities (tested on sequences, images, graphs)
- Are interpretable due to the use of learned concepts and visualizations of the prospector internals

In the experiments, prospector heads outperformed baseline attribution methods across all three data modalities, often by a large margin. The paper emphasizes prospectors as an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional explanation-based feature attribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Feature attribution - The ability to localize regions of the input data that are relevant for classification. A key capability for machine learning models in scientific and biomedical domains.

- Foundation models (FMs) - Large, pretrained language models that learn high quality data representations and can learn class-specific properties through a few labeled examples.

- Prospector heads - The proposed method in the paper. A simple decoder module built on top of foundation model representations to perform feature attribution. Contains two layers: a quantization layer that categorizes tokens into concepts, and a convolution layer that scores tokens based on concept frequencies and co-occurrences.

- Computational efficiency - Prospector heads aim to be efficient in terms of computation time and number of parameters in order to scale to large and high-dimensional datasets. Use efficient primitives like linear-time convolution and learnable dictionaries.

- Interpretability - Prospector heads aim to be more interpretable than black-box models. Visualizations of parameters and outputs provided in terms of learned concepts to facilitate human-in-the-loop development.

- Generalizability - Experiments conducted on multiple data modalities: sequences (text), images (pathology), and graphs (protein structures). Show improved performance over baseline attribution methods in all domains.

In summary, the key ideas focus on a new technique called prospector heads that leverages foundation models to perform efficient, accurate, and interpretable feature attribution across different data types.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the prospector heads method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper mentions prospector heads are more data efficient than explanation-based methods. What specifically allows them to operate effectively in low-data regimes compared to other attribution techniques? How is the inductive bias different?

2) Prospector heads rely on an initial step of clustering token embeddings into semantic concepts. How does the choice of clustering algorithm impact model performance? Is there an optimal number of concepts to use? 

3) The prospect map convolution operates by scoring concept monograms and skip-bigrams. What is the intuition behind using skip-bigrams versus higher-order $n$-grams? How does skip distance relate to the size of target regions?

4) Two approaches are proposed for scoring concepts in the prospector head: a linear model versus fold-change. What are the tradeoffs between these approaches? When would one be preferred over the other? 

5) How exactly does operating on token embeddings rather than whole-datum embeddings confer advantages? What types of spatial dependencies can prospector heads capture that other methods may miss?

6) The results show prospector performance depends greatly on encoder choice. What encoder properties lead to the best attribution performance? How can we optimize or select encoders to maximize gains?

7) The visualizations of data sprites and kernels provide interpretability. What novel biological insights could be gained from inspecting these model internals in scientific applications?

8) How do design choices like token resolution and connectivity impact what patterns prospectors can capture? What data characteristics are they best suited or ill-suited for?

9) The method trains attribution in a target class-specific manner. How difficult would it be to extend to multi-class attribution simultaneously? What algorithmic changes would that require?

10) Prospector heads currently operate on static graphs. What complications arise from adapting them to handle dynamic graphs? What types of architectures or training procedures need to change?
