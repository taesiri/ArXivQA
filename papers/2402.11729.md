## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Prospector Heads: Generalized Feature Attribution for Large Models & Data":

Problem:
Current machine learning models struggle to perform accurate feature attribution - identifying regions of the input data most responsible for a model's classification decision. Existing explanation-based methods rely on end-to-end classifiers and suffer from three key issues: 
(a) Require large labeled training datasets, but these are often unavailable, especially in scientific domains.  
(b) Computationally expensive due to reliance on classifier training or input perturbations.
(c) Attributions can be inaccurate and not capture features truly relevant for classification.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "prospector heads", a simple decoder module that can perform feature attribution for any pre-trained encoder model, including large foundation models (FMs). The key ideas are:

1) Interface with encoders by adapting their token embeddings rather than explaining classifier predictions. Builds on assumption that FMs learn useful data representations.  

2) Use two trainable layers: 
Layer I - Quantize tokens into semantic concepts via clustering 
Layer II - Learn spatial associations of concepts using graph convolution to identify class-relevant regions

3) Computationally efficient (linear time complexity) and data efficient (100s of parameters) unlike explanation methods.

4) Explicitly optimized for feature attribution using label information rather than explaining classifiers post-hoc.

The prospector framework is evaluated on three modalities: text, images, and graphs. Various encoders are equipped with prospector heads including domain-specific FMs like CLIP and protein language models.

Main Contributions:

1) Prospector heads significantly improve attribution performance (AUCPR) over baselines by up to 49 points, generalizing across modalities and encoder types. Robust to differences in prevalence and dispersion of target regions.

2) Choice of encoder impacts prospector performance - specialized FMs further improve results in images and graphs.

3) Visualizations of concepts and learned weights enable model interpretability and discovery of dataset patterns. For proteins, discovered mechanistic subgroups related to zinc binding sites.

Overall, prospectors provide an efficient, accurate and interpretable approach to feature attribution for large models and complex data where traditional explanation methods struggle. Their flexibility and generalizability facilitate integration with FMs for improved model transparency.
