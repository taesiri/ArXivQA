# [Atom-Level Optical Chemical Structure Recognition with Limited   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01743)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for chemical structure recognition from images typically require rich supervision in the form of bounding box annotations for each atom and bond. However, such detailed annotations are often unavailable for real-world datasets like hand-drawn molecule images. This limits the applicability of current methods.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a new method called AtomLenz that can perform chemical structure recognition from images using only image-level SMILES annotation for supervision. It uses an object detection backbone to predict atom-level entities like atoms, bonds, charges, stereocenters. A graph construction algorithm then assembles a molecular graph from these predictions. 

The key innovation is a weakly supervised training mechanism that allows fine-tuning the object detector on target domains with only image-SMILES pairs, without needing bounding box supervision. This uses two techniques:
1) ProbKT* - Uses probabilistic programming and logical constraints from SMILES to supervise the object detector.
2) Edit-correction - Detects and fixes small errors in predictions to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning.

The method also proposes ChemExpert which combines predictions from AtomLenz and other methods like DECIMER, choosing the chemically valid prediction.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes first method to perform chemical structure recognition from images with atom-level localization using only SMILES supervision.
2) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand-drawn images using 10-2000x less training data than prior arts. 
3) Demonstrates improved sample efficiency and accuracy compared to previous methods.
4) Releases new dataset of 1417 hand-drawn images with atom-level annotations.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative weakly supervised approach for chemical structure recognition that works effectively even with limited annotation, enabling the method's use across different challenging real-world domains.
