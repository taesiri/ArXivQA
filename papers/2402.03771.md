# [Reinforcement Learning from Bagged Reward: A Transformer-based Approach   for Instance-Level Reward Redistribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03771)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically assume that an instant reward signal is provided after each action taken by the agent. However, in many real-world applications, only cumulative/aggregated rewards are provided after a sequence of actions, termed as "reward bags". This is challenging since the agent does not have access to the actual per-step rewards to effectively learn the policy.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new RL setting called Reinforcement Learning from Bagged Rewards (RLBR) to handle such cases. In RLBR, the environment provides a cumulative "bagged" reward after each sequence of actions instead of per-step rewards. To address this, the paper proposes a Transformer-based model called Reward Bag Transformer (RBT) which can predict the per-step rewards within each bag for more effective policy learning.

Key Ideas:
- Formally define the RLBR setting using Bagged Reward MDPs (BRMDPs) which provide bagged rewards. Show theoretically that optimizing policies under BRMDP matches optimizing under original MDP.
- Propose the RBT model which uses self-attention to understand contextual relationships between states/actions within each bag and predict per-step rewards. Also forecasts next states. 
- RBT model is jointly optimized along with the policy by redistributing predicted per-step rewards to replay buffer to enhance policy learning.

Key Results:
- RBT significantly outperforms prior methods for delayed/trajectory rewards in various MuJoCo environments under bagged reward settings.
- Case studies show RBT can accurately mimic ground truth per-step rewards just from bagged rewards. 
- Ablations validate attention mechanism and state forecasting help reward prediction.

In summary, the paper introduces a practical RL setting for bagged rewards and proposes an effective Transformer-based solution (RBT) for accurately redistributing rewards for efficient policy optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Transformer-based reward redistribution method for reinforcement learning problems with bagged rewards, where rewards are only provided at the end of sequences of actions rather than for each individual action.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It establishes a new reinforcement learning setting called Reinforcement Learning from Bagged Rewards (RLBR), where agents only obtain rewards at the end of bags (sequences of states and actions) rather than instant rewards for each step. The paper provides theoretical analysis to connect RLBR to standard MDPs.

2. It proposes a Transformer-based reward model called the Reward Bag Transformer (RBT) to redistribute the bagged rewards to individual states and actions. The RBT uses self-attention to understand the contextual relevance and temporal dependencies within each bag.  

3. It develops an algorithm that alternates between optimizing the RBT reward model and the policy, enhancing the effectiveness of both components.

4. It demonstrates through experiments that the proposed method outperforms prior approaches for delayed rewards, especially in environments with long reward bags. The experiments also validate that RBT can accurately predict rewards and mimic the original MDP's reward distribution.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of the RLBR setting and the RBT model to effectively learn policies from bagged, non-instant rewards, along with theoretical and experimental support.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Reinforcement Learning from Bagged Rewards (RLBR): A novel RL setting where agents only obtain rewards at the end of "bags" (sequences of state-action pairs) rather than instant rewards for each transition.

- Bagged Markov Decision Process (BRMDP): An extension of the traditional MDP framework to model the RLBR setting with bagged rewards.

- Reward redistribution: The process of assigning instance-level rewards to each state-action pair within a bag based on the bag's total reward. Critical for learning in the RLBR setting.  

- Reward Bag Transformer (RBT): The proposed Transformer-based model for interpreting context within bags and redistributing bagged rewards to individual instances. Uses self-attention and next state prediction.

- Contextual understanding: The ability to interpret the sequential context and temporal dependencies within a bag to determine the contribution of each state-action pair. The RBT leverages self-attention for this.

- Policy optimization: Alternating between optimizing the RBT reward model and the agent's policy to enhance learning in the RLBR setting.

Some other potentially relevant terms are attention mechanism, transformers, sequence modeling, delayed/sparse rewards, sample efficiency, and credit assignment.
