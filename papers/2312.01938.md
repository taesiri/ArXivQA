# [DSText V2: A Comprehensive Video Text Spotting Dataset for Dense and   Small Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video text datasets and benchmarks focus on easy cases like normal text size and density, ignoring challenges of dense and small text in videos across scenarios. 
- Lack of high-quality datasets with diverse, challenging video scenarios to advance video text spotting research and applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce DSText V2 benchmark with 140 videos over 62K frames containing 2.2M text instances across 7 scenarios.

Main Features:  
- High density (avg 42 texts/frame) and high proportion small text (avg size 1758 pixels): New challenges compared to existing datasets.
- Diverse scenarios: Driving, sports, street views etc. with special focus on dense small text.
- Comprehensive tasks and metrics: Detection, tracking, end-to-end spotting tasks supported along with metrics like IDF1, MOTA.

Key Contributions:
- Collected and annotated high-quality, challenging video text dataset advancing the field. 
- In-depth data analysis providing distribution across scenarios, text sizes, density etc.
- Experimental analysis validating challenges posed by small and dense text scenarios.  
- Benchmark helping standardize evaluation and foster further innovations in video text spotting.

The paper introduces unique challenges posed by dense small scene text in videos, backed by a rich dataset and extensive experiments, to push state-of-the-art in video text spotting.
