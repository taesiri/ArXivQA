## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the application of Vision Transformer models in Autonomous Driving (AD), exploring their potential to transform the field. 

The problem tackled is the limitations of traditional deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in effectively capturing long-range dependencies and global contexts crucial for autonomous driving. Transformers excel in sequential image processing and global context capture, which are fundamental in AD for real-time and dynamic visual scene understanding. 

The proposed solution is the adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are Transformers tailored for computer vision tasks, for crucial aspects of autonomous driving including perception, prediction and planning. The survey provides an in-depth analysis of ViT advancements across key 3D perception tasks like object detection, segmentation and tracking, where they leverage capabilities like deformable attention and multimodal fusion for enhanced accuracy. Significant progress is also seen in 2D tasks such as lane detection, segmentation and HD map creation. The survey also highlights the emergence of ViTs in end-to-end AD systems for trajectory forecasting and planning.

The main contributions of the paper are:
1) Comprehensive analysis of Vision Transformer architecture, self-attention mechanisms, advantages over CNNs and RNNs.
2) Extensive coverage of impactful Vision Transformer applications spanning 3D perception, 2D perception, prediction and planning in AD. Models analyzed include DETR3D, PETR, BEVFormer, PersFormer, WayFormer etc.
3) Identification of key challenges in model complexity, efficiency, safety and directions like multimodal fusion, hardware acceleration for future research.

In summary, this paper offers an all-encompassing overview of the great potential and critical role of Vision Transformers in advancing Autonomous Driving technology through their specialized capabilities in dynamic scene understanding.
