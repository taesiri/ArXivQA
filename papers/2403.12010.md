# [VideoMV: Consistent Multi-View Generation Based on Large Video   Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating consistent and high-quality multi-view images from a single image or text prompt is very challenging. Prior works suffer from issues like multi-face janus problem, content drifting, lack of generalizability, and slow optimization process. The key challenges are - what data and models to use for pre-training that can learn strong multi-view consistency patterns, and how to enforce an underlying 3D model to improve multi-view consistency.

Proposed Solution - VideoMV:
1) Uses video generation models (like ModelScope T2V and I2VGen XL) pretrained on large-scale video data as the base model. Video data inherently captures multi-view consistency patterns better. Fine-tunes the video models on multi-view rendered images to get a multi-view generative model.

2) Proposes a novel 3D-aware denoising sampling strategy - employs a feedforward network to reconstruct an explicit 3D Gaussian model from the generated multi-view images. Renders this 3D model to get images, and uses them to guide the denoising sampling process of the generator. This further improves multi-view consistency.

Main Contributions:
1) Shows how to effectively build a multi-view generative model by fine-tuning large video generation models, to inherit their strong priors. Converges much faster than prior arts.

2) Introduces an explicit 3D-aware denoising sampling strategy to significantly enhance multi-view consistency over the base video generation model.

3) Experiments show state-of-the-art performance than prior works like MVDream, SyncDreamer etc. in terms of efficiency, visual quality, consistency metrics etc.

4) The reconstructed explicit 3D model can also be used for downstream tasks like novel view synthesis, 3D editing, neural rendering etc.

In summary, VideoMV makes important contributions in using self-supervised video priors for multi-view synthesis, and enforcing consistency via explicit 3D geometric guidance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces VideoMV, a novel approach for consistent multi-view image generation that leverages video generative priors and a 3D-aware denoising strategy to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of efficiency, quality, and consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing VideoMV, a novel approach for consistent multi-view image generation that is fine-tuned from off-the-shelf video generative models. This leverages the strong temporal consistency in video models to improve multi-view consistency.

2) Introducing a novel 3D-aware denoising sampling strategy that involves rendered images from an explicitly reconstructed 3D model to further improve multi-view consistency of the generated images.

3) Extensive experiments demonstrating that VideoMV outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both efficiency and quality for multi-view image generation. For example, it achieves better consistency metrics than MVDream while requiring much less GPU hours to train.

In summary, the key ideas are to leverage video generation models and an explicit 3D reconstruction model to achieve high-quality and consistent multi-view image generation more efficiently than prior arts. The proposed VideoMV framework makes important contributions along both of these directions.
