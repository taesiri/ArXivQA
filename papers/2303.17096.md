# [ImageNet-E: Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness via Attribute Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17096)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that evaluating robustness of image classifiers on object attributes like background, size, position, and direction can provide new insights into model accuracy and robustness. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:- Evaluating model performance on edited images that change object attributes can reveal vulnerabilities and facilitate debugging. This is in contrast to existing robustness benchmarks that focus on out-of-distribution corruptions.- Models that achieve high accuracy on ImageNet are still sensitive to small changes in object attributes like background complexity, size, position, and direction.- Improving robustness against these attribute changes may require different techniques compared to improving robustness against common corruptions or adversarial examples.To test these hypotheses, the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset called ImageNet-E that contains images with edited object attributes. They then evaluate various state-of-the-art models on this benchmark and analyze their sensitivity to different attribute changes. The results reveal interesting vulnerabilities and opportunities for improving robustness through architecture designs, training strategies, and preprocessing.In summary, the central hypothesis is that object attributes represent a new dimension for evaluating and improving model robustness complementary to existing benchmarks. ImageNet-E is proposed to facilitate research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- They provide an object editing toolkit that can control object attributes like background, size, position, and direction for manipulated image generation. This allows creating datasets to evaluate model robustness to different object attributes.- They create a new dataset called ImageNet-E based on their toolkit and ImageNet. ImageNet-E can serve as a benchmark for evaluating robustness to changes in object attributes. It provides a new way to test model robustness compared to existing datasets focused on out-of-distribution corruptions.- They evaluate various deep learning models on ImageNet-E, including CNNs and vision transformers. They find most models are quite sensitive to attribute changes, with even small background changes dropping accuracy significantly.- They explore ways to enhance robustness against object attribute changes through preprocessing, network architecture changes, and training strategies. For example, they show masked autoencoder pretraining can help improve robustness.In summary, the main contribution is providing a new dataset and benchmark methodology focused on evaluating robustness to object attribute changes rather than out-of-distribution corruptions. Their experiments highlight the sensitivity of current models and provide insights into improving robustness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces ImageNet-E, a new robustness benchmark dataset created by editing object attributes in ImageNet images, for evaluating deep learning models' robustness to controlled changes in backgrounds, sizes, positions, and orientations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on evaluating and improving the robustness of image classifiers:- The focus on creating a benchmark dataset for evaluating robustness to different object attributes like background, size, position, etc. is novel. Most prior robustness benchmarks like ImageNet-C and ImageNet-A focus on simulated corruptions or adversarial examples. Creating a dataset to systematically evaluate attribute robustness opens up a new direction for research.- The approach of editing images while trying to maintain proximity to the original data distribution is interesting. Many prior approaches like ObjectNet or ImageNet-9 rely on pasting objects on new backgrounds, which can make the distribution quite different. Using diffusion models for smoother editing is a nicer way to benchmark attribute robustness.- The findings that standard trained and even adversarially robust models can still be quite brittle to attribute changes highlights that there are still open challenges in building truly robust models. Much prior work assumed adversarial training would confer robustness more broadly.- The experiments on model architectures, training procedures, etc. to improve attribute robustness provide useful insights. In particular, the benefits of self-supervised pretraining with MAE and incorporation of self-attention are notable findings.Overall, I think this paper makes a nice contribution in formally introducing and evaluating a new facet of robustness - attribute robustness - which hasn't been systematically studied before. The dataset and benchmarks introduced could catalyze more research in this area. The analysis also highlights that robustness is still an open challenge and that successes on one benchmark don't necessarily transfer to others.
