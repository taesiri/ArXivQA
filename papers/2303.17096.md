# [ImageNet-E: Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness via Attribute Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17096)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that evaluating robustness of image classifiers on object attributes like background, size, position, and direction can provide new insights into model accuracy and robustness. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:- Evaluating model performance on edited images that change object attributes can reveal vulnerabilities and facilitate debugging. This is in contrast to existing robustness benchmarks that focus on out-of-distribution corruptions.- Models that achieve high accuracy on ImageNet are still sensitive to small changes in object attributes like background complexity, size, position, and direction.- Improving robustness against these attribute changes may require different techniques compared to improving robustness against common corruptions or adversarial examples.To test these hypotheses, the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset called ImageNet-E that contains images with edited object attributes. They then evaluate various state-of-the-art models on this benchmark and analyze their sensitivity to different attribute changes. The results reveal interesting vulnerabilities and opportunities for improving robustness through architecture designs, training strategies, and preprocessing.In summary, the central hypothesis is that object attributes represent a new dimension for evaluating and improving model robustness complementary to existing benchmarks. ImageNet-E is proposed to facilitate research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- They provide an object editing toolkit that can control object attributes like background, size, position, and direction for manipulated image generation. This allows creating datasets to evaluate model robustness to different object attributes.- They create a new dataset called ImageNet-E based on their toolkit and ImageNet. ImageNet-E can serve as a benchmark for evaluating robustness to changes in object attributes. It provides a new way to test model robustness compared to existing datasets focused on out-of-distribution corruptions.- They evaluate various deep learning models on ImageNet-E, including CNNs and vision transformers. They find most models are quite sensitive to attribute changes, with even small background changes dropping accuracy significantly.- They explore ways to enhance robustness against object attribute changes through preprocessing, network architecture changes, and training strategies. For example, they show masked autoencoder pretraining can help improve robustness.In summary, the main contribution is providing a new dataset and benchmark methodology focused on evaluating robustness to object attribute changes rather than out-of-distribution corruptions. Their experiments highlight the sensitivity of current models and provide insights into improving robustness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces ImageNet-E, a new robustness benchmark dataset created by editing object attributes in ImageNet images, for evaluating deep learning models' robustness to controlled changes in backgrounds, sizes, positions, and orientations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on evaluating and improving the robustness of image classifiers:- The focus on creating a benchmark dataset for evaluating robustness to different object attributes like background, size, position, etc. is novel. Most prior robustness benchmarks like ImageNet-C and ImageNet-A focus on simulated corruptions or adversarial examples. Creating a dataset to systematically evaluate attribute robustness opens up a new direction for research.- The approach of editing images while trying to maintain proximity to the original data distribution is interesting. Many prior approaches like ObjectNet or ImageNet-9 rely on pasting objects on new backgrounds, which can make the distribution quite different. Using diffusion models for smoother editing is a nicer way to benchmark attribute robustness.- The findings that standard trained and even adversarially robust models can still be quite brittle to attribute changes highlights that there are still open challenges in building truly robust models. Much prior work assumed adversarial training would confer robustness more broadly.- The experiments on model architectures, training procedures, etc. to improve attribute robustness provide useful insights. In particular, the benefits of self-supervised pretraining with MAE and incorporation of self-attention are notable findings.Overall, I think this paper makes a nice contribution in formally introducing and evaluating a new facet of robustness - attribute robustness - which hasn't been systematically studied before. The dataset and benchmarks introduced could catalyze more research in this area. The analysis also highlights that robustness is still an open challenge and that successes on one benchmark don't necessarily transfer to others.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending their object editing toolkit to support weakly supervised object localization, so it does not require annotation masks and can be applied more broadly. - Exploring how to leverage the edited data to enhance model performance, including both validation accuracy and robustness. The authors did a small experiment on model repairing by training on edited data, but more work could be done here.- Evaluating robustness of models on editing more types of attributes beyond just background, size, position and orientation. For example, occlusions, lighting, etc.- Applying insights from analysis on ImageNet-E to improve clean accuracy on the original ImageNet dataset. The authors suggest object attribute robustness could indicate progress in representation learning.- Developing new models and architectural modifications specifically aimed at improving robustness to attribute changes, since many current robustness techniques did not help much.- Expanding the ImageNet-E dataset by editing more classes and images. The current dataset is relatively compact due to limitations of the editing tool.- Comparing robustness of different self-supervised and contrastive learning methods using ImageNet-E, since the authors found MAE performed well but MoCo-v3 did not.So in summary, the main directions are developing the dataset and editing tools further, using ImageNet-E for model analysis and improvement, and exploring new techniques to improve robustness to attribute changes specifically. The dataset enables a new axis for evaluating and improving model robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset called ImageNet-E for benchmarking the robustness of image classifiers to object attribute changes. The authors develop a toolkit to edit object attributes like background, size, position, and orientation in images while maintaining proximity to the original ImageNet distribution. Using this toolkit, they construct ImageNet-E from ImageNet images with 373 animal classes and control different object attributes in the edited images. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-E with various convolutional and transformer models show these models are quite sensitive to attribute changes, with even small background changes causing large drops in accuracy. The authors find that models with higher ImageNet accuracy and larger model capacity tend to be more robust to attribute changes. They also explore different strategies like data augmentation and masked modeling to improve robustness. Overall, ImageNet-E enables model debugging and analysis of model sensitivity to object attributes, providing a new direction for improving model robustness within the original data distribution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new dataset called ImageNet-E for benchmarking the robustness of image classifiers. ImageNet-E contains edited versions of images from ImageNet where object attributes like background, size, position and orientation have been systematically changed. This allows evaluating how robust models are to variations in these attributes, which is relevant for real-world deployment. The authors demonstrate that ImageNet-E poses a new challenge - many models, including adversarially trained ones, perform much worse compared to on the original ImageNet images. They analyze the performance of various state-of-the-art models like ResNets, Vision Transformers and CLIP and find significant drops in accuracy on ImageNet-E compared to ImageNet. The paper makes a case for benchmarking robustness to semantic image edits in addition to existing out-of-distribution robustness benchmarks. The introduced toolkit for image editing and the ImageNet-E dataset enable future work on making models more robust to variations in object attributes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new dataset called ImageNet-E for evaluating image classifier robustness in terms of different object attributes. To construct ImageNet-E, the authors develop an object editing toolkit that can manipulate images to change object backgrounds, sizes, positions and directions. Specifically, they use diffusion models to edit the background coherently and perform orthogonal transforms on the segmented object to control its size, position and orientation. This toolkit is applied to images from ImageNet to generate the ImageNet-E dataset containing controllable edits to object attributes while maintaining proximity to the original data distribution. ImageNet-E serves as a benchmark for model evaluation - the authors test several state-of-the-art models on it and find most are quite sensitive to attribute changes, with some robust models actually performing worse than vanilla models. The paper aims to provide a new perspective and dataset for research on robust computer vision.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes a new dataset called ImageNet-E for evaluating the robustness of image classifiers to different object attributes like background, size, position, and orientation. - It provides an object editing toolkit to generate images with controlled changes to these attributes, while keeping the images close to the original ImageNet distribution.- It evaluates several CNN and Transformer models on ImageNet-E and finds they are quite sensitive to attribute changes, with background changes causing the biggest drops in accuracy.- It discovers robustness can be improved via preprocessing, architecture designs, and training strategies. For example, self-attention helps over CNNs, and masked autoencoding is better than contrastive self-supervised pretraining.- The key motivation is that rather than just test on out-of-distribution corruptions, it is important to debug models on in-distribution data by evaluating sensitivity to object attributes. This can provide insights into model weaknesses and how to improve accuracy and robustness.In summary, the main contribution is the new benchmark and editing toolkit for evaluating robustness to object attributes in a controlled way, in order to better understand model limitations and improve accuracy and robustness.
