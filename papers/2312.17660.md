# [Normalization of Lithuanian Text Using Regular Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17660)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-speech (TTS) systems need to handle non-standard words (NSWs) like numbers, dates, abbreviations etc. that belong to other semiotic systems besides natural language. 
- These NSWs need to be expanded into ordinary words in a process called text normalization before feeding them into the TTS system. 
- Text normalization is language-dependent and requires defining taxonomy of semiotic classes, rules for identifying and expanding NSWs for a given language like Lithuanian.

Proposed Solution: 
- Paper presents taxonomy of NSWs adapted for Lithuanian comprising numbers, letters, other symbols like URLs.
- Rules are proposed based on regular expressions to identify NSWs and expand them into natural text. Rules handle various formats of numbers, dates, times, expand abbreviations etc.
- Rules insert special tags to mark grammatical features like number, case etc. to get correct word forms.
- Experiments conducted on 3 diverse Lithuanian datasets - news articles, university website content and car navigation text.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive taxonomy of Lithuanian NSWs for text normalization.
- Large set of regular expression rules to identify and expand different classes of NSWs.
- Handles various formats of numbers, dates, times, abbreviations.
- Special tags used effectively to generate correct morphological forms.
- Tested on diverse datasets showing reasonable accuracy. 
- Analyzes errors providing insights into future improvements.
- Useful for developing Lithuanian text-to-speech synthesis systems.

In summary, the paper presents a text normalization solution for Lithuanian to expand non-standard words like numbers, dates etc. into natural text using regular expressions, enabling higher quality text-to-speech synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a taxonomy of non-standard words in Lithuanian texts, creates regular expression rules to identify and expand them, performs experiments on three diverse datasets, analyzes the error rates and causes, and makes recommendations for improving the text normalization process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several contributions to the task of text normalization for Lithuanian:

1. It presents a taxonomy of non-standard words (NSWs) adapted for the Lithuanian language, categorizing them into classes like letters, numbers, and others. 

2. It develops rules based on regular expressions for identifying and expanding NSWs in Lithuanian text. Rules are created for various classes like cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, dates, times, phone numbers, codes, URLs, etc.

3. It performs experiments on three diverse Lithuanian datasets - news articles, university website text, and car navigation text. Rules are tested by splitting data in half, using one half for rule development and other half for testing. Error analysis is provided.

4. It makes recommendations for expanding abbreviations in Lithuanian - only expand units of measure after numbers, while for other abbreviations, either read them as words or spell them out instead of attempting full expansion. This avoids incorrect determination of grammatical forms.

In summary, the key contribution is a systematic study of Lithuanian text normalization using regular expressions, along with a set of rules, experiments on real datasets, error analysis, and recommendations.

The paper examines text normalization for Lithuanian text-to-speech synthesis using regular expressions. It presents a taxonomy of semiotic classes adapted for the Lithuanian language and develops rules based on regular expressions to identify and expand non-standard words belonging to those classes. Experiments are conducted on three diverse Lithuanian datasets - news articles, university website content, and car navigation texts. Errors are analyzed to provide recommendations for improving the text normalization rules. So the key concepts revolve around text normalization, specifically for Lithuanian text-to-speech, using regular expressions and semiotic taxonomy.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the text normalization method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper mentions that regular expressions have limitations in terms of recursion and validation of identified elements. Can you elaborate on these limitations? How could the proposed method be improved to address these limitations?

2) The rules for expanding non-standard words are grouped by semiotic class. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? Could an alternative organization of the rules have been more effective?

3) The paper uses special tags like «PG» to mark grammatical features of words during the expansion process. What role do these tags play? Could the expansions have been done accurately without using these tags?

4) What were some of the major challenges in writing regular expressions to handle inflected forms in a highly inflective language like Lithuanian? How well does the current set of rules address these challenges? 

5) The error analysis highlights various examples where the correct grammatical form could not be determined from the context. What enhancements could be made to the proposed method to address this issue more effectively?

6) The expansion of abbreviations is identified as a major source of errors. Why is expanding abbreviations so challenging? What alternative approaches could reduce errors in this area?

7) How suitable is the proposed regular expression based method for expanding non-standard words in languages other than Lithuanian? What modifications would be needed to adapt it to other languages?

8) The paper recommends not expanding certain abbreviations to avoid errors in determining grammatical forms. When would expanding abbreviations be preferable to leaving them as-is? What criteria should guide this decision?

9) What mechanisms does the paper propose to handle overlapping or interconnected non-standard words in the text? How effective are these mechanisms?

10) The error analysis is done by manually inspecting and counting incorrect expansions. What other evaluation approaches could have helped better analyze the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method?
