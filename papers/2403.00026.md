# [Learning to Deliver: a Foundation Model for the Montreal Capacitated   Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00026)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem with many real-world applications in transportation and logistics. This paper focuses on a variant called the Montreal CVRP (MCVRP) which models real-world delivery problems more closely. In the MCVRP, there is a fixed graph of potential customer locations, but each instance only has demands at a subset of nodes. Prior machine learning approaches to the CVRP have limitations in terms of solution quality, model unification across problem sizes and vehicle capacities, and generalization beyond seen instance sizes.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes the Foundation Model for the MCVRP (FM-MCVRP), a novel deep learning model based on recent advances in large language models. It models the MCVRP routing task analogously to a language modeling task. Specifically, it uses a Transformer architecture in an auto-regressive encoder-decoder setup to predict node visitation sequences on the graph. The model is trained in a supervised manner on 38.1 million suboptimal solution trajectories obtained from a construction heuristic. 

Main Contributions:
1) First application of large language model methods to vehicle routing, demonstrating the potential to match or outperform traditional OR methods.

2) A unified model that handles varying instance sizes and vehicle capacities, unlike prior neural approaches that need one model per parameter setting.

3) Outperforms the suboptimal solutions it was trained on. Competitive with state-of-the-art heuristics despite inferior training data.

4) Generalizes to larger unseen instance sizes at test time while maintaining solution quality.

The model and analyses have meaningful implications for leveraging machine learning on vehicle routing in real-world logistics operations. Potential directions include incorporating complex real-world objectives beyond distance, and bootstrapping model solutions to improve itself.
