# [Comparison of Microservice Call Rate Predictions for Replication in the   Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03319)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Microservice-based applications deployed on cloud clusters experience variable call rates and processing times due to dynamic user requests. This leads to scalability and bottleneck issues.  
- Existing auto-scaling methods for microservices focus on resource metrics without predicting changes in user request rates.

Proposed Solution:
- Use machine learning (ML) models to predict microservice call rates based on processing times, in order to estimate required scaling.
- Apply and compare linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and gradient boosting regression (GBR) models. 
- Models are trained on traces from a real-world Alibaba Cloud cluster containing microservice execution times and call rates.

Key Contributions:
- Comparative evaluation of different ML models for microservice call rate prediction, to address auto-scaling requirements.
- LR model has lowest training time but higher error. GBR balances errors and training time better than LR and MLP.  
- GBR model reduces mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to other models.
- Replication prediction using GBR is closes to actual test data without prediction.
- Architecture design integrating prediction models into an auto-scaling and scheduling pipeline.

In summary, this paper explores using ML for microservice call rate prediction to address auto-scaling requirements arising from variable user loads. Key findings are that gradient boosting regression balances errors and training time effectively. The models are integrated into a pipeline for scheduling and deploying replications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares linear regression, multilayer perceptron, and gradient boosting regression machine learning models to predict microservice call rates and required replicas based on microservice execution times using Alibaba Cloud trace data, finding that gradient boosting provides a balance between prediction accuracy and training time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

A comparative evaluation of machine learning (ML) models, including linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and gradient boosting regression (GBR), for predicting microservice call rates in cloud computing environments. The prediction results are then used to estimate the required number of replicas to horizontally scale each microservice to support dynamic changes in user requests. 

The key findings are:

- The GBR model achieves a balance between lower prediction errors (mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error) and training time compared to the LR and MLP models. 

- The number of replicas estimated by the GBR model for each microservice is close to the actual test data without any prediction.

- The GBR model reduces the prediction errors for the number of replicas compared to the LR and MLP models.

In summary, the GBR model provides reasonably accurate microservice call rate predictions to determine auto-scaling requirements, with better overall performance than other compared ML methods.
