# [FasterViT: Fast Vision Transformers with Hierarchical Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06189)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we design an efficient Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and throughput (images per second) for computer vision tasks?

Specifically, the paper proposes a new hybrid CNN-Transformer model called FasterViT that is tailored for high image throughput while maintaining high accuracy. The key ideas are:

- Using a multi-scale architecture with convolutional layers in early stages for fast feature extraction, and transformer layers in later stages for modeling global dependencies. 

- Introducing a novel Hierarchical Attention (HAT) module that reduces the complexity of standard self-attention while still allowing global context propagation.

- Carefully designing components like normalization, convolutions, attention to maximize throughput on GPU hardware.

The paper shows FasterViT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-offs on ImageNet classification, outperforming prior hybrid and transformer models. It also demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation.

In summary, the main research question is how to design an efficient ViT backbone optimized for computer vision tasks, which they address through a novel architecture with hierarchical attention. The key contribution is achieving much higher throughput than prior ViTs while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new hybrid CNN-ViT architecture called FasterViT that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and throughput (images processed per second) for computer vision tasks. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Introducing the FasterViT architecture that combines CNN and transformer blocks, with HAT modules in later stages. It is designed to maximize throughput by using dense convolutions in early stages and efficient HAT transformers in later stages.

- Achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and throughput trade-offs on ImageNet classification. FasterViT models outperform previous CNN and ViT models in terms of throughput for the same accuracy.

- Demonstrating strong performance of FasterViT backbones on downstream tasks like object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

- Showing that FasterViT scales well to larger datasets and input image sizes. It outperforms models like Swin Transformer V2 when pre-trained on ImageNet-21K and fine-tuned on high resolution images.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other research in efficient vision transformers:

- The paper focuses on improving the accuracy-throughput tradeoff for vision transformers, which is an active area of research. Other papers like Swin Transformer, Twins, CSwin, etc. have similar goals of designing architectures to be faster and more efficient. 

- The main novelty in this paper is the proposed Hierarchical Attention (HAT) module. HAT aims to capture both local and global information in an efficient manner compared to standard self-attention. Other papers have proposed different attention mechanisms like window attention in Swin, but HAT specifically uses carrier tokens to enable cross-window communication.

- For the overall architecture, the paper uses a hybrid CNN and transformer design, with CNN layers in early stages and transformer blocks later. This follows a similar philosophy as other hybrid models like LeViT, CrossViT, CoaT, etc. that try to get benefits of both CNNs and transformers.

- The paper shows strong empirical results, achieving state-of-the-art in the accuracy vs throughput tradeoff on ImageNet. The comparisons are done comprehensively against ConvNets, transformer models, and other hybrids.

- For downstream tasks, the paper evaluates on COCO detection/segmentation and ADE20K segmentation. Other papers also evaluate on these common vision tasks to demonstrate generalization.

- One unique aspect is analysis of higher resolution training and fine-tuning. The paper argues FasterViT is advantageous for high-resolution inputs. In contrast, other models are mostly benchmarked on 224x224 ImageNet.

Overall the paper builds nicely on top of recent work on efficient vision transformers, and proposes a novel architecture with hierarchical attention to push state-of-the-art further. The comparisons and experiments follow conventions in literature to benchmark against related models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing improved self-attention mechanisms for ViTs that can capture both local and global information while maintaining efficiency and scalability. The authors propose a hierarchical attention approach in this work, but suggest there is room for further enhancements and alternatives. 

- Exploring different hybrid CNN-ViT architectures to get the best of both worlds - the inductive bias and efficiency of CNNs combined with the strong representation learning of ViTs. The authors propose one such hybrid in this work, but many other combinations could be tried.

- Scaling up ViTs to even larger datasets and higher resolutions while maintaining efficiency. The authors show promising results scaling up to ImageNet-21K, but suggest going further, particularly with high-resolution images.

- Applying the ideas to other domains beyond computer vision, such as NLP. The hierarchical attention mechanism may be useful in other sequence modeling tasks.

- Combining architectural innovations with other efficiency methods like model compression, dynamic inference, etc. There are orthogonal ways to improve efficiency that could complement the architectural work.

- Deploying models like FasterViT on edge devices and quantifying performance in practice. The throughput results are promising, but need real-world validation.

So in summary, the main directions are developing improved attention mechanisms, exploring CNN-ViT combinations, scaling to larger datasets and resolutions, applying to other domains, combining approaches, and deployment to edge devices. The authors have introduced promising ideas but suggest lots of room for future work building on them.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new hybrid CNN-ViT model called FasterViT for computer vision tasks that achieves high throughput while maintaining accuracy. FasterViT combines convolutional blocks that learn local representations with transformer blocks that learn global representations. A key contribution is a new Hierarchical Attention (HAT) module that reduces the complexity of standard ViT self-attention. HAT uses local window attention as a first step. It then selects a small number of "carrier tokens" to summarize each local window. These carrier tokens interact via a second self-attention step to propagate information globally. This hierarchical design captures both local and global context efficiently. Experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO detection/segmentation, and ADE20K segmentation show FasterViT achieves excellent throughput vs accuracy tradeoffs compared to ConvNets, ViTs, and other hybrids. The hierarchical attention mechanism also improves throughput and accuracy when added to existing models like Swin-T. Overall, FasterViT advances the state-of-the-art on the accuracy-latency Pareto front for computer vision models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new family of hybrid CNN-ViT neural networks called FasterViT for high image throughput in computer vision applications. FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling of ViTs. A new Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach is introduced that decomposes the quadratic complexity of global self-attention into multi-level attention with reduced costs. Efficient window-based self-attention is used where each window has dedicated carrier tokens that enable local and global representation learning. The global self-attentions facilitate efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. 

FasterViT achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front on accuracy versus image throughput trade-off. It is validated on image classification, object detection and segmentation tasks. HAT can also be used as a plug-and-play module to enhance existing networks. Significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive models is demonstrated for high resolution images. The key innovations are the multi-scale CNN-ViT architecture tailored for high throughput, and the proposed Hierarchical Attention that reduces self-attention complexity while enabling global context modeling.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be introducing a new vision transformer architecture called FasterViT for computer vision tasks. The key issues and questions it is trying to address are:

- Vision Transformers (ViTs) have high computational complexity, especially for high-resolution images, due to their self-attention mechanism. This limits their throughput (images per second) compared to CNNs. 

- Local window-based self-attention in models like Swin Transformer improves efficiency but limits global contextual modeling which hurts accuracy.

- How to improve the tradeoff between accuracy and throughput compared to existing CNN, ViT, and hybrid models?

- How to enable efficient global contextual modeling for high-resolution images in ViTs?

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new hybrid CNN-Transformer model called FasterViT with the following key ideas:

- Uses a hierarchical design with convolutional layers at high resolutions and transformer layers at lower resolutions to improve efficiency.

- Introduces a novel Hierarchical Attention (HAT) module to enable global contextual modeling across windows efficiently. 

- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput tradeoffs on ImageNet classification.

- Scales effectively to high-resolution images and larger datasets.

- Can be used as a drop-in module to improve existing models.

In summary, the paper aims to push the accuracy-efficiency Pareto front for vision transformers by co-designing a hybrid architecture and attention mechanism that balances local and global modeling for computer vision tasks.
