# [Manipulating the Label Space for In-Context Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00351)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summarization paragraph for the paper:

This paper proposes two novel methods, Label Distribution Enhancement (LDE) and Visual Description Enhancement (VDE), to manipulate the label space and enhance in-context classification performance for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like Flamingo. LDE computes label distributions based on multi-modal similarities, providing richer semantic information and mitigating the impact of misleading labels. VDE leverages the cross-modal capabilities of VLMs to generate detailed visual feature descriptions for each label, allowing for clearer differentiation between classes with subtle distinctions. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet and three fine-grained classification datasets, various LDE and VDE strategies are shown to significantly outperform the baseline single-label approach, with an ensemble strategy combining LDE and VDE delivering optimal accuracy gains. A key advantage demonstrated is the efficacy of these methods in minimal data regimes of 1-2 shots while requiring no additional model training or fine-tuning, underscoring their efficiency and generalizability. The methods help bridge the performance gap in classification between generative language models like Flamingo and contrastive approaches like CLIP. Detailed analysis reveals LDE to provide a holistic data-efficient view via label distributions, while VDE taps into visual nuances using VLM reasoning, with their combination surpassing individual strategies.
