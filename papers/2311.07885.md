# [One-2-3-45++: Fast Single Image to 3D Objects with Consistent Multi-View   Generation and 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07885)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents One-2-3-45++, an innovative method that transforms a single image into a detailed 3D textured mesh in about one minute by leveraging 2D diffusion models and 3D priors.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called One-2-3-45++ for generating a 3D textured mesh from a single input image. The approach first uses a finetuned 2D diffusion model to generate consistent multi-view images of the object in the input image. These multi-view images then serve as conditions for a 3D diffusion model which reconstructs a textured 3D mesh in a coarse-to-fine manner. The mesh geometry and texture are further refined using the generated multi-view images as supervision. Compared to prior work, One-2-3-45++ is able to produce higher quality 3D meshes with textures that closely match the input image, in a fast feed-forward manner requiring only around 1 minute. Evaluations demonstrate the method's improvements over optimization-based and other feed-forward approaches in terms of visual quality, robustness, and fidelity to the input.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces One-2-3-45++, an innovative method for transforming a single image into a detailed 3D textured mesh within about one minute. The approach leverages the knowledge embedded in 2D diffusion models and the available yet limited 3D training data. It first finetunes a 2D diffusion model to generate a consistent set of multi-view images from the input image. These multi-view images then serve as conditions for a 3D diffusion model, which is trained on extensive 3D data, to reconstruct the 3D shape in a coarse-to-fine manner. The consistent multi-view images provide essential guidance during 3D generation. Finally, a lightweight optimization further refines the texture quality using the multi-view images as supervision. Experiments demonstrate One-2-3-45++'s ability to produce high-fidelity 3D assets mirroring the input image across a diverse test set. It significantly outperforms other methods in terms of visual quality, robustness, and input fidelity while retaining efficient runtimes. The work showcases the promise of effectively harnessing 2D and 3D models for rapid open-world 3D generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces One-2-3-45++, a novel method that transforms a single image into a 3D textured mesh in under a minute by leveraging 2D diffusion model priors to generate consistent multi-view images which are then elevated to 3D using a multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion model.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis seems to be: 

How can we effectively leverage the knowledge from powerful 2D generative models and the available 3D datasets to rapidly transform a single image into a high-quality, detailed 3D textured mesh that closely mirrors the input image?

The key points are:

- Leveraging rich priors from 2D generative models like diffusion models to aid 3D generation, given their impressive capabilities but the limited availability of 3D training data.

- Developing a method that can generate detailed 3D meshes from a single image in a fast feed-forward manner, unlike previous approaches that require slow per-shape optimization. 

- Ensuring the generated 3D mesh closely reflects the original input image, rather than just matching a text prompt.

- Combining the strengths of 2D and 3D models/data to compensate for their limitations - using 2D diffusion models to imagine views, while 3D diffusion models focus on shape and texture.

So in summary, the central research question seems to be how to effectively utilize 2D and 3D models together for fast, controllable, single image to 3D generation that produces high fidelity results.
