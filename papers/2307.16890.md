# [Discovering Adaptable Symbolic Algorithms from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16890)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we automatically discover robotic control policies that can adapt to sudden changes in the environment, without requiring manual engineering or a predefined structure?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By representing policies as programs instead of neural networks, and using evolutionary search to optimize both the program structure and numerical parameters from scratch, it is possible to evolve policies that can adapt their behavior on the fly to maintain performance when the environment changes dramatically.

The authors propose a new method called AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ) to address this question. The main ideas are:

- Use genetic programming to evolve programs, giving more flexibility than neural networks.

- Make the programs stateful, with persistent memory across timesteps, to support adaptation.

- Allow programs to conditionally invoke modular subprograms, enabling hierarchical behaviors. 

- Evolve programs completely from scratch, starting with minimal complexity.

- Test ARZ on a simulated quadruped robot task where legs randomly fail, requiring rapid adaptation.

The core hypothesis is that this approach will discover interpretable yet highly adaptive policies, outperforming neural network baselines like MLPs and LSTMs. The quadruped experiments and a new "Cataclysmic Cartpole" benchmark aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a new framework to evolve adaptable and interpretable robotic control policies represented as programs rather than neural networks. This is an extension of AutoML-Zero.

- Demonstrating ARZ on a realistic quadruped robot simulation, where it evolves policies that can maintain locomotion even when a leg suddenly breaks. ARZ outperforms MLP and LSTM baselines on this challenging task.

- Introducing a new non-stationary control benchmark called Cataclysmic Cartpole and using it to further analyze ARZ. The results confirm ARZ can build simple and interpretable policies that adapt better than an LSTM baseline, especially in tasks with sudden changes.

- Providing detailed analysis and visualizations to explain how the evolved ARZ policies work, highlighting their interpretability compared to neural network baselines. 

- Showing ARZ policies use significantly fewer parameters and operations than MLP/LSTM baselines.

- Demonstrating the utility of conditional automatically defined functions (CADFs) to improve policy expressiveness and performance in the quadruped task.

So in summary, the main contributions are introducing the ARZ framework, demonstrating its advantages on complex robotics tasks compared to neural network baselines, analyzing the interpretable policies it produces, and highlighting techniques like CADFs that improve its performance. The overarching theme is evolving adaptable and interpretable robotic control policies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes AutoRobotics-Zero, a new evolutionary method to discover adaptable and interpretable symbolic control policies for robots that can dynamically alter their behavior to maintain performance when faced with sudden environmental changes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ) compares to other research in evolving adaptable robotic control policies:

- Representation: Rather than neural networks, ARZ represents policies as symbolic programs with mutable parameters and logic. This provides more flexibility for on-the-fly adaptation compared to just tuning neural network weights.

- Task complexity: ARZ is demonstrated on a high-fidelity quadruped robot simulator, a more realistic and challenging task compared to simpler benchmark environments commonly used to study policy evolution.

- Interpretability: The symbolic program representation enables detailed analysis of how the policies adapt, in contrast to the black box nature of neural networks. 

- Multi-objective search: ARZ leverages NSGA-II to explicitly balance competing objectives like speed vs stability during evolution. This encourages specialization and diversity.

- Modularity: ARZ introduces conditionally-invoked functions (CADFs) that enable evolved programs to dynamically switch modular code fragments in/out during execution. This helps handle diverse tasks.  

- Zero-shot generalization: For the quadruped task, ARZ discovers policies that can adapt to any leg breaking instantly without needing to experience that specific failure mode during training.

- Sample efficiency: ARZ required fewer samples/simulations to find successful policies compared to Neural Network + RL baselines in the leg-breaking task.

Overall, ARZ pushes the boundary on evolving complex, interpretable yet adaptive policies for realistic robot control problems. The modular program representation and focus on zero-shot transfer are notable innovations compared to prior evolutionary robotics work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further study of modular/hierarchical policies and their impact on overcoming the distraction dilemma in multitask learning. The authors found that using conditionally invoked automatically defined functions (CADFs) in the search space for the quadruped robot task improved the ability to learn adaptable policies. They suggest more research could be done to understand the role of modularity and hierarchy in avoiding trade-offs when learning policies robust to diverse environmental physics.

- Additional analysis and development of the Cataclysmic Cartpole benchmark environment as a useful testbed for studying adaptation and lifelong learning in control policies. The authors propose it as a simple yet challenging domain for further research.

- Investigation into methods for adapting to completely unseen/unanticipated types of environmental change without any prior simulator. The authors had some preliminary results suggesting evolution with partial observability and dynamic noise during training may allow policies to generalize to novel dynamics at test time. They recommend further study on the robustness of this finding.

- Deeper analysis and interpretation of the evolved control programs, which the authors describe as uniquely simple and interpretable compared to neural network policies. Better understanding the mechanisms by which the evolved programs are able to adapt could provide insights into designing more effective adaptive policies.

In general, the authors highlight genetic programming and multi-objective search as promising approaches for automatically discovering interpretable yet adaptive robot control policies. They suggest further work on challenging benchmark tasks, as well as analysis of the evolved programs, as interesting directions for better understanding adaptation in policies and overcoming limitations of neural network representations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a new framework based on AutoML-Zero to evolve adaptable robotic control policies represented as programs rather than neural networks. It applies ARZ to evolve policies for a simulated quadruped robot and a novel non-stationary cartpole task. On both tasks, ARZ is able to discover simple and interpretable policies that can rapidly alter their behavior in response to sudden changes in the environment, outperforming MLP and LSTM baselines. The policies adapt by tuning parameters and modifying their own inference logic/structure. Unlike blackbox neural networks, the symbolic nature of the evolved programs allows detailed analysis to explain how they work. Overall, the results demonstrate that evolving programs with full expressiveness of a register machine enables discovering zero-shot adaptable policies from scratch.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ) to evolve adaptable control policies for robots. ARZ is based on AutoML-Zero and represents policies as programs rather than neural networks. It uses an evolutionary algorithm to discover programs that can tune their parameters and modify their own code on-the-fly to adapt to changes in the environment. The method is demonstrated on a simulated quadruped robot task, where ARZ evolves programs that can maintain locomotion when a leg unexpectedly breaks mid-episode. This is a challenging task where MLP and LSTM baselines fail. The evolved programs use significantly fewer parameters and operations than the MLP and LSTM models. The paper also introduces a new non-stationary control benchmark called Cataclysmic Cartpole and repeats the analysis, again finding ARZ outperforms an LSTM baseline. In both tasks, the ARZ policies are simple, interpretable programs that achieve superior adaptation compared to neural network baselines.

In summary, this paper develops a method to automatically discover symbolic, adaptable robot control policies that can cope with sudden environmental changes. Evolved programs surpass neural network baselines in challenging simulated robotics tasks while using fewer parameters and being more interpretable. The method is demonstrated in a realistic quadruped domain and a new non-stationary control benchmark environment.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a new framework based on AutoML-Zero to evolve adaptable robotic control policies represented as programs rather than neural networks. Policies are initialized with random code and constants and then optimized through an evolutionary algorithm that evaluates performance on a robotic control task. The evolutionary search can discover programs that tune their parameters or alter their own code at runtime to adapt to changes in the environment. Key aspects of ARZ include representing policies as conditional linear register machines with memory, using multi-objective search to balance competing objectives, and leveraging modular code blocks that can be conditionally swapped in/out at runtime. The method is demonstrated on a simulated quadruped robot task, in which ARZ evolves programs that can maintain locomotion when a random leg breaks, outperforming MLP and LSTM baselines. It is also analyzed on a new non-stationary control benchmark called Cataclysmic Cartpole.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper addresses the problem of developing robotic control policies that can rapidly adapt to changes in the environment. The key questions it seems to be exploring are:

- How can we automatically discover adaptive control policies for robots instead of manually designing them?

- Can these policies be represented as simple, interpretable programs rather than opaque neural networks? 

- Can the policies alter both their parameters and their control logic on-the-fly to handle sudden changes in the environment?

To tackle these questions, the paper proposes a new method called AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ) based on the prior work AutoML-Zero. The key ideas are:

- Represent policies as programs with conditional logic and modularity instead of monolithic neural nets. This improves interpretability.

- Use evolutionary search to automatically discover the structure and parameters of programs. This removes the need for manual design.

- Allow programs to tune their parameters and change which parts of their code execute in response to environmental changes. This enables adaptation.

The method is demonstrated on a simulated quadruped robot task, where ARZ evolves programs that can maintain locomotion when a leg suddenly breaks. It outperforms MLP and LSTM baselines. The evolved programs are shown to be simple, interpretable, and capable of instantly altering their behavior in response to failure events.

To further analyze ARZ, a new "Cataclysmic Cartpole" environment is proposed which has more gradual physics changes over time. Again, evolved programs outperform baseline neural networks, especially when changes are sudden and dramatic. The programs are analyzed to uncover how they accumulate state and adapt.

In summary, the key contributions seem to be: (1) a new method to automatically discover simple yet adaptive robot control policies, (2) demonstrations on a complex quadruped task and a new analysis environment, and (3) insights into how the evolved programs achieve adaptation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ) as a new framework based on AutoML-Zero (AMLZ) to evolve adaptable robotic policies represented as programs instead of neural networks. How does representing policies as programs rather than neural networks impact the discovered behaviors and adaptability? What are the trade-offs?

2. The paper demonstrates ARZ on a quadruped robot task where the goal is to maintain locomotion when a leg suddenly becomes passive. How crucial is the inclusion of Conditionally-invoked Automatically Defined Functions (CADFs) for discovering policies robust to leg breaking? Could a similar result be achieved without CADFs?

3. The paper finds ARZ policies use far fewer parameters and FLOPs than MLP/LSTM baselines in both the quadruped and Cataclysmic Cartpole tasks. To what extent does this efficiency stem from the incremental growth of programs via mutation/crossover versus regularization effects that prune unnecessary complexity?

4. For the Cataclysmic Cartpole task, policies are evolved without any knowledge of the non-stationary dynamics that will be tested later. How does injecting noise and partial observability allow the emergence of broadly adaptable policies? Can this approach generalize to other control domains?

5. The evolved policies for Cataclysmic Cartpole are interpreted as linear recurrent networks or PID controllers. Do these interpretations provide real insight into the policy behavior, or are they just convenient mathematical reformulations? What else could we learn by further analyzing the discovered programs?

6. Could the proposed approach be applied to real-world robotic platforms, or are the simulated environments used here too simplistic? What challenges would need to be overcome to deploy ARZ on physical robots?

7. The paper uses a basic set of mathematical operations as building blocks for control programs. How sensitive are the results to the particular ops included in the search space? What impact would adding more advanced operations have?

8. For the quadruped task, what enabled ARZ to succeed where MLP and LSTM baselines failed? Does the blackbox nature of neural networks fundamentally limit their adaptability compared to symbolic programs?

9. The paper suggests ARZ could be used to overcome the "distraction dilemma" in multitask learning. How exactly would evolving modular/hierarchical programs help avoid negative transfer between distinct tasks? 

10. The Cataclysmic Cartpole environment is proposed as a new benchmark for adaptable control. How suitable is this task for evaluating different lifelong/continual learning algorithms? What other metrics beyond raw episode return should be tracked?
