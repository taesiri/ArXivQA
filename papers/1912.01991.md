# [Self-Supervised Learning of Pretext-Invariant Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01991)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:Can learning image representations that are invariant to image transformations used in self-supervised pretext tasks improve the semantic quality of the representations?The authors propose an approach called Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL) to learn invariant representations for self-supervised learning. Their main hypothesis seems to be that invariance to image transformations will allow the representations to focus more on modeling semantic information rather than properties of the transformation, thereby improving the usefulness of the representations for downstream tasks like image classification and object detection.Specifically, the paper introduces PIRL as an alternative to existing self-supervised approaches like solving jigsaw puzzles that learn representations covarying with the transformations. PIRL instead encourages similarity between representations of an image and its transformed version using a contrastive loss. The central hypothesis is that this invariance objective will yield representations with better semantics and performance on transfer learning benchmarks. The experiments aim to test if PIRL representations are indeed more invariant and achieve superior transfer performance compared to prior self-supervised approaches, validating their hypothesis.In summary, the key research question addressed is whether enforcing invariance to pretext image transformations can improve representation learning for self-supervised approaches. PIRL is proposed as a way to achieve this invariance and the results are analyzed to determine if it indeed learns improved semantic representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL). Specifically:- PIRL aims to learn image representations that are invariant to transformations used in self-supervised pretext tasks, rather than being covariant with the transformations. The authors argue that semantic representations should be invariant rather than covariant.- PIRL adapts the commonly used "jigsaw puzzle" pretext task to learn invariant representations rather than solve the actual pretext task. - Experiments show PIRL substantially improves the semantic quality of the learned image representations compared to the standard covariant approach on several benchmarks.- PIRL sets a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised learning on ImageNet classification and transfer learning benchmarks. - Notably, PIRL even outperforms supervised pre-training for object detection, demonstrating the potential of self-supervised learning to learn useful semantic representations from images alone.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the PIRL approach for learning invariant representations with self-supervision, and demonstrating its effectiveness versus prior self-supervised and supervised methods. The results highlight the promise of self-supervised learning, especially using pretext tasks designed to learn invariant features.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in self-supervised representation learning:- The main contribution is presenting PIRL, an approach to learn image representations that are invariant to image transformations used in pretext tasks. This is in contrast to many prior self-supervised methods that learn representations covariant to the transformations. The authors argue invariant representations are more useful for downstream tasks.- PIRL is evaluated primarily in the context of the jigsaw puzzle pretext task, building on prior work like Noroozi et al. 2016. However, the invariance idea could be applied to other pretext tasks as well. The authors show some results combining jigsaw and rotation tasks.- The paper shows PIRL substantially outperforms the standard jigsaw pretext task and other prior self-supervised methods like rotations and NPID on ImageNet transfer learning benchmarks. The gains suggest the benefits of the invariance approach.- PIRL achieves new state-of-the-art results among self-supervised methods on several image classification datasets when using linear evaluation. It also exceeds supervised pre-training on PASCAL VOC object detection when fine-tuning the full network.- The results are very competitive with other concurrent self-supervised methods published around the same time like MoCo and CMC. PIRL's advantage is achieving strong performance with a conceptually simple framework and training approach.- The analysis provides insights about the invariance properties of PIRL, the effect of different loss formulations, and benefits of combining pretext tasks. This sheds light on why PIRL works well.In summary, the paper makes a useful contribution in presenting and analyzing the concept of learning invariant representations with pretext tasks, and showing its effectiveness on multiple standard vision benchmarks. The results rank among the top self-supervised methods, demonstrating the promise of the invariance approach.
