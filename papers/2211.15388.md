# [Shifted Diffusion for Text-to-image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve text-to-image generation by designing a better diffusion process that incorporates prior knowledge from pre-trained models like CLIP?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The vanilla diffusion process used in prior work like DALL-E 2 may not be ideal for generating high-quality CLIP image embeddings, since the noise distribution is far from the true distribution of embeddings. 

2) By designing the diffusion to start from an distribution estimated from real embeddings and shift towards that distribution during sampling, it can better approximate the target embedding.

3) This "shifted diffusion" can lead to improved text-to-image generation, especially when combined with using multiple adjustable Gaussians to capture multimodal aspects of the true embedding distribution.

4) The proposed framework also enables beneficial applications like semi-supervised and language-free training of text-to-image models.

So in summary, the central focus seems to be improving text-to-image generation through a novel shifted diffusion technique that incorporates insights about the CLIP latent space, with flexible training as an additional benefit. The paper aims to validate these hypotheses through quantitative metrics and human evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes Corgi, a novel diffusion model for text-to-image generation. Corgi incorporates prior knowledge from pre-trained models like CLIP into the diffusion process through a new initialization distribution and transition step. 

2. It enables semi-supervised and language-free training for text-to-image generation. With only 1.7% captioned images, Corgi achieves results comparable to SOTA models on MS-COCO. It also achieves new SOTA on language-free text-to-image generation.

3. Extensive experiments are conducted on large datasets. Both quantitative metrics and human evaluation show Corgi's superior text-to-image generation ability compared to strong baselines like DALL-E 2. 

4. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed shifted diffusion over standard diffusion for text-to-image generation. Experiments also analyze different design choices for the initialization distribution.

In summary, the key contribution is a new diffusion model that better utilizes pre-trained models like CLIP, enables semi-supervised and language-free training, and achieves improved text-to-image generation ability. The effectiveness is shown through comprehensive experiments and comparisons.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Corgi, a novel diffusion model for text-to-image generation that incorporates knowledge from pre-trained CLIP models into the diffusion process, enabling flexible applications like semi-supervised and language-free training while achieving improved performance over strong baselines.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of text-to-image generation:

- The key novelty of this paper is the proposed "shifted diffusion" model, which incorporates prior knowledge from pre-trained models like CLIP into the diffusion process for better text-to-image generation. This differs from previous works like DALL-E 2 and Imagen which mainly focused on scaling up modules or architectures. 

- By incorporating CLIP embeddings, the proposed model enables flexible applications like semi-supervised and language-free training. This capability to train with limited labeled data is an important contribution compared to fully supervised models like DALL-E 2.

- The proposed model obtains strong quantitative results on popular benchmarks like MS-COCO and human evaluation metrics. The results are competitive or better than recent models like DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Parti.

- For language-free training, the method outperforms prior works Lafite and Lafite-2 across different datasets. It also shows promising fine-tuning results when combined with models like Stable Diffusion.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights into the benefits of shifted diffusion over baseline diffusion, especially in terms of sample quality and embedding similarity. This helps validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- The flexible framework allows integration with different decoders like diffusion models or GANs. This modularity could make the approach easily adaptable to other generative models.

Overall, the shifted diffusion technique seems like a valuable contribution over prior art by enabling flexible training and improving sample quality. The competitive quantitative and qualitative results validate its usefulness for text-to-image generation. The comparisons on benchmarks and ablation studies help situate its capabilities relative to other recent models in this space.
