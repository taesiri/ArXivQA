# [Shifted Diffusion for Text-to-image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve text-to-image generation by designing a better diffusion process that incorporates prior knowledge from pre-trained models like CLIP?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The vanilla diffusion process used in prior work like DALL-E 2 may not be ideal for generating high-quality CLIP image embeddings, since the noise distribution is far from the true distribution of embeddings. 

2) By designing the diffusion to start from an distribution estimated from real embeddings and shift towards that distribution during sampling, it can better approximate the target embedding.

3) This "shifted diffusion" can lead to improved text-to-image generation, especially when combined with using multiple adjustable Gaussians to capture multimodal aspects of the true embedding distribution.

4) The proposed framework also enables beneficial applications like semi-supervised and language-free training of text-to-image models.

So in summary, the central focus seems to be improving text-to-image generation through a novel shifted diffusion technique that incorporates insights about the CLIP latent space, with flexible training as an additional benefit. The paper aims to validate these hypotheses through quantitative metrics and human evaluation.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Corgi, a novel method for text-to-image generation based on a proposed shifted diffusion model. Corgi incorporates prior knowledge from pre-trained CLIP models into the diffusion process through a new initialization distribution and transition step. This allows Corgi to generate better image embeddings from text compared to baseline diffusion models like the one used in DALL-E 2. Corgi can be applied in different settings including supervised, semi-supervised, and language-free training. Extensive experiments show Corgi achieves state-of-the-art results across datasets in the language-free setting and results comparable to DALL-E 2 in the semi-supervised setting with only 1.7% captioned images. 

The key ideas behind Corgi are: 1) Motivated by the observation that valid CLIP embeddings occupy a small region, Corgi initializes the diffusion process closer to the target embedding distribution. 2) The diffusion transition step is designed to convert a real image embedding into a random one, unlike baseline models that diffuse real embeddings to Gaussian noise. 3) Corgi uses a collection of parametric Gaussians for initialization that are aligned with text embeddings. 4) The framework enables semi-supervised and language-free training which is important for new domains with limited budgets. Experiments validate the effectiveness of Corgi's shifted diffusion approach and demonstrate strong quantitative and qualitative results across settings.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel diffusion model called Corgi for text-to-image generation. Corgi incorporates prior knowledge from pre-trained CLIP models into the diffusion process by designing a new initialization distribution and transition step. Specifically, the initial distribution is modeled as a Gaussian mixture estimated from the training data to better match the distribution of valid CLIP embeddings. The transition step includes an additional shift term to move the sampling process closer to the target embedding at each step. Together, these modifications enable Corgi to generate higher quality CLIP embeddings from text compared to standard diffusion models. Corgi is applied to both conditional and unconditional image generation tasks, demonstrating improved performance over strong baselines. The framework also naturally enables semi-supervised learning, where only a fraction of training images are paired with captions. Experiments show Corgi achieves results comparable to fully supervised methods even when only 1.7% of images have captions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key questions and problems it is addressing are:

1. How to improve text-to-image generation by designing better diffusion models rather than just scaling up modules or architectures. 

2. How to incorporate prior knowledge from pre-trained models like CLIP into the diffusion process to get better image embeddings from text.

3. How to enable flexible text-to-image generation under different settings like supervised, semi-supervised, and language-free training.

4. How to bridge the gap in data availability and cost for researchers by enabling effective semi-supervised and language-free training with a fraction of labeled image-text pairs.

5. Whether it is possible to achieve competitive results with only a small percentage of images captioned in the training data compared to fully supervised methods.

6. How to achieve new state-of-the-art results on downstream language-free text-to-image generation compared to prior methods.

In summary, the key focus is on improving text-to-image generation itself through novel diffusion techniques, while also enabling flexibility across different training scenarios and reducing the annotation cost/burden via semi-supervised and language-free training. The proposed Corgi model aims to address these challenges.
