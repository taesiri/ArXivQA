# [Thinking Like an Annotator: Generation of Dataset Labeling Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14035)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate high-quality labeling instructions for existing datasets in order to increase transparency, reproducibility, and utility?The authors highlight that detailed labeling instructions are rarely released publicly with datasets, even though they are critical for understanding annotation policies and boundaries between classes. They propose a new task called Labeling Instruction Generation (LIG) to automatically generate labeling instructions for a dataset using only the images and labels. The main hypothesis seems to be that their proposed framework, Proxy Dataset Curator (PDC), can act as an effective proxy for human annotators and dataset curators in generating multi-modal labeling instructions composed of representative text and image pairs for each class. They aim to show through computational metrics and human evaluation that PDC can produce high-quality, visually-informative labeling instructions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a new task called Labeling Instruction Generation (LIG) to address the lack of publicly available labeling instructions for most datasets. The main contributions are:1. It highlights that labeling instructions are rarely made public for datasets, even though they are critical for understanding annotation policies and reproducibility. 2. It proposes the LIG task to automatically generate multi-modal labeling instructions (text descriptions + visual examples) for a dataset, acting as a proxy for human annotators and curators.3. It introduces a framework called Proxy Dataset Curator (PDC) to solve the LIG task efficiently without any model training. PDC retrieves representative text and image examples from the dataset itself to compose the instructions.4. It evaluates PDC on the NuImages and COCO datasets, showing it can generate high quality instructions that outperform baselines. Both computational evaluations and human experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PDC.5. The paper frames LIG as an important new problem, proposes a practical solution in PDC, and shows strong initial results. Enabling the creation of labeling instructions could significantly improve dataset transparency and reproducibility in computer vision.In summary, the main contribution is identifying the lack of labeling instructions as an overlooked problem, formalizing it as the LIG task, and providing an initial solution to automatically generate multi-modal instructions for a dataset without manual effort.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new task called Labeling Instruction Generation (LIG) to address the lack of publicly available annotation instructions for most datasets, and introduces a framework called Proxy Dataset Curator (PDC) that acts as a proxy for human annotators to generate multi-modal labeling instructions for a given dataset without requiring model training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces a new task called Labeling Instruction Generation (LIG) to address the lack of publicly available labeling instructions for most datasets. This is a novel contribution and an important area to explore given the increasing focus on dataset transparency and reproducibility. - The proposed method, Proxy Dataset Curator (PDC), is an efficient framework that acts as a proxy for human annotators in generating labeling instructions. Using only inference from a pre-trained vision-language model, it is more computationally efficient than methods requiring full model training.- Most prior work has focused on improving annotation quality through analyzing annotator interpretations or prompting for different types of labels. In contrast, this paper targets the core annotation instructions themselves. However, some limitations could be better incorporating negative examples and more expressive text generations.- The experiments demonstrate strong performance on the proposed LIG task, with PDC outperforming baselines by a large margin on metrics like mean average precision. The human study provides additional validation that the generated instructions are reasonable.- The overall framing situates the work nicely in the context of datasets and transparency. However, the introduced method itself is fairly straightforward conceptually. The core ideas likely could generalize well to other datasets, but more complex methods could push performance further.In summary, this paper makes a valuable contribution in identifying and formalizing an undertreated but important problem. The presented approach is simple and effective, yet limitations exist and much room remains for future work to build on the concepts introduced here. The results convincingly demonstrate the potential of automating labeling instruction generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing richer multi-modal instructions beyond just text and image pairs. The authors note that while they focus on text+image pairs, more complex multi-modal instructions could be an interesting avenue for future work.- Generating more nuanced and detailed text instructions. The authors acknowledge that the automatically generated text instructions may lack some of the nuance of human-written instructions, so advances in large language models to enable more expressive text generation would be beneficial. - Incorporating negative examples into the instruction sets. The authors point out that representing negatives is currently difficult in language and vision models, but progress in this area could enable negatives to be considered in future versions of the framework.- Exploring personalized instruction sets. The authors cite some recent work that learns personalized visual concepts from users, suggesting the potential to have frameworks like theirs generate tailored instruction sets for individual users/annotators.- Conducting full-scale human annotation studies. While expensive and time-consuming, human annotation tasks using the generated instructions would provide the gold standard evaluation.- Applying the approach to additional datasets and domains. The authors demonstrate their framework on COCO and NuImages, but suggest it could be used for other datasets lacking public instructions.- Investigating instruction generation for video datasets. The current method focuses on images, but video presents additional challenges that could be interesting to explore in future work.- Improving corner case coverage in the generated instructions. The authors indicate further improving the coverage of unusual/boundary cases could be an aim for enhancing the approach.In summary, the main future directions center on expanding the instruction modalities, scaling up evaluations, and applying the framework to new datasets and domains. Advances in language and vision models will also likely benefit the approach over time.
