## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel robotic system for harvesting table-top grown strawberries. The system features a minimal footprint end-effector tool (35mm width) that traps the fruit stem in a groove and cuts it using a focused laser beam. This enables robust operation tolerating Â±15mm localization error while not contacting or damaging the fruit. The harvesting tool is mounted on a 6 DOF robotic arm replicating a typical table-top strawberry growing setup with two RGB-D cameras for fruit detection. Experiments demonstrate successful autonomous harvesting with an average cycle time of 8 seconds at 50% max velocity, competitive with manual harvesting. Key innovations include the trapping mechanism for precise laser cutting despite imperfect sensing, as well as the first application of a maintenance-free laser cutting tool for fruit harvesting. This research provides a promising solution to automate the labor-intensive process of strawberry harvesting.
