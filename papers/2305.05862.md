# [Are ChatGPT and GPT-4 General-Purpose Solvers for Financial Text   Analytics? An Examination on Several Typical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05862)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: "How effective are ChatGPT and GPT-4 at solving financial text analytics tasks without further adaptation?"The authors aim to investigate the capabilities of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on typical tasks in the financial domain, such as sentiment analysis, arithmetic reasoning, text classification, and question answering. They evaluate the performance of these models on several financial datasets and compare them to fine-tuned domain-specific models. The goal is to understand if ChatGPT and GPT-4 can be effective for financial NLP tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot setting, without requiring further training or fine-tuning on financial data. In essence, the paper seeks to examine and profile the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on specialized tasks in the finance domain, providing insights into their applicability as general-purpose solvers for financial text analytics. The empirical study aims to highlight areas where improvements to these models may be needed to enhance performance on domain-specific tasks requiring specialized knowledge.
