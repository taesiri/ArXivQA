# [Data-driven Energy Efficiency Modelling in Large-scale Networks: An   Expert Knowledge and ML-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Optimizing network energy saving solutions like carrier shutdown in large-scale 4G/5G networks is very complex due to the large number of cells, stochastic traffic, intricate tradeoffs between energy savings and network/UE performance etc. 
- Existing optimization approaches have limitations - expert knowledge is manual and doesn't scale, drive tests and ray tracing tools are expensive, analytical models make simplifying assumptions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel data-driven framework called SRCON that uses a blend of machine learning (ML) and expert models to predict network energy efficiency and UE performance.
- It decomposes the large network modeling problem into ML-based models for BS energy consumption and UE data rates, and an expert-based agent-based model (ABM) that mimics network behavior and carrier shutdown.
- The ABM takes engineering parameters as input and outputs cell load, shutdown times etc. to drive the ML models. This allows generalization to any carrier shutdown configuration.

Key Contributions:
- Novel data-driven network energy efficiency modeling approach using mixed ML and expert models.
- Decomposes problem into ML-based BS energy and UE rate models, and expert-based ABM for generalization.
- Details ML model construction for diversity of BS products and UEs.
- Proposes innovative ABM that captures network stochasticity and carrier shutdown behavior.
- Provides data-driven results from real network showing significant gains over benchmark tool used by operators.
- Enables network optimization without expensive drive tests or ray tracing simulations.

In summary, the paper introduces a paradigm shift in practical cellular network modeling leveraging available data, with very good results on energy savings optimization. The reliability of this approach is a key asset for optimizing real-world networks.
