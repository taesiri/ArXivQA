## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "LeTac-MPC: Learning Model Predictive Control for Tactile-reactive Grasping":

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenges of robotic tactile-reactive grasping, which involves adjusting the gripper grasp in real-time based on tactile feedback to robustly grasp objects. Key challenges include:
1) Objects can have varying and complex physical properties, making tactile perception difficult.  
2) Grasping needs to be robust to dynamics and external forces during tasks like transportation or collisions.
3) Integrating high-resolution tactile sensors like GelSight into a real-time control loop is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LeTac-MPC, a learning-based model predictive control approach. The key ideas are:

1) A neural network encodes tactile images into an embedding vector, which is input into a differentiable MPC layer that models the dynamics and outputs optimal gripper motion.

2) The method is trained on a dataset collected using an automated pipeline with standardized blocks. Despite this, it generalizes to various daily objects.  

3) The trained model is implemented as a real-time convergent MPC controller by incorporating constraints and tuning weights. It runs at 25Hz.

Main Contributions:

1) A learning-based tactile MPC formulation using a differentiable MPC layer, enabling real-time convergent control by combining data-driven and model-based methods.

2) Automated data collection pipeline requiring only standardized blocks, yet demonstrates generalization to diverse unseen objects.

3) Experimental validation of grasping dynamic tasks compared to baseline methods, showing superior performance in adjusting gripper grasp reactively based on tactile feedback.

4) Releasing code, data and demonstrations grasping various objects using the proposed LeTac-MPC method.
