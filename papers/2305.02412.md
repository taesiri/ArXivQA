# [Plan, Eliminate, and Track -- Language Models are Good Teachers for   Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02412)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new framework called Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) for using large language models (LLMs) to assist embodied agents in completing tasks. 

- The goal is to leverage the knowledge and common sense captured in LLMs to help agents, rather than having the LLM directly serve as the agent policy. This is because LLMs have limitations like fixed input lengths that make them ill-suited to directly control agents.

- The PET framework has 3 components:
  - Plan module uses an LLM to generate high-level sub-tasks for an input task
  - Eliminate module uses a QA model to mask irrelevant objects/receptacles
  - Track module uses a QA model to track progress on sub-tasks

- Experiments on the AlfWorld benchmark show PET assists an Action Attention agent, achieving strong results, especially on human goal specifications where it outperforms prior work.

- Ablations and analysis indicate each PET module provides a useful capability for assisting the agent.

The central hypothesis seems to be that leveraging LLMs for knowledge and simplifying the task, rather than directly acting, will produce better task completion by embodied agents. The results support this claim, showing benefits from the PET framework versus prior methods.

The paper also suggests there is room for improvement in the PET approach, such as by handling cases where progress is undone or integrating LLM knowledge in different ways. So it does not position PET as the complete solution, but rather a promising direction for utilizing LLM knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the PET (Plan, Eliminate, Track) framework that leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to assist embodied agents in three key ways:

- The Plan module uses an LLM to generate high-level sub-tasks for a given complex task description. This simplifies the task by breaking it down into simpler steps.

- The Eliminate module uses a QA-based LLM to remove irrelevant objects/receptacles from observations, reducing noise. 

- The Track module uses a QA-based LLM to track progress on sub-tasks.

2. An Action Attention agent architecture that handles the variable action space in text environments like AlfWorld.

3. Demonstrating that the PET framework leads to significant improvements in generalization performance on the AlfWorld benchmark, especially for human goal specifications. The method achieves state-of-the-art results.

4. Analysis showing the complementary benefits of the different PET modules.

5. A study demonstrating that the PET framework is much more sample-efficient than prior work relying on DAGGER, enabling practical training.

The key idea is using LLMs in a novel way - not to directly act, but to simplify the task for a trainable agent through planning, elimination of distractions, and progress tracking. This improves generalization and sample efficiency.

The authors also discuss limitations like the inability to revisit completed sub-tasks, and suggest future work could focus on dynamic replanning or other ways LLMs could assist policy learning. Overall, the paper demonstrates creative ways to leverage LLMs to simplify embodied control tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) that uses large language models in a multi-step process to assist embodied agents by generating high-level plans, filtering irrelevant objects from observations, and tracking progress on subtasks, leading to improved performance and generalization compared to prior methods on complex instruction following tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on comparing your paper to other research and discussing future improvements with language models:

- Your PET framework shows impressive results on the AlfWorld benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance on generalizing to human goal specifications. This demonstrates the value of using language models for planning, elimination, and tracking in embodied agents. 

- Compared to prior work like SayCan that directly uses LM scores for action selection, your method maintains a trainable policy while leveraging LMs for task simplification. This makes your approach more adaptable to different environments and modalities beyond just text.

- Using multiple LM modules in coordination is a novel concept not explored before. You show this can be more effective than relying on a single LM, since each module targets a different aspect of assisting the agent.

- There is still room for improvement in how language models are incorporated. For example, future work could explore:

1) More advanced prompting techniques to get better subtask plans from the LM. 

2) Using LMs for dynamic replanning when subtasks fail. 

3) Leveraging LMs to provide knowledge about the environment and dynamics (like reading an instruction manual).

4) Integrating commonsense reasoning and affordance modeling from LMs more tightly into the policy learning.

5) Scaling up the frameworks to more complex environments beyond AlfWorld.

Overall, your PET framework advances the state-of-the-art in effectively utilizing LM knowledge for embodied agents. The modular coordination of multiple LMs is innovative. There are many exciting avenues to further improve agents by incorporating additional LM capabilities in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are the key points about future research directions from the paper:

- The authors suggest that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) show promise for providing commonsense knowledge and procedural reasoning to assist embodied agents. However, there is still substantial room for improvement in how LLMs are leveraged. 

- Better prompting techniques could allow LLMs to provide even more useful knowledge and reasoning for embodied agents. The prompting format used in this paper is relatively simple, leaving much room for more sophisticated prompting approaches.

- LLMs could potentially be used for other aspects of assisting embodied agents beyond planning, eliminating objects, and tracking progress. For example, LLMs may be able to provide better generalization and few-shot adaptation by reading instruction manuals or other documents related to new environments.

- More advanced agent architectures could be developed that are even better suited for leveraging the outputs of LLMs. The Action Attention architecture in this paper is a simple proof-of-concept.

- Multi-agent coordination involving multiple LLMs assisting the same agent in complementary ways could be explored. This paper already uses separate LLMs for planning, eliminating objects, and tracking progress, but more intricate coordination may be beneficial.

- Improved training procedures and architectures for the agent policy itself, beyond just leveraging LLMs, could lead to further gains. The PET framework aims to assist the agent but there are still improvements to be made in the agent's own learning.

In summary, the authors suggest many promising directions for improving how LLMs are leveraged to assist embodied agents, as well as improvements to the agents themselves beyond just utilizing LLMs. Substantial progress can still be made in this area beyond the PET framework proposed in this paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the hypothetical paper:

The paper explores the potential for large language models (LLMs) to assist embodied agents in planning and executing complex tasks. The authors propose a framework called PET (Plan, Eliminate, Track) that leverages LLMs in three key ways - generating high-level plans from natural language instructions, eliminating irrelevant objects/receptacles from observations, and tracking progress on subtasks. Experiments in a simulated household environment (AlfWorld) show PET leads to improved performance over prior methods, especially on human-provided goals requiring generalization. The authors discuss limitations of directly using LLMs as agents, and argue that complementary systems like PET that apply LLM knowledge while maintaining a learnable low-level policy have more potential going forward. They suggest future work on re-planning capabilities and integrating additional LLM knowledge like reading manuals. Overall, the paper makes a case for judiciously applying LLM knowledge to simplify tasks for embodied agents, rather than treating LLMs as complete solutions themselves.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to assist embodied agents in performing tasks specified by natural language instructions. The authors propose a framework called Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) that leverages different capabilities of LLMs to simplify the control problem. The Plan module uses an LLM to generate high-level subtasks for a given task description. The Eliminate module uses an LLM question-answering model to mask irrelevant objects from the observation. The Track module uses an LLM to detect when subtasks are completed. These components work together to help guide an agent through completing multi-step tasks. 

Experiments on the AlfWorld benchmark show that the PET framework leads to better generalization to novel human goal specifications compared to prior methods. The authors demonstrate that each component of PET provides complementary benefits. The Plan and Track modules together help significantly by structuring tasks into simpler subgoals. The Eliminate module is most useful when applied to these subgoals rather than directly to the full task. The results suggest that large pre-trained language models are a promising source of world knowledge to simplify planning and control for embodied agents. However, directly using LLMs as agents has limitations. The PET framework offers a way to leverage LLMs as assistants while maintaining a trainable policy module. There is still substantial room for improvement, for example, by adding capabilities for dynamic replanning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) to leverage large language models (LLMs) to assist embodied agents in completing tasks. The Plan module uses an LLM to generate a high-level plan by breaking down a complex task into simpler sub-tasks. The Eliminate module uses a QA model to identify and mask irrelevant objects in the observation to reduce noise. The Track module uses a QA model to track completion of sub-tasks. These modules simplify the task for a low-level policy module called Action Attention, which is trained with imitation learning on expert demonstrations. The key idea is to use the knowledge in LLMs for planning, progress tracking, and observation filtering to make the control problem easier rather than having the LLM directly act as the agent. Experiments on the AlfWorld benchmark show PET leads to better generalization to human goal specifications compared to prior methods.

The PET framework illustrates an effective way to utilize the knowledge encoded in large pre-trained language models to assist embodied agents, without needing to fine-tune the LLMs or have them directly act as the policy. There is still room for improvement, for example, by having the LLMs provide more detailed instructions/advice to the agent rather than just high-level sub-tasks, or by enabling dynamic replanning if the agent gets off track. Overall, leveraging LLMs as assistants rather than actors is a promising direction for combining their capabilities with trainable control policies.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of using large language models (LLMs) to assist embodied agents in completing complex tasks. Some key points:

- LLMs have shown promise for high-level planning and reasoning, but directly using them as the agent policy has limitations (e.g. limited input lengths, inefficient fine-tuning, bias from pre-training). 

- Instead of using LLMs directly as the policy, the paper proposes the PET (Plan, Eliminate, Track) framework to leverage LLMs to simplify the control problem for the agent.

- The Plan module uses an LLM to generate high-level subtasks for a given complex task. This breaks down the task into simpler steps.

- The Eliminate module uses a QA model to mask out irrelevant objects/receptacles in the observation, making it easier for the agent to focus on the current subtask.

- The Track module uses a QA model to track completion of subtasks and progress through the plan.

- Experiments on the AlfWorld benchmark show PET assists a transformer-based agent, improving performance especially on generalizing to human goal specifications.

- There is still room for improvement in how LLMs are utilized, e.g. using them for re-planning if a subtask is undone, or having them "read" instruction manuals to get knowledge about the environment upfront.

In summary, the key idea is to use LLMs for high-level reasoning to simplify the control problem, rather than directly as the policy. The PET framework demonstrates this can improve task performance and generalization. But there are still many opportunities to further leverage LLMs' knowledge.
