# Self-collaboration Code Generation via ChatGPT

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can self-collaboration among large language models be leveraged to improve complex code generation?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) By assigning different roles and responsibilities to multiple copies of the same LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) through role instructions, they can effectively form a virtual team and collaborate on code generation in a way that improves results. 2) Incorporating principles from software development methodologies like the waterfall model into the self-collaboration framework can help organize the virtual team and enhance the efficiency and quality of the collaborative code generation process.3) This self-collaboration approach with virtual teaming and software development principles can enable LLMs like ChatGPT to handle more complex coding tasks that they struggle with using standard direct generation.The paper aims to demonstrate through experiments that:- Self-collaboration code generation significantly outperforms direct generation by a single LLM on code generation benchmarks.- Following a simple software dev methodology allows the virtual team to achieve good results with minimal customization of role instructions. - The approach enables LLMs to generate code for complex real-world tasks that fail using direct generation.So in summary, the central research direction is leveraging self-collaboration among LLMs to improve complex code generation, with the key hypotheses focusing on role-based teaming and integration of software development principles. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a self-collaboration framework for code generation that allows multiple large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to collaborate and interact. 2. Using role instructions to implement division of labor, where each LLM takes on a specific role (e.g. analyst, coder, tester) responsible for a particular subtask.3. Incorporating software development methodology into the framework to organize the collaboration through defined stages and roles. 4. Instantiating an example collaborative team with 3 ChatGPT roles following a simplified waterfall model with analysis, coding, and testing stages.5. Showing through experiments that self-collaboration code generation significantly improves performance over direct generation by a single LLM. The 3-role ChatGPT team achieves state-of-the-art results on code generation benchmarks, even surpassing GPT-4.6. Demonstrating via case studies that the self-collaboration approach can effectively handle complex real-world tasks that direct generation fails on.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel self-collaboration framework for code generation that allows LLMs to work together in specialized roles, guided by software development principles, to improve code generation for complex tasks. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies show the benefits of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes a self-collaboration framework for code generation where multiple large language models act as distinct roles and interact to address complex programming tasks, following software development principles to organize the collaborative workflow.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a quick analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of code generation:- Main contribution is proposing a self-collaboration framework for code generation using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The key idea is to have multiple LLMs take on distinct roles (analyst, coder, tester) and collaborate to generate code.  - Most prior work on code generation with LLMs focuses solely on the coding stage. This paper incorporates multiple stages like analysis, coding, testing inspired by software development processes. The self-collaboration between roles across stages aims to improve code quality.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on code generation benchmarks by the self-collaborating ChatGPT, even outperforming GPT-4 in some cases. Quantitative comparisons to other LLMs like Codex, Incoder, etc. are provided.- In addition to benchmarks, case studies on complex real-world tasks showcase the effectiveness over direct code generation. The modular and interactive approach helps handle intricacies.- The self-collaboration framework is general and easily extensible by modifying the team composition, roles, and stages. No training or dataset specific prompting is needed.- Concurrent work like CAMEL has explored similar LLM self-collaboration but focused on case studies rather than comprehensive analysis like this paper. Overall, the proposed approach is novel and shows promising results.In summary, the key differentiating factors are the incorporation of software development processes into code generation using LLMs, the extensive quantitative experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, and the generalizable self-collaboration framework requiring minimal customization. The results validate the benefit of leveraging collaborative roles and multi-stage workflows for advancing code generation.
