## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a self-collaboration framework for code generation using large language models like ChatGPT. The key idea is to leverage software development principles to break down complex coding tasks and assign them to different "roles" played by the language models. Specifically, the authors instantiate a simple virtual team with three roles - analyst, coder, and tester. The analyst decomposes requirements and makes high-level plans. The coder implements code based on the analyst's guidance and tester's feedback. The tester checks the code functionality and reports issues. By collaborating through natural language interaction, the roles form an autonomous system that can generate code for complex requirements without human intervention. The self-collaboration approach is shown to significantly improve the code generation performance of ChatGPT across several benchmark datasets.
