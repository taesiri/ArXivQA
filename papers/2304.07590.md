# [Self-collaboration Code Generation via ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07590)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can self-collaboration among large language models be leveraged to improve complex code generation?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) By assigning different roles and responsibilities to multiple copies of the same LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) through role instructions, they can effectively form a virtual team and collaborate on code generation in a way that improves results. 

2) Incorporating principles from software development methodologies like the waterfall model into the self-collaboration framework can help organize the virtual team and enhance the efficiency and quality of the collaborative code generation process.

3) This self-collaboration approach with virtual teaming and software development principles can enable LLMs like ChatGPT to handle more complex coding tasks that they struggle with using standard direct generation.

The paper aims to demonstrate through experiments that:

- Self-collaboration code generation significantly outperforms direct generation by a single LLM on code generation benchmarks.

- Following a simple software dev methodology allows the virtual team to achieve good results with minimal customization of role instructions. 

- The approach enables LLMs to generate code for complex real-world tasks that fail using direct generation.

So in summary, the central research direction is leveraging self-collaboration among LLMs to improve complex code generation, with the key hypotheses focusing on role-based teaming and integration of software development principles. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of this approach.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-collaboration framework for code generation using large language models like ChatGPT. The key idea is to leverage software development principles to break down complex coding tasks and assign them to different "roles" played by the language models. Specifically, the authors instantiate a simple virtual team with three roles - analyst, coder, and tester. The analyst decomposes requirements and makes high-level plans. The coder implements code based on the analyst's guidance and tester's feedback. The tester checks the code functionality and reports issues. By collaborating through natural language interaction, the roles form an autonomous system that can generate code for complex requirements without human intervention. The self-collaboration approach is shown to significantly improve the code generation performance of ChatGPT across several benchmark datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?
