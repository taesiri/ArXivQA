# [Enhance DNN Adversarial Robustness and Efficiency via Injecting Noise to   Non-Essential Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04325)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) face two critical challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks which can cause catastrophic failures, and increasing computational demands as models become more complex. 

- Prior methods to improve robustness like adversarial training or injecting noise uniformly into all neurons often compromise accuracy or efficiency. 

- There is a need for techniques that can simultaneously improve adversarial robustness and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes only injecting noise into "non-essential" neurons, which are less important for representation learning. This protects the critical "essential" neurons.  

- It introduces a learning-based approximation method to efficiently identify essential and non-essential neurons in each layer, without needing extra computations.

- Noise injection is done by directly replacing non-essential neurons with their low-precision approximate values from the selection step. This introduces pseudo-Gaussian noise with minimal overhead.

- Structured noise injection constraints are also introduced to further improve hardware efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- A novel non-uniform noise injection technique that enhances robustness and efficiency by protecting essential neurons and injecting noise into non-essential ones.

- An efficient neuron selection algorithm requiring minimal additional computations integrated with the noise injection process.

- Analysis showing significant robustness improvements against various attacks with minimal impact on accuracy and up to 90%+ reduction in computations.

- Exploration of structured noise injection patterns for optimized hardware efficiency.

In summary, the key idea is protecting critical neurons while strategically injecting noise to trivial ones, enabled by an efficient selection process, to simultaneously improve adversarial robustness and execution efficiency of DNNs.
