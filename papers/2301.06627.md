# Dissociating language and thought in large language models: a cognitive   perspective

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How do contemporary large language models (LLMs) compare to humans in terms of formal linguistic competence versus functional linguistic competence? The key concepts in this research question are:- Formal linguistic competence: Knowledge of the rules and statistical patterns that characterize a language (syntax, morphology, phonology, etc.)- Functional linguistic competence: The ability to use language in context, which depends on non-linguistic cognitive capacities like reasoning, social cognition, world knowledge, etc. - Large language models (LLMs): AI systems trained on massive text corpora to predict upcoming words, like BERT, GPT-3, etc.The main hypothesis appears to be that while LLMs have made impressive progress at acquiring formal linguistic competence, they still lack human-like functional linguistic competence. The authors evaluate this hypothesis by reviewing evidence on:- The formal vs functional linguistic capacities of humans, based on cognitive science and neuroscience research- The successes of LLMs at capturing many complex linguistic phenomena, arguing they are good models of human language processing- The limitations of LLMs when it comes to reasoning, world knowledge, pragmatic language use, and other markers of functional competenceThe overall goal seems to be to clarify where contemporary LLMs succeed and fail as cognitive models of language, and outline paths forward for developing models that can use language in more complete, human-like ways. Let me know if you need any clarification on the key research question or hypothesis!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper makes a key distinction between formal linguistic competence and functional linguistic competence. The main contributions are:1. Formal linguistic competence refers to knowledge of the rules and statistical patterns that characterize a language. Functional linguistic competence refers to the cognitive abilities needed to use language in real-world situations, which draw on non-linguistic capacities like reasoning, world knowledge, situation modeling, and social cognition. 2. Evidence from cognitive science and neuroscience shows that language relies on distinct mechanisms from the rest of cognition in the human brain. This motivates functionally separating language skills from broader reasoning skills when evaluating models.3. Contemporary large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have made impressive progress at acquiring formal linguistic competence. They capture complex linguistic phenomena like long-distance dependencies and abstraction. 4. However, LLMs still fail at many tasks requiring functional competence. They struggle with mathematical reasoning, lack flexible world knowledge, cannot model evolving situations, and lack pragmatic inferential abilities.5. The authors argue that progress in language AI requires combining language models with additional components specialized for reasoning, planning, etc. The brain's modularity provides a guide. Separate benchmarks for formal and functional competence are also needed.In summary, the key distinction is between language-specific skills (formal competence) and general cognitive skills needed for using language (functional competence). LLMs succeed at the former but not the latter. Advancing language AI requires integrating language modules with broader reasoning modules, guided by the brain's modularity.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper argues that while large language models like GPT-3 have made impressive progress in acquiring formal linguistic competence (knowledge of rules and patterns), they still lack functional linguistic competence (the ability to use language appropriately in context), which requires non-linguistic cognitive skills like reasoning and common sense.
