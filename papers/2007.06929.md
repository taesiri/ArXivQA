# Rethinking Image Inpainting via a Mutual Encoder-Decoder with Feature   Equalizations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing a new deep learning method for image inpainting that can better recover both structure and texture in the filled regions. The key ideas proposed are:- Using a mutual encoder-decoder architecture that jointly learns to represent structure and texture features. - Proposing a feature equalization method to make the recovered structure and texture features more consistent. This includes channel reweighing and a new bilateral propagation activation.- Showing that by equalizing and fusing the structure and texture features, the model can generate more coherent outputs with less blurring/artifacts around hole regions compared to prior approaches.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and fusing structure and texture features in a mutually consistent way will improve deep image inpainting results, especially in recovering finer details and reducing inconsistencies around hole boundaries. The experiments aim to validate if the proposed mutual encoder-decoder model with feature equalization can achieve these improved results.
