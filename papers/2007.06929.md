# [Rethinking Image Inpainting via a Mutual Encoder-Decoder with Feature   Equalizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06929)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on developing a new deep learning method for image inpainting that can better recover both structure and texture in the filled regions. The key ideas proposed are:

- Using a mutual encoder-decoder architecture that jointly learns to represent structure and texture features. 

- Proposing a feature equalization method to make the recovered structure and texture features more consistent. This includes channel reweighing and a new bilateral propagation activation.

- Showing that by equalizing and fusing the structure and texture features, the model can generate more coherent outputs with less blurring/artifacts around hole regions compared to prior approaches.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that explicitly modeling and fusing structure and texture features in a mutually consistent way will improve deep image inpainting results, especially in recovering finer details and reducing inconsistencies around hole boundaries. The experiments aim to validate if the proposed mutual encoder-decoder model with feature equalization can achieve these improved results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a mutual encoder-decoder network for image inpainting. The CNN features from shallow layers are learned to represent textures, while features from deep layers represent structures. 

- It proposes a feature equalization method to make structure and texture features consistent with each other. This includes channel reweighing after feature concatenation, and a bilateral propagation activation function to equalize feature consistency across the whole feature map.

- Experiments show the proposed method is effective at recovering structures and textures, and performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets. In particular, it reduces blur and artifacts caused by inconsistent structure and texture features.

In summary, the key contribution is a mutual encoder-decoder architecture with a novel feature equalization method to produce consistent structure and texture features. This allows joint recovery of missing image structures and textures during inpainting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a mutual encoder-decoder network with feature equalization for deep image inpainting. The key idea is to use separate branches to fill missing structures and textures in the CNN feature space, and then equalize the features to make them mutually consistent before decoding to generate the final output image. This approach helps reduce blurring and artifacts caused by inconsistent structure and texture representations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this image inpainting paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper proposes a new mutual encoder-decoder architecture with feature equalizations for image inpainting. Most recent inpainting methods use some form of encoder-decoder, but the use of a mutual encoder-decoder with separate branches for structures and textures is novel. 

- The feature equalization through channel reweighting and the proposed bilateral propagation activation is also a new contribution for fusing the structure and texture information. This allows the filled structures and textures to be more coherent.

- Compared to two-stage inpainting methods like EdgeConnect, this method performs joint structure and texture recovery in a single model. The mutual encoder-decoder helps correlate the structure and texture features during training.

- The results demonstrate improved visual quality over recent state-of-the-art methods like PartialConv, GatedConv, Coherent Semantic Attention, etc. Both numerical metrics and human evaluations confirm these improvements.

- The method seems to generalize well to both centered and irregular mask holes. Many recent inpainting papers focus only on irregular masks.

- The ablation studies validate the contributions of the key components like the bilateral propagation and the separate structure/texture branches. This gives confidence that the architecture improvements are meaningful.

Overall, I think this paper makes nice contributions in the encoder-decoder design and feature fusion for inpainting. The results show clearer improvements over recent works compared to incremental changes in many papers. The mutual encoder-decoder and feature equalization approach seems like a promising direction for further exploration in inpainting and related tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other network architectures and loss functions to further improve inpainting performance. The authors used a simple encoder-decoder architecture in this work, but mention that more complex architectures like the generative multi-column CNN could be explored. Different loss functions like a learned perceptual loss could also help.

- Applying the proposed mutual encoder-decoder framework and feature equalization techniques to other image restoration tasks like denoising, super-resolution, etc. The authors suggest these techniques could be generalized.

- Evaluating the proposed approach on larger and more diverse datasets. The experiments in this work were limited to a few standard datasets like CelebA, Paris StreetView, etc. Testing on larger and more varied datasets could reveal new challenges.

- Investigating the proposed bilateral propagation activation function more thoroughly. The authors mention further analysis like visualizations and ablation studies on the spatial/range components could provide more insights.

- Extending the approach to video inpainting. The authors suggest the consistency and coherency enforced by their approach could be useful for coherent video inpainting.

In summary, the main future directions are around exploring architectural variants, applying the approach to other tasks, more extensive evaluation, further analysis of core techniques like BPA, and extension to video. The authors seem to have provided good high-level suggestions for how this line of research could be advanced.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a mutual encoder-decoder with feature equalizations for image inpainting. It uses the deep layer features from an encoder as structure representations and the shallow layer features as texture representations. These features are processed separately by two branches to fill holes in multiple scales. The outputs of the two branches are fused and equalized to make the structure and texture features consistent. The feature equalization includes channel reweighing for attention consistency and a bilateral propagation activation function for spatial consistency. The equalized features are used to supplement the decoder features for image reconstruction. Experiments show the proposed method performs well in recovering structures and textures when filling holes, and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a deep learning approach for image inpainting that utilizes a mutual encoder-decoder architecture with feature equalizations. The key idea is to leverage both deep features that represent structure and shallow features that represent texture from an encoder, fill in missing regions of these features separately, and then fuse them together in a way that makes the structure and texture representations consistent. Specifically, the deep encoder features are sent to a "structure branch" and shallow encoder features to a "texture branch", each of which fills holes in the features. The outputs of these branches are concatenated, and a feature equalization module is applied that first reweights channel attentions to be consistent, and then uses a novel bilateral propagation activation to equalize features spatially as well. The equalized features are then used to supplement decoder features through skip connections, leading to an output image with reduced blurring/artifacts caused by inconsistent structure and texture representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets for image inpainting demonstrate the approach is effective for filling both regular and irregular holes compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, this work makes the key contributions of proposing a mutual encoder-decoder network architecture for joint structure and texture feature learning, and a feature equalization method to make these representations consistent before decoding. Experiments validate the approach can generate more coherent results with less artifacts for the image inpainting task.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper proposes a mutual encoder-decoder network with feature equalizations for image inpainting. The key idea is to utilize both deep layer features that represent image structures and shallow layer features that represent textures. These features are passed through separate branches to fill holes at multiple scales. The outputs of the two branches are then fused and equalized to make the structure and texture representations consistent. Specifically, channel attention reweighting is first applied to make channel activations consistent. Then a novel bilateral propagation activation function is proposed to enable equalization across the whole spatial feature map, ensuring global continuity and local feature consistency. The equalized features are used to supplement decoder features through skip connections for final image reconstruction. This allows generating results where structures and textures are coherent with each other and with surrounding image content.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It addresses the problem of inconsistent structure and texture features in deep image inpainting methods. Existing methods use separate encoder-decoders to recover structures and textures in a step-by-step manner. However, the learned features are not consistent with each other, leading to blurry results. 

- The paper proposes a mutual encoder-decoder framework to jointly learn structure and texture features for inpainting. It extracts structure features from deep layers and texture features from shallow layers of the encoder. 

- It proposes feature equalization techniques to make the structure and texture features consistent. This includes channel reweighing for feature fusion and a bilateral propagation activation function for spatial equalization.

- The consistent structure and texture features are then used to supplement the decoder features via skip connections for final image reconstruction.

- Experiments show the proposed method generates more coherent inpainting results and outperforms state-of-the-art methods visually and quantitatively. It is effective in reducing blur and artifacts caused by inconsistent features.

In summary, the key contribution is a mutual learning framework with feature equalization to address the problem of inconsistent structure and texture representations in deep inpainting methods. The goal is to generate more coherent inpainting results.
