# [Visual Exemplar Driven Task-Prompting for Unified Perception in   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01788)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we enable comprehensive evaluation and improvement of multi-task learning methods on common perception tasks for autonomous driving? 

The key points are:

- Existing multi-task learning methods are designed for different tasks and datasets, making it hard to compare their performance on autonomous driving tasks. 

- There is a need to systematically evaluate multi-task learning methods on major perception tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, drivable area segmentation, and lane detection using a large-scale driving dataset.

- The paper provides an in-depth analysis of various multi-task learning techniques under different settings on the BDD100K driving dataset. 

- The analysis shows existing methods have limitations in handling multiple driving perception tasks together.

- To address this, the paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework called VE-Prompt that utilizes visual exemplars and task-specific prompting to learn better task-specific representations.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that introducing visual exemplar driven task-prompting can enable more effective multi-task learning on key perception tasks for autonomous driving. The paper aims to demonstrate this via comprehensive evaluation and a new method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides an in-depth analysis and empirical study of popular multi-task learning methods on autonomous driving tasks using the large-scale BDD100K dataset. The authors systematically investigate various multi-task settings like task scheduling, task balancing, and learning with partial labels. 

2. The paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework called VE-Prompt that introduces visual exemplar driven task-specific prompting. This provides high-quality task-specific knowledge to guide the model to learn better task-specific representations and alleviate negative transfer.

3. The VE-Prompt framework efficiently bridges transformer encoders and convolutional layers for accurate and efficient unified perception for autonomous driving. 

4. Comprehensive experiments show VE-Prompt outperforms competitive multi-task baselines by a large margin on all tasks and settings on the BDD100K dataset. The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed visual exemplar prompting and task-specific prompting strategies.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the VE-Prompt framework for multi-task learning in autonomous driving using visual exemplar driven task-specific prompting to provide high-quality task-specific knowledge. The extensive experiments and analyses also provide useful insights into multi-task learning for self-driving perception.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a visual exemplar driven task-prompting framework called VE-Prompt for unified perception in autonomous driving, which introduces task-specific visual prompts generated from exemplars to guide the model toward learning high-quality task-specific representations and efficiently bridges transformer and convolutional layers to handle multiple common perception tasks simultaneously.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in multi-task learning for autonomous driving:

- The paper provides a systematic study and evaluation of various popular multi-task learning methods on common perception tasks for autonomous driving. This kind of thorough analysis and benchmarking on real-world driving datasets is lacking in prior work. 

- Most prior multi-task learning research has focused on natural language processing tasks or generic computer vision datasets. This paper tailors its analysis specifically for autonomous driving tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, drivable area segmentation and lane detection.

- The paper finds that existing multi-task learning methods have difficulty balancing multiple driving perception tasks, leading to negative transfer. The proposed VE-Prompt framework addresses this through visual exemplar driven task-specific prompting.

- VE-Prompt incorporates both convolutional networks and transformers in an efficient architecture. Most prior work relies solely on convolutional networks. The hybrid design allows capturing both local and global context effectively.

- Unlike prompting methods in NLP that use text, VE-Prompt generates visual prompts from exemplars containing objects/shapes related to each task. This is more intuitive for guiding visual perception models.

- Experiments show VE-Prompt significantly outperforms existing multi-task learning baselines on the large-scale BDD100K dataset. The framework also surpasses individual task-specific models unlike most prior work.

In summary, this paper provides new insights into multi-task learning for autonomous driving by extensive benchmarking and proposing a tailored prompting framework to improve learning of task-specific representations in a computationally efficient hybrid architecture. The visual prompting approach is also novel for vision compared to NLP methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust pseudo-labeling methods or designing specific heads for lane detection to further improve performance on the lane detection task. The authors note that their method still lags behind the single-task model on lane detection, so improving performance on this task is an area for future work.

- Applying the proposed visual exemplar driven prompting approach to other computer vision applications beyond autonomous driving. The authors suggest the prompt generation method using visual exemplars is general and could be beneficial in other vision tasks.

- Exploring different prompt designs and incorporation methods. The authors propose two prompting strategies (pre-head and post-head) but there may be other effective ways to integrate the visual exemplar prompts.

- Scaling up the approach to more tasks. The current method covers four perception tasks for autonomous driving but could be extended to handle more tasks simultaneously. 

- Improving the efficiency and compatibility of bridging CNNs and Transformers. The authors use both CNN and Transformer components to balance accuracy and efficiency but further work could optimize this hybrid architecture.

- Evaluating the approach on more diverse and complex driving datasets. Testing the method on more varied and challenging real-world driving data could reveal areas for improvement.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more advanced prompting techniques tailored for autonomous driving tasks, applying the approach to other vision problems, and scaling up and improving the efficiency of the multi-task architecture.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents Visual Exemplar Driven Task-Prompting (VE-Prompt), a multi-task learning framework for unified perception in autonomous driving. The authors first benchmark popular multi-task learning methods on the large-scale BDD100K driving dataset covering object detection, semantic segmentation, drivable area segmentation, and lane detection. They find existing methods underperform on most tasks compared to single-task baselines due to negative transfer. To address this, VE-Prompt introduces visual exemplars as prompts to provide task-specific information and mitigate negative transfer. Specifically, class-related image regions and segmentation masks are generated as exemplars to produce task prompts using CLIP. VE-Prompt also efficiently combines CNN and transformer encoders to enable accurate and efficient multi-task learning. Experiments show VE-Prompt outperforms competitive multi-task methods by a large margin across all tasks on BDD100K. The visual exemplar prompts enable learning high-quality task representations to handle multiple perception tasks in a unified model for autonomous driving.
