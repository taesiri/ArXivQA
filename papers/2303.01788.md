# [Visual Exemplar Driven Task-Prompting for Unified Perception in   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01788)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we enable comprehensive evaluation and improvement of multi-task learning methods on common perception tasks for autonomous driving? 

The key points are:

- Existing multi-task learning methods are designed for different tasks and datasets, making it hard to compare their performance on autonomous driving tasks. 

- There is a need to systematically evaluate multi-task learning methods on major perception tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, drivable area segmentation, and lane detection using a large-scale driving dataset.

- The paper provides an in-depth analysis of various multi-task learning techniques under different settings on the BDD100K driving dataset. 

- The analysis shows existing methods have limitations in handling multiple driving perception tasks together.

- To address this, the paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework called VE-Prompt that utilizes visual exemplars and task-specific prompting to learn better task-specific representations.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that introducing visual exemplar driven task-prompting can enable more effective multi-task learning on key perception tasks for autonomous driving. The paper aims to demonstrate this via comprehensive evaluation and a new method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides an in-depth analysis and empirical study of popular multi-task learning methods on autonomous driving tasks using the large-scale BDD100K dataset. The authors systematically investigate various multi-task settings like task scheduling, task balancing, and learning with partial labels. 

2. The paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework called VE-Prompt that introduces visual exemplar driven task-specific prompting. This provides high-quality task-specific knowledge to guide the model to learn better task-specific representations and alleviate negative transfer.

3. The VE-Prompt framework efficiently bridges transformer encoders and convolutional layers for accurate and efficient unified perception for autonomous driving. 

4. Comprehensive experiments show VE-Prompt outperforms competitive multi-task baselines by a large margin on all tasks and settings on the BDD100K dataset. The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed visual exemplar prompting and task-specific prompting strategies.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the VE-Prompt framework for multi-task learning in autonomous driving using visual exemplar driven task-specific prompting to provide high-quality task-specific knowledge. The extensive experiments and analyses also provide useful insights into multi-task learning for self-driving perception.
