# [Contact Energy Based Hindsight Experience Prioritization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02677)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel prioritization scheme called Contact Energy Based Prioritization (CEBP) to improve sample efficiency in multi-goal reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. CEBP prioritizes experiences in the replay buffer based on the contact forces occurring between the gripper and object, measured by touch sensors on the gripper, as well as the displacement of the manipulated object. The intuition is that contact-rich experiences involving object manipulation are the most valuable for learning. A sigmoid function is used to smooth the contact forces to address issues with collisions generating misleadingly high forces. CEBP is evaluated on three simulated benchmark tasks - pick-and-place, push, and slide - using a 7-DOF Fetch robotic arm in MuJoCo. Results show CEBP consistently outperforms prioritization based on temporal difference error, maximum entropy distribution, object energy, a touch-based method using discrete force values, and uniform sampling. The trained pick-and-place policy is also deployed on a real Franka robot using Sim2Real transfer with ArUco marker detection. Overall, the paper demonstrates that prioritizing experiences based on contact forces and object displacement significantly improves learning efficiency and performance for robotic manipulation tasks.
