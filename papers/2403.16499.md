## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise for pretraining deep networks on medical images using unlabeled data. However, most prior SSL works do not fully exploit anatomy-oriented medical images, which have multiple intersecting or parallel slices capturing the same organ from different orientations. As these slices depend on anatomical landmarks, SSL tasks utilizing this spatial relationship can teach networks about organ anatomy and better prepare them for downstream tasks.  

Methods:
This paper proposes two complementary SSL pretext tasks for medical images with anatomy-oriented slices:

1) Regressing relative orientations between slices by predicting their intersection lines in the form of distance-based heatmaps. This requires understanding anatomical landmarks defining the imaging planes.

2) Regressing relative locations of parallel slices in a stack by predicting slice order. This requires visual understanding of anatomical changes across the stack to infer spatial relationships. 

A multitask learning approach combines both tasks. The tasks require no manual annotations, instead exploiting spatial attributes in image headers.

Contributions:

- Two SSL pretext tasks using inherent spatial properties of anatomy-oriented medical images to teach deep networks about organ anatomy.

- Demonstrated state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on two downstream tasks (cardiac segmentation and knee diagnosis) against competitors, especially in low-data regimes. Showed both pretext tasks can be learned and complementary for better representations.

- Simple, easy to implement ideas advancing the underexplored area of exploiting anatomical position information for self-supervision, applicable to large quantities of clinical data.

In summary, this work introduced effective SSL pretext tasks tailored for multi-view anatomy-oriented medical images to better utilize their spatial relationships for learning about anatomy. The benefits for transfer learning are thoroughly demonstrated on medical image analysis tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two complementary self-supervised pretext tasks, regressing relative orientations and locations of anatomy-oriented imaging planes, for effectively pretraining networks on medical images with multiple views of anatomical structures to improve performance when transferred to downstream tasks like segmentation and diagnosis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two complementary self-supervising pretext tasks for transfer learning of medical image data with anatomy-oriented imaging planes:

1) Regressing the relative orientations of intersecting imaging planes based on their intersection lines. This requires the network to gain an understanding of the anatomical landmarks that define the imaging planes.

2) Regressing the relative locations of parallel imaging planes (e.g. slices) within an imaging stack. This requires understanding the within-slice content and cross-slice context focused on the imaged organ. 

The paper demonstrates through experiments that networks pretrained with these tasks can achieve better performance when transferred to downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and classification, compared to other self-supervised pretext tasks. The key advantage is that the proposed tasks are tailored to leverage the spatial alignment relationship in multi-view medical images to learn representations focused on the anatomy.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Anatomy-oriented imaging planes: The paper focuses on a specific type of medical image data that uses standard imaging planes defined with respect to the anatomy of the organ being imaged. Examples are cardiac MRI and knee MRI.

- Self-supervised learning (SSL): The paper proposes self-supervised pretext tasks that allow models to be pretrained on unlabeled medical images by exploiting inherent properties of the data.

- Transfer learning: The efficacy of the proposed SSL pretext tasks is evaluated by the extent of improvement they provide on downstream tasks through transfer learning with limited labeled data. 

- Relative orientation regression: One of the two proposed pretext tasks. It involves predicting the relative orientation (intersecting lines) between anatomy-oriented imaging planes of the same scan.

- Relative location regression: The other proposed pretext task. It involves predicting the relative locations of slices within a stack of parallel anatomy-oriented image planes.  

- Multitask learning: Integration of the two complementary pretext tasks for joint training.

- Semantic segmentation: One of the two downstream tasks used for evaluation, involves multi-structural segmentation of organs in medical images.  

- Computer-aided diagnosis: The other downstream task, formulated as classification of scans into normal vs abnormal cases.
