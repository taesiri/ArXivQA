# [Bridging Background Knowledge Gaps in Translation with Automatic   Explicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01308)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is implicit cultural knowledge that is not shared across language communities. This can make machine translation less effective for cross-cultural communication.  
- For example, when translating from a source to target language, entities that are well-known in the source language may not be familiar to target language speakers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using "explicitation", which is when a translator adds explanatory information to make implicit knowledge explicit. 
- For example, translating "Sambre" to "the Sambre river" to clarify it is a river.

- They develop methods to automatically detect good candidates for explicitation in parallel corpora using alignment techniques.

- They also propose an algorithm to decide when an entity needs explicitation based on properties like the frequency of the entity in each language.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the explicitation problem for machine translation.
- Analysis of real examples of explicitation collected manually from a parallel corpus.
- Methods to automatically detect explicitation candidates.  
- Algorithm to determine when explicitation should be applied to an entity.
- Analysis showing their detection method identifies better explicitation candidates.
- Evaluation in a multilingual question answering task showing value of explicitation.

Overall, the paper addresses the problem of implicit cultural knowledge in machine translation and shows initial progress towards automatic explicitation to make this knowledge explicit. The main innovation is in formulating and developing methods to detect and generate explicitation.
