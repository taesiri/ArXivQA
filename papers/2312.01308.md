# [Bridging Background Knowledge Gaps in Translation with Automatic   Explicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01308)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is implicit cultural knowledge that is not shared across language communities. This can make machine translation less effective for cross-cultural communication.  
- For example, when translating from a source to target language, entities that are well-known in the source language may not be familiar to target language speakers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using "explicitation", which is when a translator adds explanatory information to make implicit knowledge explicit. 
- For example, translating "Sambre" to "the Sambre river" to clarify it is a river.

- They develop methods to automatically detect good candidates for explicitation in parallel corpora using alignment techniques.

- They also propose an algorithm to decide when an entity needs explicitation based on properties like the frequency of the entity in each language.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the explicitation problem for machine translation.
- Analysis of real examples of explicitation collected manually from a parallel corpus.
- Methods to automatically detect explicitation candidates.  
- Algorithm to determine when explicitation should be applied to an entity.
- Analysis showing their detection method identifies better explicitation candidates.
- Evaluation in a multilingual question answering task showing value of explicitation.

Overall, the paper addresses the problem of implicit cultural knowledge in machine translation and shows initial progress towards automatic explicitation to make this knowledge explicit. The main innovation is in formulating and developing methods to detect and generate explicitation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes automatic methods for detecting and generating explicitation, additional explanatory information bridging cultural gaps, in machine translation to improve cross-lingual language understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating an automatic method for generating explanatory information (known as "explicitation") to enhance machine translation between languages and bridge cultural knowledge gaps. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Proposes algorithms to automatically detect when explicitation of named entities is needed in machine translated text and generate explanatory information for the target language audience. 

- Evaluates the approach by applying it to English-Polish and English-Spanish machine translation and testing on question answering tasks. The results demonstrate improved performance, supporting the validity of their explicitation decision algorithm.

- Analyzes real examples of explicitation collected from human annotators on parallel text to categorize and understand different types of explicitation that occur across languages and cultures.

So in summary, the key contribution is advancing research towards automatically generating explanatory information in machine translation to account for cross-cultural differences in background knowledge. The paper provides empirical evidence that this can improve machine translation quality for downstream tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Explicitation - The paper focuses on a type of explicitation called "pragmatic explicitation", which involves making implicit knowledge explicit to aid understanding, especially for cross-cultural audiences. This is a key concept. 

- Machine translation - The paper studies explicitation in the context of machine translation, using parallel corpora of translated texts.

- Cross-cultural NLP - The goal of the explicitation is to bridge cultural gaps and improve NLP systems for cross-cultural users. This connects to challenges in cross-cultural NLP.

- Wikipedia - The paper discusses how Wikipedia content varies across languages and cultures, relating this to the need for explicitation.

- Types of explicitation - The paper analyzes and categorizes different types of explicitation found, like adding hypernyms, titles, nationalities.

- Automatic explicitation - A key focus is developing methods for automatic explicitation to improve machine translation and cross-cultural NLP.

- Multilinguality - The study looks at explicitation between multiple language pairs like English-Polish and English-Spanish.

So in summary, the key terms cover explicitation, machine translation, cross-cultural NLP, Wikipedia content analysis, and automatic methods for explicitation to aid multilingual understanding.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes an automatic method for detecting and generating explicitation in machine translation. What are the key components of this proposed method? Can you walk through the overall workflow?

2) The paper collects a new parallel corpus with human annotations of explicitation spans. What was the annotation process like? What instructions and questions were the human annotators given? 

3) The paper categorizes different types of explicitation, such as adding hypernyms or nationalities. Can you describe these categories and provide examples of each from Table 3? Are certain categories more common than others in the annotated data?

4) Algorithm 1 describes detecting explicitation candidates in bitext. Can you explain what an "unaligned segment" is and how the algorithm identifies related entities? What is the decide_explicitation function doing?

5) Algorithm 2 makes decisions on which entities need explicitation. What properties and thresholds are used to make this decision? How does it determine if an entity is "general" enough to not need explicitation?

6) How does the paper evaluate the quality of the explicitation decisions made by the proposed algorithms? What metrics are used and what trends do Figure 5 and Section 5.4 reveal about the algorithm's performance?

7) What baselines does the paper compare to in Section 3.1? Why is multilingual model performance on Polish QA lower than English and Spanish? What factors might influence this?

8) What additional analyses does the paper do around answer inclusion and explicitation in Section D? What trends emerge from Table 4 and what might explain them?

9) The related work mentions "pragmatic explicitation." What does this term mean and why might it be rare according to past analyses? How does it differ from the explicitation focused on in this paper?

10) The discussion relates explicitation to challenges in cross-cultural NLP and content differences in multilingual Wikipedia. Can you summarize the connections made here and how automatic explicitation could potentially help address cross-cultural content gaps?
