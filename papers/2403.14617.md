# [Videoshop: Localized Semantic Video Editing with Noise-Extrapolated   Diffusion Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14617)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional video editing is a manual and exhaustive process. Current video editing methods rely on imprecise textual instructions, struggle with introducing new independent motions, and lack the specificity needed for precise localized edits. Propagating image edits to videos is unsolved, resulting in a gap between image and video manipulation.  

Proposed Solution (Videoshop):
The paper proposes Videoshop, a training-free video editing algorithm that enables users to make localized semantic edits with fine control. Users can leverage any image editing tool to modify the first video frame however they want. Videoshop then automatically propagates those pixel-level changes to all frames, maintaining semantics, geometry, and temporally consistent motion.  

Technical Insights:
1) The latent vectors follow an approximately linear trajectory during diffusion model denoising. 
2) The VAE encoder outputs are unnormalized, causing instability.

Key Contributions:  
1) Inversion with noise extrapolation: Linear extrapolation of the noise at each timestep to guide the inversion trajectory and ensure correct latent mapping.

2) Latent normalization and rescaling: Normalizing before inversion and rescaling after diffusion stabilizes the process.  

3) Achieves superior performance over baselines in edit fidelity, source faithfulness and temporal consistency.

4) Enables editing capabilities akin to Photoshop but for videos, including adding/removing objects, appearance and texture edits, object transformations, etc. with precise localization.

In summary, Videoshop bridges the gap between image and video manipulation by building on image editing techniques. It propagates any image edit to all frames with consistent semantics and motion in a training-free manner.
