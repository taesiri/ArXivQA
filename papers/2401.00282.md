## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Symbolic regression aims to discover concise mathematical equations from data. This is a fundamental task for scientific discovery. However, the search space of possible equations grows exponentially with the number of variables, making symbolic regression computationally challenging and inapplicable beyond a small number of variables (typically 3). Existing methods also do not adequately capture the intrinsic structure and equivalences of mathematical equations.

Proposed Solution - Deep Generative Symbolic Regression (DGSR):

The key idea is to leverage deep generative models to capture the regularities and invariances of equations. Specifically:

1) DGSR uses a conditional generative model p(f|D) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder maps the dataset D into a latent representation in a way that is invariant to permutations of data points. The decoder then generates equation tokens autoregressively.

2) The model is trained end-to-end to minimize the NMSE between generated equations and data. This loss captures equation invariances like commutativity.

3) The generator p(f|D) is first pretrained on equations sampled from a prior p(f). At inference, p(f|D_obs) is refined via policy gradients to better fit the observed dataset D_obs.

Main Contributions:

1) DGSR provides a unified view of symbolic regression as inference in a conditional generative model. This perspective helps justify design choices like using NMSE loss.

2) DGSR can exploit equation invariances and achieve efficient inference by first pretraining then refining the generator at test time. This allows it to scale and generalize better than prior work.

3) Empirically, DGSR achieves significantly higher recovery of ground truth equations compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially for problems with more variables. It is also faster at inference time than RL techniques.

In summary, DGSR pushes the boundary of symbolic regression by learning to exploit mathematical structures through deep generative models. It demonstrates superior scalability and efficiency over existing approaches on several benchmark problems. The proposed framework also opens up new research directions for representing and discovering mathematical knowledge.
