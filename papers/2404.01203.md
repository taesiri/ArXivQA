# [Video Interpolation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01203)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video frame interpolation is the task of generating intermediate frames between two input video frames. It has applications like generating slow motion videos or increasing frame rates.
- Existing methods rely on linear or unambiguous motion and fail when the start and end frames become too different or the motion is complex. They produce blurry outputs in such cases.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes VIDIM, a generative model based on cascaded diffusion models for video interpolation.
- It first generates the target video at low resolution using a base model conditioned on input start and end frames. 
- Then a super-resolution model upsamples the low resolution video to high resolution, conditioned on original high resolution start and end frames.

Key Contributions:
- VIDIM can handle complex, nonlinear and ambiguous motion between input frames unlike previous methods.
- Explicit conditioning on start and end frames at train time and using classifier-free guidance is critical for good performance.
- Curated two new datasets - Davis-7 and UCF101-7 containing videos with large motion, for benchmarking video interpolation.
- VIDIM achieves better quantitative scores and is strongly preferred in human evaluation over previous state-of-the-art methods on these datasets.
- With increased parameters, VIDIM enjoys better sample quality showing its scalability.

Overall, the paper demonstrates how cascaded diffusion models can overcome limitations of previous methods for the task of video frame interpolation, especially on cases with large and ambiguous motion. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations showcase the superiority of VIDIM.
