# [Learning with Noisy Low-Cost MOS for Image Quality Assessment via   Dual-Bias Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15846)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called gated dual-bias calibration (GDBC) to enable robust image quality assessment (IQA) model learning from noisy low-cost mean opinion scores (LC-MOS). LC-MOS labels contain subjective bias and require very few opinion scores per image, making them cheaper but noisier than traditional labor-abundant MOS (LA-MOS). The authors model the bias between LC-MOS and LA-MOS as well as the bias between IQA models trained on them as latent Gaussian variables. They jointly estimate these dual biases using an expectation-maximization approach that calibrates an IQA model to predict unbiased LA-MOS while training on biased LC-MOS. A gating mechanism adaptively controls the bias update to avoid overadjustment. Experiments on four IQA datasets and four neural network architectures show GDBC significantly outperforms models trained directly on LC-MOS and achieves comparable performance to those trained on LA-MOS. The method demonstrates robustness to varying bias rates, annotation numbers, and parameters. Theoretical analysis and comparisons verify the superiority of jointly modeling subjective and model bias over separate calibration schemes. Overall, GDBC enables accurate IQA models to be learned from cheap but noisy labels.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a gated dual-bias calibration method to learn robust image quality assessment models from noisy low-cost mean opinion scores by jointly inferring and suppressing the subjective bias and model bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an alternative optimization based dual-bias (including subjective bias and model bias) calibration method for robust IQA model learning from noisy low-cost MOS (LC-MOS). This significantly reduces the learning cost.

2. Developing a gated dual-bias calibration (GDBC) module to adaptively update the estimated subjective bias by measuring the stability of IQA model learning in neighboring iterations. This reduces the risk of overadjustment. 

3. Verifying the effectiveness of the proposed GDBC method from both theoretical and experimental analysis. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance when very few opinion scores are available for each image.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a method to learn robust image quality assessment (IQA) models from low-cost and noisy mean opinion scores (MOS), by calibrating both the subjective bias in the scores and the resulting model bias. This allows high-quality IQA with much lower annotation cost.

The paper focuses on learning robust IQA models from noisy LC-MOS labels that only require very few opinion scores per image. It represents the difference between LC-MOS and LA-MOS as subjective bias and the difference between IQA models trained on them as model bias. The key idea is to use an EM algorithm to jointly estimate and calibrate these dual biases so the IQA model trained on LC-MOS approaches the performance of that trained on expensive LA-MOS. Experiments on deep IQA models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed gated dual-bias calibration method.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a gated dual-bias calibration (GDBC) module to handle the subjective bias and model bias when learning IQA models from low-cost MOS (LC-MOS). Can you explain in detail how the GDBC module works through alternating subjective bias estimation and model parameter optimization? 

2. The GDBC module treats the subjective bias between LC-MOS and LA-MOS as a latent variable with unknown parameters. How does it model and infer these unknown parameters of the subjective bias using the expectation-maximization algorithm?

3. How does the proposed method enforce the IQA model learned from noisy LC-MOS to approach the unbiased estimation of LA-MOS during training? Explain the key idea and technical details.

4. The paper claims the proposed GDBC method can reduce both the subjective bias and model bias. Can you analyze how it reduces these two types of bias separately?

5. Why does directly learning an IQA model from noisy LC-MOS tend to cause overfitting, as shown in the loss curves in Fig. 2? Explain the potential reasons behind this phenomenon.  

6. How does the paper design the gating mechanism in GDBC to avoid the overadjustment issue when updating the estimated subjective bias? Explain the key motivation and technical details.

7. The robustness validation shows consistent performance gains of GDBC under different bias rates and annotation numbers. What are the potential reasons that account for such robustness?

8. How does the proposed method differ from existing label screening methods for subjective bias calibration? What are their pros and cons respectively?

9. How does the proposed method differ from existing noisy label learning methods for model bias calibration? What are their pros and cons respectively?

10. The loss function plays an important role in analyzing the misleading effect of LC-MOS. If we change the loss function, will the conclusions still hold? How may the analysis be extended?
