# Thinking Clearly, Talking Fast: Concept-Guided Non-Autoregressive   Generation for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How to improve open-domain dialog systems to produce more coherent and controllable responses by effectively managing evolving concepts in a dialogue flow. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:1) Concept planning that selects contextually relevant concepts can facilitate coherent dialogues with smooth concept transitions. 2) Explicitly integrating multiple concepts into responses with a non-autoregressive generation strategy can better control the decoding process and improve response diversity.3) The proposed concept-guided non-autoregressive model (CG-nAR) with a multi-concept planning module and customized Insertion Transformer can achieve better performance in terms of both response quality and decoding efficiency compared to previous approaches.The experiments conducted aim to validate whether the proposed CG-nAR model can produce higher quality responses with better coherence and diversity while achieving faster inference speed by explicitly introducing multiple concepts into the responses in a non-autoregressive manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a concept-guided non-autoregressive approach (CG-nAR) for open-domain dialogue generation. This consists of a multi-concept planning module to select multiple relevant concepts for a coherent dialogue, and a customized Insertion Transformer to explicitly introduce the concepts into the response. 2. The multi-concept planning module can effectively manage concept transitions in a dialogue flow by attentively selecting concepts based on dialogue context and concept graph. This helps produce more coherent responses.3. The concept-guided non-autoregressive generation strategy ensures the selected concepts appear in the response, providing better control over response generation.4. Experiments on two datasets show CG-nAR generates higher quality responses compared to previous approaches, in terms of relevance, coherence and diversity. 5. CG-nAR significantly speeds up inference time compared to autoregressive models, due to parallel decoding.In summary, the main contributions are proposing a concept-guided non-autoregressive approach to generate more coherent and controllable responses for open-domain dialogues, while also improving inference efficiency. The key ideas are explicit multi-concept planning and guided non-autoregressive generation.
