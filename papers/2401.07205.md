# [Crafter: Facial Feature Crafting against Inversion-based Identity Theft   on Deep Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models are being used to process sensitive user data like facial images. Sending raw images to the cloud poses privacy risks from inversion attacks that reconstruct user images from features.
- Existing defences have drawbacks like being vulnerable to adaptive attacks, requiring known downstream tasks, or failing to protect semantic identity information.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Crafter, a facial feature crafting framework to protect identity information against inversion attacks. 
- Key ideas:
   - Manipulate features before sending to cloud rather than images, since features leak identity while allowing cloud tasks.  
   - Draw features close to a non-private prior distribution instead of away from original raw feature. This makes protected features act like poison samples to disrupt attacker's model updates.
   - Use a distributional distance metric (EMD) between reconstructed images and non-private images as privacy notion instead of just image distortion. This better captures identity information leakage.
- Formulate joint optimization problem with privacy loss (EMD) and utility loss (deviation from original feature). Solve with implicit differentiation.
- Shown to achieve good privacy-utility tradeoff and be robust to three kinds of adaptive attacks.

Main Contributions:
- Propose Crafter, a facial feature crafting framework that protects identity information against various inversion attacks while maintaining utility.
- Novel strategy of crafting features to be close to non-private prior instead of away from original. Shows superiority over adversarial game-based defences. 
- Use perceptual inversion indistinguishability, a distributional privacy metric for reconstruction attack scenario.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance against attacks and adaptive attacks with little utility loss. Easy to deploy without changing cloud models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Crafter, a facial feature crafting mechanism deployed at the edge that protects identity information from adaptive model inversion attacks by misleading the attacker's reconstruction to a non-private prior, while ensuring utility of downstream machine learning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing Crafter, a facial feature crafting mechanism against inversion attacks on deep learning models. It protects identity information from adaptive model inversion attacks while ensuring the ML tasks are properly carried out in the cloud.

2. Formulating the privacy of interest with perceptual inversion indistinguishability, a distributional distance from the attacker's prior to posterior view on the reconstructed images. It is shown to be a valid privacy notion for Crafter's defence on facial images.

3. Showing through analysis and experiments that Crafter achieves approximately optimal privacy-utility tradeoff. 

4. Crafter is open-sourced and easy to deploy as a plug-in to the edge-cloud computing framework, without any change in the backend models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Crafter, a robust and practical facial feature crafting approach against inversion attacks, with theoretical privacy guarantee.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Feature crafting - The paper proposes a facial feature crafting mechanism (Crafter) to protect identity information against inversion attacks on deep learning models.

- Perceptual inversion indistinguishability - A privacy notion proposed in the paper to quantify the identity information leakage, defined based on the Earth Mover's distance between the distribution of reconstructed images and non-private prior images. 

- Implicit function theorem - Used to resolve the optimization challenge in computing gradients with respect to protected features, by treating the best-response latent vector as an implicit function.

- Adaptive attacks - The paper explores and defends against three types of adaptive attacks that could target Crafter, including continuing optimization, using different generators, and averaging features.

- False security - The paper argues that defenses lacking evaluations against comprehensive adaptive attacks potentially give a false sense of security.

- Privacy-utility tradeoff - Balancing the privacy guarantees provided by Crafter against potential drops in utility/accuracy for downstream machine learning tasks.

In summary, the key focus is on constructing privacy-preserving facial feature representations that are robust even against adaptive reconstruction attacks, while retaining utility.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What threat model and privacy notion does Crafter aim to defend against? How is it different from previous works? How does Crafter exploit a non-private prior compared to previous adversarial game-based approaches?

2. What is the intuition behind Crafter's "get-close" approach? How does it theoretically differ from previous "stay-away" approaches in providing robustness against adaptive attacks? 

3. Explain the definitions and differences between perceptual inversion indistinguishability (PII), differential privacy (DP), and t-closeness. What privacy guarantee does Crafter provide?

4. Walk through the details of Crafter's optimization formulation in Eq. 8 and the rationale behind each component. Explain the challenges in optimizing this objective and how implicit differentiation is used to address that.

5. Analyze the three adaptive attacks explored in the paper. What assumptions do they make and which component of Crafter do they target? How does Crafter defend against them?

6. Compare and contrast the privacy-utility tradeoffs achieved by Crafter and the baselines under different attack settings. What explains Crafter's superior performance?

7. Examine Fig. 3 which shows the t-SNE visualization of latent vectors. Interpret the distributions and explain how it supports Crafter's robustness claim.

8. What is the role of the hyperparameter Î² in Crafter? How does it allow manipulating the privacy-utility tradeoff? Why is this not achieved in Crafter-z?

9. Analyze the validity and limitations of the proposed perceptual inversion indistinguishability (PII) metric. How does the proof bound the gap between empirical and true PII?   

10. What assumptions are made by Crafter about the defender's knowledge of the attacker? How can Crafter transfer across different attacker models in practice? What can be potential advanced adaptive attacks that Crafter does not cover?
