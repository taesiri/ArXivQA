# [Rieger, Schwabe, Suess-de Vries: The Sunny Beats of Resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0666)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can various periodicities in solar activity, from Rieger-type periods on the order of 100-300 days to the 11-year Schwabe cycle and longer-term cycles like Suess-de Vries, be explained in a unified way by resonant excitation of different phenomena by gravitational forcing from the planets?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Rieger-type periodicities arise from resonant excitation of magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline by two-planet spring tides. 2) The ~11 year beat period of these magneto-Rossby waves can synchronize the Schwabe cycle by modulating parameters like α or field storage capacity in a conventional α-Ω dynamo.3) The ~200 year Suess-de Vries cycle emerges from a beat between the ~22 year Hale cycle and ~19.9 year spin-orbit coupling related to motion around solar system barycenter. 4) Longer millennial cycles may arise from chaotic modulation of Suess-de Vries cycle, with some residual regularity related to planetary forcing.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that a range of solar cycles across timescales can be explained through resonant excitation of various processes by planetary gravitational forcing. The paper aims to present a unified conceptual model based on these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a comprehensive model to explain the various periodicities in solar activity (Rieger, Schwabe, Suess-de Vries cycles) using planetary tidal forces and resonances. 2. It shows how the dominant two-planet spring tides (Venus-Jupiter, Earth-Jupiter, Venus-Earth) can excite magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline that have Rieger-type periodicities. Detailed calculations are provided on the amplitudes of these waves.3. It explains how the beat period of the magneto-Rossby waves synchronized by the two-planet tides can modulate the alpha-effect in the tachocline, leading to the 11.07 yr Schwabe cycle via parametric resonance. 4. It demonstrates using a 2D alpha-Omega dynamo model how the 193-yr Suess-de Vries cycle can arise from the beat period between the 22.14-yr Hale cycle and the 19.86-yr period related to solar barycentric motion.5. It provides a unified framework to understand the coupling between tidal forces, magneto-Rossby waves, and the various periodicities in solar activity on different timescales. Overall, the paper builds a comprehensive resonant model of solar cycles based on planetary tidal forcing.In summary, the key contribution is the resonant model itself that links planetary tides, magneto-Rossby waves, and the major cycles of solar activity through parametric resonances and beat periods. The calculations and dynamo modeling support and validate this overarching conceptual model.
