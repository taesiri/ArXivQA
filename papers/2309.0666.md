# [Rieger, Schwabe, Suess-de Vries: The Sunny Beats of Resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0666)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can various periodicities in solar activity, from Rieger-type periods on the order of 100-300 days to the 11-year Schwabe cycle and longer-term cycles like Suess-de Vries, be explained in a unified way by resonant excitation of different phenomena by gravitational forcing from the planets?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Rieger-type periodicities arise from resonant excitation of magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline by two-planet spring tides. 2) The ~11 year beat period of these magneto-Rossby waves can synchronize the Schwabe cycle by modulating parameters like α or field storage capacity in a conventional α-Ω dynamo.3) The ~200 year Suess-de Vries cycle emerges from a beat between the ~22 year Hale cycle and ~19.9 year spin-orbit coupling related to motion around solar system barycenter. 4) Longer millennial cycles may arise from chaotic modulation of Suess-de Vries cycle, with some residual regularity related to planetary forcing.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that a range of solar cycles across timescales can be explained through resonant excitation of various processes by planetary gravitational forcing. The paper aims to present a unified conceptual model based on these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a comprehensive model to explain the various periodicities in solar activity (Rieger, Schwabe, Suess-de Vries cycles) using planetary tidal forces and resonances. 2. It shows how the dominant two-planet spring tides (Venus-Jupiter, Earth-Jupiter, Venus-Earth) can excite magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline that have Rieger-type periodicities. Detailed calculations are provided on the amplitudes of these waves.3. It explains how the beat period of the magneto-Rossby waves synchronized by the two-planet tides can modulate the alpha-effect in the tachocline, leading to the 11.07 yr Schwabe cycle via parametric resonance. 4. It demonstrates using a 2D alpha-Omega dynamo model how the 193-yr Suess-de Vries cycle can arise from the beat period between the 22.14-yr Hale cycle and the 19.86-yr period related to solar barycentric motion.5. It provides a unified framework to understand the coupling between tidal forces, magneto-Rossby waves, and the various periodicities in solar activity on different timescales. Overall, the paper builds a comprehensive resonant model of solar cycles based on planetary tidal forcing.In summary, the key contribution is the resonant model itself that links planetary tides, magneto-Rossby waves, and the major cycles of solar activity through parametric resonances and beat periods. The calculations and dynamo modeling support and validate this overarching conceptual model.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:The paper proposes a self-consistent model explaining the Rieger, Schwabe, and Suess-de Vries cycles of solar activity as resulting from resonant interactions between planetary tidal forces, magneto-Rossby waves, and the solar dynamo.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on solar cycles and planetary influences:- The idea of linking solar cycles to planetary tidal forces and resonances has a long history, going back over a century. This paper builds on that work by proposing specific mechanisms involving magneto-Rossby waves, modulation of the alpha effect, etc. However, the mechanisms are still quite hypothetical compared to dynamo models rooted more firmly in magnetohydrodynamics.- The paper takes a novel approach of trying to link phenomena on different timescales (Rieger periods, Schwabe cycle, Suess-de Vries cycle) in a unified framework involving harmonic beating between different periodic processes. This integrated perspective across timescales is unique.- Most prior work has focused on either short-term Rieger periodicities or long-term cycles. Attempting to connect the two, as this paper does, is innovative but the proposed links remain speculative. More modeling and data analysis are needed to substantiate the connections.- The paper relies heavily on assumed planetary tidal forcing and resonance effects as drivers of solar variability. This goes against the mainstream view in solar physics that attributes most solar cycle variation to internal dynamo dynamics, with planetary effects likely minor.- The analysis of specific periodicities in tidal forcing, orbital motions, etc. is quite detailed and may provide some constraints for further modeling. However, most dynamo modelers would likely see the tidal amplitudes as too small to significantly modulate the solar cycle.- Overall, the paper is intriguing and brings a fresh perspective, but remains conceptual. The ideas need more rigorous modeling and testing against data before gaining broad acceptance. The mechanisms linking different timescales are innovative but not yet firmly established.In summary, this paper proposes some novel ideas to unify different scales of solar variability using planetary forcing concepts. While thought-provoking, the ideas remain speculative compared to standard dynamo models. More evidence is needed to evaluate the proposed mechanisms involving magneto-Rossby waves, resonance effects, etc. If substantiated, the framework could provide new insights into solar dynamics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further investigation of the excitation of magneto-Rossby waves by two-planet spring tides, including more detailed computations of the resulting helicity and α-effect. The authors state this is an important next step to corroborate the proposed link between the tidally excited waves and dynamo synchronization.- More detailed parameter studies using the 2D α-Ω dynamo model to understand the emergence of the 193-year Suess-de Vries cycle from the beats between the 22-year Hale cycle and 19.86-year barycentric motion period. - Exploring whether including the 2318-year period related to motions of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune in the dynamo model can produce any noticeable signal on that longer timescale.- Further analysis of observational data like active longitudes to check for signatures of the tidally triggered magneto-Rossby waves.- Acquisition of additional independent solar cycle records, like more cosmogenic isotope data, to help resolve the ongoing debate about solar cycle clocking/phase stability.- Investigations of whether the excitation of magneto-Rossby waves could be suppressed in very weak field regimes like the Maunder minimum, leading to a loss of synchronization.- Exploring in more detail the possibility of stochastic resonance between dynamical chaos and residual regularity on millennial timescales.So in summary, the authors propose future work in several areas - from further theoretical modeling efforts, to analysis of different observations, to acquisition of new datasets - to help refine and test the tidal synchronization hypothesis.
