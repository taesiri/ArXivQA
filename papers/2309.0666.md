# [Rieger, Schwabe, Suess-de Vries: The Sunny Beats of Resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0666)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can various periodicities in solar activity, from Rieger-type periods on the order of 100-300 days to the 11-year Schwabe cycle and longer-term cycles like Suess-de Vries, be explained in a unified way by resonant excitation of different phenomena by gravitational forcing from the planets?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Rieger-type periodicities arise from resonant excitation of magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline by two-planet spring tides. 2) The ~11 year beat period of these magneto-Rossby waves can synchronize the Schwabe cycle by modulating parameters like α or field storage capacity in a conventional α-Ω dynamo.3) The ~200 year Suess-de Vries cycle emerges from a beat between the ~22 year Hale cycle and ~19.9 year spin-orbit coupling related to motion around solar system barycenter. 4) Longer millennial cycles may arise from chaotic modulation of Suess-de Vries cycle, with some residual regularity related to planetary forcing.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that a range of solar cycles across timescales can be explained through resonant excitation of various processes by planetary gravitational forcing. The paper aims to present a unified conceptual model based on these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a comprehensive model to explain the various periodicities in solar activity (Rieger, Schwabe, Suess-de Vries cycles) using planetary tidal forces and resonances. 2. It shows how the dominant two-planet spring tides (Venus-Jupiter, Earth-Jupiter, Venus-Earth) can excite magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline that have Rieger-type periodicities. Detailed calculations are provided on the amplitudes of these waves.3. It explains how the beat period of the magneto-Rossby waves synchronized by the two-planet tides can modulate the alpha-effect in the tachocline, leading to the 11.07 yr Schwabe cycle via parametric resonance. 4. It demonstrates using a 2D alpha-Omega dynamo model how the 193-yr Suess-de Vries cycle can arise from the beat period between the 22.14-yr Hale cycle and the 19.86-yr period related to solar barycentric motion.5. It provides a unified framework to understand the coupling between tidal forces, magneto-Rossby waves, and the various periodicities in solar activity on different timescales. Overall, the paper builds a comprehensive resonant model of solar cycles based on planetary tidal forcing.In summary, the key contribution is the resonant model itself that links planetary tides, magneto-Rossby waves, and the major cycles of solar activity through parametric resonances and beat periods. The calculations and dynamo modeling support and validate this overarching conceptual model.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:The paper proposes a self-consistent model explaining the Rieger, Schwabe, and Suess-de Vries cycles of solar activity as resulting from resonant interactions between planetary tidal forces, magneto-Rossby waves, and the solar dynamo.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on solar cycles and planetary influences:- The idea of linking solar cycles to planetary tidal forces and resonances has a long history, going back over a century. This paper builds on that work by proposing specific mechanisms involving magneto-Rossby waves, modulation of the alpha effect, etc. However, the mechanisms are still quite hypothetical compared to dynamo models rooted more firmly in magnetohydrodynamics.- The paper takes a novel approach of trying to link phenomena on different timescales (Rieger periods, Schwabe cycle, Suess-de Vries cycle) in a unified framework involving harmonic beating between different periodic processes. This integrated perspective across timescales is unique.- Most prior work has focused on either short-term Rieger periodicities or long-term cycles. Attempting to connect the two, as this paper does, is innovative but the proposed links remain speculative. More modeling and data analysis are needed to substantiate the connections.- The paper relies heavily on assumed planetary tidal forcing and resonance effects as drivers of solar variability. This goes against the mainstream view in solar physics that attributes most solar cycle variation to internal dynamo dynamics, with planetary effects likely minor.- The analysis of specific periodicities in tidal forcing, orbital motions, etc. is quite detailed and may provide some constraints for further modeling. However, most dynamo modelers would likely see the tidal amplitudes as too small to significantly modulate the solar cycle.- Overall, the paper is intriguing and brings a fresh perspective, but remains conceptual. The ideas need more rigorous modeling and testing against data before gaining broad acceptance. The mechanisms linking different timescales are innovative but not yet firmly established.In summary, this paper proposes some novel ideas to unify different scales of solar variability using planetary forcing concepts. While thought-provoking, the ideas remain speculative compared to standard dynamo models. More evidence is needed to evaluate the proposed mechanisms involving magneto-Rossby waves, resonance effects, etc. If substantiated, the framework could provide new insights into solar dynamics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further investigation of the excitation of magneto-Rossby waves by two-planet spring tides, including more detailed computations of the resulting helicity and α-effect. The authors state this is an important next step to corroborate the proposed link between the tidally excited waves and dynamo synchronization.- More detailed parameter studies using the 2D α-Ω dynamo model to understand the emergence of the 193-year Suess-de Vries cycle from the beats between the 22-year Hale cycle and 19.86-year barycentric motion period. - Exploring whether including the 2318-year period related to motions of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune in the dynamo model can produce any noticeable signal on that longer timescale.- Further analysis of observational data like active longitudes to check for signatures of the tidally triggered magneto-Rossby waves.- Acquisition of additional independent solar cycle records, like more cosmogenic isotope data, to help resolve the ongoing debate about solar cycle clocking/phase stability.- Investigations of whether the excitation of magneto-Rossby waves could be suppressed in very weak field regimes like the Maunder minimum, leading to a loss of synchronization.- Exploring in more detail the possibility of stochastic resonance between dynamical chaos and residual regularity on millennial timescales.So in summary, the authors propose future work in several areas - from further theoretical modeling efforts, to analysis of different observations, to acquisition of new datasets - to help refine and test the tidal synchronization hypothesis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a self-consistent explanation of Rieger-type periodicities, the Schwabe cycle, and the Suess-de Vries cycle in terms of resonances of various wave phenomena with gravitational forces exerted by the orbiting planets. Starting with Rieger-type timescales, the paper shows that two-planet spring tides are able to excite magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline which can be linked to Rieger periodicities. The beat period of these magneto-Rossby waves is suggested to synchronize the Schwabe cycle by periodically changing the field storage capacity or alpha-effect in the tachocline. The Suess-de Vries cycle is explained as a beat between the Hale cycle and a spin-orbit coupling related to the motion of the Sun around the barycenter. Overall, the paper aims to provide a unified model where planetary tidal forces resonate with intrinsic solar dynamics on different timescales to produce observed periodicities in solar activity.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes an explanation for various periodicities in solar activity in terms of planetary gravitational influences. It focuses on linking the shortest Rieger-type timescales of around 100-300 days to resonant excitation of magneto-Rossby waves in the tachocline by the dominant tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter. Calculations indicate these spring tide periods are able to excite magneto-Rossby waves with amplitudes potentially up to meters per second. The paper argues the beat periods of these magneto-Rossby waves can synchronize the 11-year Schwabe cycle by periodically modulating the alpha-effect or field storage capacity. For longer timescales, the paper shows the 193-year Suess-de Vries cycle can emerge as a beat between the 22-year Hale cycle and the 19.86-year periodic motion of the Sun around the barycenter. Finally, the paper speculates on how millennial variations like Eddy and Hallstatt cycles may arise through chaotic breakdowns of the Suess-de Vries cycle, while retaining some residual regularity related to the 2300-year cycle of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Overall, the paper aims to provide a self-consistent model linking various solar periodicities to resonant interactions with planetary tidal forces and motions.In summary, this paper proposes planetary gravitational forces can excite magneto-Rossby waves on Rieger timescales that synchronize the Schwabe cycle through beat periods modulating the alpha-effect. It also shows longer Suess-de Vries and millennial cycles may emerge from interactions between short planetary periods and intrinsic solar dynamo timescales. The goal is a comprehensive model relating various periodic solar variations to specific resonant planetary forcings.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a self-consistent explanation for various periodicities in solar activity, including Rieger-type periods, the Schwabe cycle, and the Suess-de Vries cycle, based on resonances of different wave phenomena in the Sun with gravitational forces exerted by the orbiting planets.  The key aspects are:- Rieger-type periods of 100-300 days are explained as magneto-Rossby waves excited in the tachocline by the spring tides of Venus-Jupiter, Earth-Jupiter and Venus-Earth. Calculations show these waves can reach amplitudes up to tens of m/s.- The 11.07-year Schwabe cycle results from the nonlinear beat interaction of the magneto-Rossby waves, which modulates the alpha-effect and synchronizes the dynamo by parametric resonance. - The 200-year Suess-de Vries cycle emerges as a beat between the 22.14-year Hale cycle and the 19.86-year period related to the Sun's motion around the solar system barycenter. This is demonstrated using a 2D alpha-Omega dynamo model.In summary, the paper links different periodic solar variabilities to resonant interactions between dynamical processes inside the Sun and gravitational forcing by the planets. Shorter cycles result from direct resonance, while longer cycles arise as beats between shorter cycles.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading, the main problem this paper is addressing is explaining the various periodicities in solar activity, including the 11-year Schwabe cycle, the 200-year Suess-de Vries cycle, and longer-term variabilities like the Hallstatt cycle, in a coherent way using planetary influences on the solar dynamo. Specifically, some key issues and questions the paper seems to be focused on are:- How can the tidal forces of the planets, which are very small, have any significant influence on solar dynamo processes and activity? The paper proposes magneto-Rossby waves triggered resonantly by planetary spring tides as a mechanism to channel tidal energy.- How to explain the 11.07-year periodicity of the Schwabe cycle, when there is no corresponding sharp peak in the tidal forces? The paper proposes a resonance between magneto-Rossby waves triggered by certain planetary spring tides and the underlying solar dynamo.- How to explain longer periodicities like the Suess-de Vries cycle, again without correspondingly long periods in the tidal forces? The paper proposes these longer cycles emerge through beat frequencies between the Schwabe cycle and shorter periods related to solar spin-orbit coupling.- More broadly, how to provide a coherent picture explaining the multitude of observed solar periodicities through planetary tidal forcing and resonant interactions of waves, oscillations and dynamo processes inside the Sun.So in summary, the key focus seems to be on providing a unified physical explanation for the various periodicities in solar activity by linking them to planetary tidal forces through resonant wave interactions and beat frequencies between different solar processes. A core part of this is addressing how very small tidal forces can have significant impacts on the solar dynamo.
