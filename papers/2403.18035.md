# [Bidirectional Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Diffusion models can generate high-quality images by iteratively adding and removing noise. However, the iterative sampling process is slow. Recently, consistency models were proposed to accelerate sampling by directly estimating the integral of the probability flow ODE. But they lack native support for inverting images, a key capability for downstream tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces the Bidirectional Consistency Model (BCM) which unifies image generation and inversion within a single framework. BCM trains a neural network to traverse along the probability flow ODE in both forward and backward directions, enabling both sampling and inversion tasks. 

Key Contributions:
- BCM can generate images using just 1 function evaluation while allowing more steps to enhance quality. It matches or exceeds previous diffusion models using 10-100x fewer steps.
- BCM effectively inverts images for reconstruction and downstream tasks using significantly fewer steps than prior ODE-based approaches.
- Leveraging bidirectional consistency, BCM proposes new sampling schemes like "zigzag sampling" to improve sample quality while maintaining determinism.
- BCM demonstrates strong performance on tasks like interpolation between real images, inpainting, blind image restoration, and defending against black-box adversarial attacks.

In summary, the key innovation is establishing bidirectional consistency along the probability flow ODE to simultaneously enable fast sampling and inversion within a single model. This unlocks new capabilities and applications for diffusion-based generative models.
