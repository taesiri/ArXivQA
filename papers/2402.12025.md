# [Speech Translation with Speech Foundation Models and Large Language   Models: What is There and What is Missing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Recent works have combined Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) into single models for speech translation (ST), demonstrating promising results. 
- However, different contemporaneous works have proposed varied architectures and training strategies, making comparisons difficult. There is a need to systematically analyze existing solutions to identify commonalities, differences, lessons learned, and future directions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper surveys 9 recent works on SFM+LLM models for ST and analyzes them along two dimensions: architectural building blocks and training/evaluation settings. 
- A unified abstraction comprising 5 common components is identified: SFM, Length Adapter, Modality Adapter, Prompt-Speech Mixer, and LLM. Similarities and differences in the choice of each component are highlighted.  
- Great variability is found in terms of training data, tasks, language pairs, evaluation metrics, and techniques for finetuning the SFMs and LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- The paper provides a structured analysis of existing works, establishing a unified framework to interpret recent progress.
- It underscores the lack of standardized training and evaluation protocols, advocating for public benchmarks to enable fair comparisons.
- It delineates multiple open challenges and recommendations for advancing research on SFM+LLM solutions for ST, including thorough assessments of their capabilities compared to traditional methods.

In summary, this is a comprehensive survey analyzing recent works on combining SFMs and LLMs for ST. By identifying common abstractions and highlighting variability in experimental settings, it organizes current knowledge and outlines recommendations to systematically advance research in this emerging field.
