# [Speech Translation with Speech Foundation Models and Large Language   Models: What is There and What is Missing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Recent works have combined Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) into single models for speech translation (ST), demonstrating promising results. 
- However, different contemporaneous works have proposed varied architectures and training strategies, making comparisons difficult. There is a need to systematically analyze existing solutions to identify commonalities, differences, lessons learned, and future directions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper surveys 9 recent works on SFM+LLM models for ST and analyzes them along two dimensions: architectural building blocks and training/evaluation settings. 
- A unified abstraction comprising 5 common components is identified: SFM, Length Adapter, Modality Adapter, Prompt-Speech Mixer, and LLM. Similarities and differences in the choice of each component are highlighted.  
- Great variability is found in terms of training data, tasks, language pairs, evaluation metrics, and techniques for finetuning the SFMs and LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- The paper provides a structured analysis of existing works, establishing a unified framework to interpret recent progress.
- It underscores the lack of standardized training and evaluation protocols, advocating for public benchmarks to enable fair comparisons.
- It delineates multiple open challenges and recommendations for advancing research on SFM+LLM solutions for ST, including thorough assessments of their capabilities compared to traditional methods.

In summary, this is a comprehensive survey analyzing recent works on combining SFMs and LLMs for ST. By identifying common abstractions and highlighting variability in experimental settings, it organizes current knowledge and outlines recommendations to systematically advance research in this emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper surveys recent works on combining speech foundation models and large language models into single models for speech translation, analyzes their architectures and training strategies, and advocates for standardized training/evaluation recipes to enable fair comparisons and measure actual progress.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a systematic analysis and survey of recent work on combining speech foundation models (SFMs) and large language models (LLMs) for speech translation. Its main contributions are:

1) Identifying the common architectural building blocks across existing SFM+LLM models for speech translation, including the speech foundation model, length adapter, modality adapter, prompt-speech mixer, and large language model. 

2) Reviewing and comparing the training data, tasks, evaluation data, and other experimental settings used in current research. This highlights the lack of standardized training recipes and evaluations which hinders direct comparison between approaches.

3) Underscoring open issues that need further investigation to better understand the potential of SFM+LLM solutions for speech translation, such as comparisons with standard methods, assessment of in-context learning abilities, and the use of open standard training settings to enable fair benchmarking.

In summary, the paper organizes and surveys the emerging field of speech translation with combined speech and language models, while pointing out open challenges and recommendations for future work towards improved understanding and evaluation of these models. The analysis provides a unified view of SFM+LLM solutions and articulates directions for more grounded progress.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a common abstraction for SFM+LLM architectures with 5 key building blocks. Could you elaborate on the role and necessity of each building block? What variations have been proposed in the literature for some of them?

2) The paper highlights the lack of standardized training settings as an obstacle to fair comparisons across methods. In your view, what would be suitable public benchmark datasets and tasks to establish an open standard training recipe?

3) The paper advocates the adoption of metrics other than BLEU to assess translation quality in this setting. What are some good candidate semantic metrics to complement BLEU scores in the evaluation?

4) The paper suggests the Length Adapter is important to control computational costs. Beyond downstream performance, how should the efficiency of different Length Adapters solutions be analyzed? What metrics could be used?

5) The role of finetuning Speech Foundation Models vs Large Language Models is discussed but not investigated in depth. What factors determine the need for finetuning each component? What insights are needed regarding the quantity of finetuning data?

6) The benefits of supporting multiple translation language pairs are unclear. Does adding more language pairs improve model generalization? Could it enable positive transfer learning between similar languages? How could this be investigated?  

7) What are some key aspects that need to be studied regarding the integration of Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models to assess the transfer of inherent Large Language Model capabilities like in-context learning?

8) What types of tailored test suites and fine-grained comparisons are needed to assess strengths vs weaknesses of SFM+LLM solutions against standard speech translation approaches?

9) The paper does not discuss ethical implications and considerations. What aspects of fairness, inclusiveness, bias etc should be analyzed for SFM+LLM solutions and compared to traditional methods?

10) The inference efficiency is mentioned as an important concern for large models. What methods for model compression, pruning and efficient decoding could help address this issue for SFM+LLM speech translation?
