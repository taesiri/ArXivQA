# [Generative Pretrained Hierarchical Transformer for Time Series   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing time series forecasting methods have two key limitations: 
1) They rely on a single dataset for training, limiting the model's generalizability due to the restricted scale and variability of the training data.  
2) They follow a one-step generation schema which requires a customized forecasting head for each forecast horizon, overlooking temporal dependencies in the predictions.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel generative pretrained hierarchical transformer architecture called GPHT to address these limitations. GPHT has two key aspects:

1) Pretraining on a mixed dataset comprising various real-world time series datasets covering diverse data scenarios. This significantly expands the scale and variability of training data to uncover commonalities across time series and improve transferability.

2) An auto-regressive forecasting approach under the channel-independent assumption to explicitly model temporal dependencies in the predicted timeseries without needing customized forecast heads. This enables forecasting at arbitrary horizons with a single model.

GPHT employs a hierarchical transformer encoder architecture with iterative residual learning across stages to capture multi-scale patterns and temporal dependencies. The pretraining task is formulated as a standard language modeling objective to predict the next token in a timeseries patch.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of constructing a large, diverse mixed dataset by combining multiple real-world TS datasets for pretraining
- Introduce GPHT - a novel hierarchical transformer architecture that forecasts auto-regressively after pretraining on the mixed dataset
- Extensive experiments comparing GPHT against state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised baselines. GPHT shows consistent improvements in long-term forecasting across various fine-tuning scenarios.
- Analysis provides support for the effectiveness of pretraining on mixed data and the architectural designs of GPHT.

In summary, the paper presents a method for creating better generalizable timeseries forecasting models by pretraining on diverse mixed data at scale along with an appropriately designed architecture.
