# [MirrorDiffusion: Stabilizing Diffusion Process in Zero-shot Image   Translation by Prompts Redescription and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent text-to-image diffusion models like DDPM can generate realistic images given text prompts. However, they struggle with image-to-image translation tasks, especially zero-shot translation without target images.  
- During diffusion and inversion, errors accumulate causing the reconstructed image to deviate from the source image (displacement effect). This affects translation accuracy.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose MirrorDiffusion - a prompt redescription strategy to align source and reconstructed images to realize a "mirror effect".
- Introduce a prompt redescription loss to minimize the difference between latent codes during inversion and reconstruction. This realigns prompts and latents at each step.
- Compute domain gap between source and target prompts using CLIP. Edit source prompt with target direction for sampling latents.
- Decoder converts aligned latent codes into translated image.

Main Contributions:
- Propose prompt redescription mechanism to address displacement in diffusion inversion and enable reliable reconstruction.
- Align latent codes with text prompts during diffusion for consistency in zero-shot image translation. 
- Experiments show MirrorDiffusion outperforms recent diffusion models on zero-shot benchmarks and tasks like glasses removal/adding, gender swap, etc.
- The proposed approach demonstrates superior stability. The prompt rewrite module is shown to improve consistency in other diffusion models like DDIM and Pix2Pix-Zero.

In summary, MirrorDiffusion introduces a prompt redescription strategy to align source and reconstructed images in diffusion models. This enables accurate zero-shot image translation with stability. Both qualitative and quantitative results showcase the effectiveness of the approach over state-of-the-arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

To address the displacement effect in diffusion-based image translation, this paper proposes a prompt redescription mechanism called MirrorDiffusion to align latent codes and text prompts during diffusion inversion, achieving superior zero-shot image translation with structure consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a prompt redescription mechanism to address the displacement problem of image reconstruction in diffusion models. Specifically:

1) A prompt redescription strategy is proposed to align the text prompts with latent code at each time step of the diffusion inversion process. This achieves a reliable and effective image reconstruction that keeps structure consistency with the source image. 

2) Based on the revised diffusion inversion with prompt redescription, the paper further aligns the latent code with the text prompt during the diffusion process to ensure consistency in zero-shot image translation. 

3) Extensive experiments show that the proposed method called MirrorDiffusion achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion models on zero-shot image translation benchmarks in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. It demonstrates clear advantages in model stability.

In summary, the key contribution is using prompt redescription to stabilize the diffusion process and enable high-quality zero-shot image translation with structure consistency.

The paper proposes a "prompt redescription strategy" called MirrorDiffusion to stabilize the diffusion process for zero-shot image-to-image translation. Key ideas include addressing the "displacement effect" in diffusion models and realizing a "mirror effect" between the source and reconstructed images to improve structure consistency. The method aligns text prompts and latent codes during the DDIM inversion process. Evaluations demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art on zero-shot translation benchmarks. So keywords like "diffusion process", "image translation", "zero-shot", "displacement effect", "prompt redescription", "mirror effect", etc. seem most relevant to summarizing the key focus of this work.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key issue that the proposed MirrorDiffusion method aims to address in diffusion-based image translation models? Why is this issue important to solve for high-quality image translation?

2. How does the proposed prompt redescription mechanism align the text prompts with latent code at each diffusion timestep to pursue structure-preserving reconstruction? Explain the differences from previous alignment strategies.  

3. What is the motivation behind using CLIP to compute the domain gap between source and target domains? How does this enable zero-shot image translation in MirrorDiffusion? 

4. Explain the differences in how latent codes are handled during diffusion and inversion in MirrorDiffusion compared to previous DDIM methods. How does this reduce accumulation of errors?

5. The paper mentions "displacement effect" during typical diffusion model inversion. Elaborate what causes this effect and how prompt redescription addresses it.  

6. How is the prompt redescription loss formulated? Walk through the key variables and objectives of this loss function.  

7. What modifications need to be made to the sampling equations in DDIM inversion with the proposed prompt redescription strategy? Explain the updated sampling process.

8. Compare and contrast the attention maps with and without the rewrite loss during reconstruction. What inferences can be made about the impact of this loss?

9. Could the proposed method be extended to other conditional diffusion models beyond text-to-image generation? What challenges need to be addressed?

10. The method relies on a frozen pretrained diffusion model. How could end-to-end joint training be explored to further improve translation quality? What difficulties need to be overcome?
