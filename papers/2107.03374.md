# [Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How capable are large language models fine-tuned on code (Codex models) at generating standalone Python functions from natural language docstrings, and what are the limitations and broader impacts of deploying such systems?The key hypotheses appear to be:1. Large language models like GPT-3 can be effectively fine-tuned on code to produce functional Python code from docstrings, in contrast to their poor performance without code fine-tuning.2. Performance on this task, as measured by pass rates on a new dataset of hand-written programming problems, will improve smoothly with model size. 3. Additional fine-tuning on curated datasets of standalone functions can further improve capabilities on this task.4. Generating multiple samples and picking the best one is an effective strategy for producing working solutions, even without access to unit tests.5. While powerful, these Codex models have important limitations in their ability to synthesize complex, multi-operation programs from higher-level specifications.6. Broader deployment of such systems has important considerations around potential misuse, bias, economic impacts, environmental costs, and other areas explored in the paper.In summary, the central goal is benchmarking Codex models on program synthesis and highlighting their current capabilities and limitations, in order to better understand the potential impacts of large language models specialized for code generation.

Can the models not only generate code from docstrings, but also generate docstrings from code?5. What are the limitations of these code generation models, especially in terms of handling long and complex specifications?6. What are the broader impacts and potential risks associated with deploying powerful code generation models?The key hypothesis seems to be that large language models like GPT can be effectively fine-tuned on code to produce models (Codex) that are capable of generating functionally correct Python code from natural language descriptions, and that this capability improves with scale.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be the introduction and evaluation of Codex, a GPT language model fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub to generate Python code. The key findings include:- Codex can generate simple Python programs from docstrings, solving 28.8% of programming problems in a new evaluation dataset called HumanEval. This significantly outperforms regular GPT models like GPT-3.- Repeated sampling from Codex and picking the best sample is an effective strategy, allowing it to solve 70.2% of problems within 100 samples per problem. The best sample can be identified by selecting the one that passes unit tests or has highest log probability.- Codex models exhibit some limitations, like difficulty handling long chains of operations in docstrings and binding operations to variables. Performance degrades exponentially as the number of chained components in the docstring increases.- Additional supervised fine-tuning on standalone Python functions improves Codex's performance further, with the resulting Codex-S model solving 37.7% of problems with a single sample.- The paper also discusses broader impacts of deploying powerful code generation models, covering safety, security, environmental, economic and legal considerations.In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that large language models like GPT can be effectively fine-tuned on code to produce functional Python programs from natural language specifications, as measured by a new benchmark based on unit testing. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the capabilities and limitations of these Codex models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of large language models trained on code:- The key contribution of this paper is introducing Codex, a series of GPT models fine-tuned on public code from GitHub to generate Python code. This builds on previous work training large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-Neo on mixed text and code data, showing the benefits of specializing a model for code generation through fine-tuning.- The paper thoroughly evaluates Codex models using a new metric, pass@k, which measures how often the model can generate at least one functionally correct code sample out of k samples for a given prompt. This provides a more realistic metric compared to exact match accuracy, as there are many possible correct solutions for a coding problem.- The authors introduce a new hand-written evaluation dataset, HumanEval, to benchmark Codex's ability to solve simple coding problems. This adds to existing code generation datasets like APPS that focus more on competitive programming challenges. HumanEval may be more representative of basic coding skills.- For model training, the paper doesn't propose new techniques beyond standard transformer fine-tuning, but provides useful insights on model scaling, the relationship between sample temperature and pass@k, and the benefits of further fine-tuning on clean data.- The analysis on societal impacts and limitations is quite comprehensive. The paper is one of the first detailed studies on the potential misuse of code generation models and the alignment challenges that arise from maximizing a next-token prediction objective.Overall, this paper significantly advances code generation capabilities over prior work and provides a very thorough evaluation methodology and analysis. The HumanEval benchmark and insights on model scaling, sampling, and societal impacts will likely inspire future work in this burgeoning field.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research in code generation and programming language models:- This paper introduces Codex, a large language model fine-tuned on GitHub code to generate Python functions from docstrings. It builds on previous work showing language model capabilities for code, like GPT-3 and GPT-Neo, but shows much stronger performance by specializing the model training on code.- The paper focuses on standalone Python function synthesis from docstrings and evaluates correctness using unit tests. This is different from a lot of prior work that looks at code generation in narrow domains like FlashFill or uses match-based metrics like BLEU instead of functional correctness. The HumanEval benchmark reflects more real-world programming tasks.- The technique of sampling multiple candidates and picking the best match to reference behavior is similar to past techniques in genetic programming and neural program synthesis. The paper shows this can be adapted to scale up large language models, greatly improving the chances of generating one functionally correct program.- Compared to specialized models like CodeBERT and PyMT5 that incorporate syntax trees or translate between problem statements, prompt and docstring, Codex just uses the standard language modeling approach. So it's interesting that Codex achieves strong results without explicit coding-specific architecture.- The analysis of model limitations is unique, investigating performance degradation on long, complex specifications. This helps characterize capabilities and provides concrete challenges for future improvement.- The scale of the model training is unprecedented, using hundreds of GB of Python code from GitHub to specialize a 12B parameter model. Most prior work either uses much smaller datasets or does not specialize on code.Overall, Codex represents a significant advance in language model capabilities for code while analyzing limitations and proposing evaluation methods that will drive further progress. The scale of model training and focus on standalone functionality also differentiates it from related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Measuring the economic value of generating faster and better code with Codex models. This includes tracking impacts of tools built with Codex and whether they enable new software that was not possible before. - Studying changes in code documentation and testing practices when using Codex. The models may propagate subtle errors or lead to over-reliance on them for writing tests.- Researching the impact of code generation on productivity, quality of life, and wages of programmers. Most current studies use simulated tasks, but as Codex is deployed, real-world experiments could be conducted. - Measuring Codex's ability to reduce barriers to entry in software engineering, such as how it influences education and career paths of new programmers.- Updating views on the potential for AI to substitute for high-skill human roles, given Codex's capabilities. As the models improve, their effects could be substantial.- Further alignment research to make the models more helpful, correct bugs, and follow instructions. Techniques could include prompt engineering, dataset curation, and reinforcement learning.- Developing better metrics to evaluate model alignment beyond just input-output behavior. This can aid safety for more general tasks.- Studying model performance on higher-level and more complex specifications, like concurrency, parallelism, and system requirements. The current benchmarks use constrained tasks.- Continued monitoring of misuse of Codex for malware, phishing, etc. Though not a huge risk now, more advanced models may enable new threats.- Analysis of the differential impacts of Codex on programming languages, software packages, and demographic groups of programmers. There may be uneven effects.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several directions for future research:- Further study of the limitations and potential broader impacts of code generation models. They suggest more research into model alignment, mitigating bias and representation issues, minimizing environmental impact, and legal implications. - Exploring ways to improve model alignment, such as prompt engineering, filtering the training data, fine-tuning on high-quality code, and reinforcement learning from human feedback.- Developing better metrics for evaluating model alignment beyond just input-output behavior. The authors suggest "transparency tools" could help determine if a model is aligned even if its outputs seem fine.- Further analysis of the economic and labor impacts of code generation models as capabilities improve. The authors recommend studying effects on productivity, wages, barriers to entry, and impacts across demographic groups.- More security analysis as models become more capable, such as studies on polymorphic malware, model poisoning, and frequency of insecure code generation.- Applying the proposed framework for evaluating model capabilities based on complexity and abstraction level of specifications.- Developing more principled benchmarks and grand challenge problems for code synthesis to enable scientifically rigorous comparisons.In summary, the authors highlight the need for interdisciplinary research to steer code generation towards beneficial outcomes across dimensions like safety, security, fairness, economics, and environmental impact.
