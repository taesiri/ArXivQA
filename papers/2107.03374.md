# [Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can a large language model (Codex) be trained to generate functionally correct Python code from natural language specifications?

Specifically, the authors investigate whether fine-tuning GPT models on publicly available code from GitHub can produce a model capable of solving programming problems given natural language prompts. They evaluate the model's ability to generate standalone Python functions from docstrings that pass unit tests.

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1. Fine-tuning a large pre-trained language model like GPT on code will allow it to generate syntactically valid Python code. 

2. This code generation model (Codex) will be able to produce functionally correct code that passes test cases, when conditioned on natural language prompts specifying the desired function.

3. Performance on generating correct code will improve with increased model scale and task-specific fine-tuning.

4. Sampling multiple solutions and picking the best one can further boost the rate of generating correct code.

So in summary, the central research question is whether large language models can learn to generate functionally correct code from natural language prompts when trained on code, and if so, how well.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is introducing Codex, a large language model fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub, and studying its capabilities for generating Python code from natural language descriptions. Specifically:

- They introduce Codex, a GPT model fine-tuned on 159 GB of Python code from GitHub. 

- They evaluate Codex on a new benchmark called HumanEval, consisting of 164 hand-written Python programming problems with unit tests. Codex is able to solve 28.8% of the problems with a single sample, compared to GPT-3 which solves 0%.

- They show that generating multiple samples from Codex and picking the top ranked one can significantly boost performance. Using this approach, Codex solves 44.5% of the problems by picking the sample with highest log probability. It solves 77.5% of problems by picking the sample that actually passes the unit tests.

- They analyze the limitations of Codex, finding it struggles with long specifications and binding operations to variables. They also discuss potential broader impacts like over-reliance, misalignment, bias, and security implications.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be the introduction and analysis of Codex, including benchmarking it on a new Python programming task suite, investigating its limitations, and discussing potential societal impacts. The ability to generate code from natural language descriptions could be useful for applications like auto-complete in IDEs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of evaluating large language models trained on code:

- The paper introduces a new dataset called HumanEval for evaluating functional correctness of code generation models. This complements existing datasets like APPS that also focus on correctness but use competitive programming problems. Having multiple diverse datasets helps better understand model capabilities.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates different sampling strategies and selection heuristics for generating functional code. This analysis of how different sampling temperatures and ranking methods impact correctness rates provides useful insights beyond just reporting aggregate metrics. 

- The paper conducts side-by-side comparisons to previous models like GPT-Neo and GPT-J on the HumanEval and APPS datasets. Quantitatively benchmarking against prior work contextualizes the capabilities of Codex.

- The paper examines model performance on synthetically generated compositional tasks to analyze its limitations in handling long specifications. This probes systemic issues beyond performance on existing datasets.

- The paper includes extensive analysis on societal impacts, limitations, and risks associated with deploying code generation models. Most prior work has focused narrowly on benchmarks, so this broader perspective is valuable.

- One limitation is that the paper evaluates exclusively on Python code generation. Other recent work has explored code generation capabilities in languages like Java which could reveal different strengths and weaknesses.

Overall, I think the paper makes excellent contributions in evaluation methodology, thorough benchmarking, and discussion of broader impacts. The combination of rigorous empirical analysis and critical perspective compares favorably to a lot of existing research in this space.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Codex, a GPT language model fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub, and studies its Python code-writing capabilities. The authors create a new dataset called HumanEval to evaluate the ability of models to generate standalone Python functions from docstrings. On this dataset, Codex solves significantly more problems than GPT-3 and GPT-J, with the 12B parameter version solving 28.8% of the problems with one sample per task. The authors also fine-tune Codex on curated datasets of high quality standalone functions to create Codex-S, which further improves performance to 37.7% on one sample evaluation. By generating and evaluating multiple samples, the authors are able to achieve even higher pass rates. For example, Codex-S passes 77.5% of tasks if allowed 100 samples per task and picking the one that passes tests. The authors discuss the limitations of Codex, including difficulty with long chains of operations and binding operations to variables in the prompt. Finally, the paper covers potential positive and negative societal impacts of deploying powerful generative models of code.

In summary, this paper introduces and benchmarks Codex, a GPT model fine-tuned on code that displays significantly stronger Python programming abilities compared to GPT-3 and GPT-J. The authors use a new dataset to evaluate functional correctness rather than simple text matching, and find that Codex can generate complete Python functions from natural language prompts. The authors also highlight societal considerations related to deploying such systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces Codex, a large language model fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub to generate Python code from natural language descriptions. The key method involves pre-training a GPT model on a large corpus of Python code from GitHub, then fine-tuning it on the task of generating Python function bodies from docstrings. 

To evaluate Codex, the authors create a dataset of 164 hand-written Python programming problems with unit tests. They measure the percentage of problems solved correctly by generating multiple code samples for each problem and checking if any pass the tests. Without any fine-tuning, GPT-3 solves 0% of the problems, while fine-tuning yields a 12B parameter Codex model that solves 28.8% of problems in one sample. By generating 100 samples per problem and picking the best, Codex solves up to 70% of problems. The authors also fine-tune Codex further on curated datasets of correct standalone functions, obtaining an improved 37.7% pass rate with one sample from the 12B parameter Codex-S model.

In summary, the key method is large-scale pre-training of a GPT model on GitHub Python code, followed by task-specific fine-tuning and generating multiple samples to maximize the chances of producing a correct solution. The models are evaluated on a new hand-written programming problem dataset with unit tests.
