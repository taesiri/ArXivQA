# StructureFlow: Image Inpainting via Structure-aware Appearance Flow

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can an image inpainting model generate both meaningful structures and realistic textures for missing image regions? The key points are:- Most existing inpainting methods struggle to balance structure reconstruction and texture generation. They may fail to generate reasonable structures or restore fine details. - The authors propose a two-stage model called StructureFlow to address this issue. It splits inpainting into structure reconstruction and texture generation.- In stage 1, a structure reconstructor uses edge-preserved smooth images to complete missing structures. This focuses on global structure without texture distractions. - In stage 2, a texture generator uses appearance flow to sample features from existing regions based on the reconstructed structure. This establishes correlations for texture generation.- Experiments show the model can generate competitive qualitative and quantitative results compared to prior art on benchmark datasets.In summary, the main hypothesis is that separating structure reconstruction and texture generation, using edge-preserved smooth images and appearance flow, can allow an inpainting model to generate both meaningful structures and realistic textures for corrupted images. The paper aims to demonstrate this approach can achieve improved inpainting results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a two-stage image inpainting method called StructureFlow. The key contributions are:- A structure reconstructor is proposed to generate edge-preserved smooth images as global structure guidance. This allows the model to focus on recovering overall structures without being disturbed by fine textures.- Appearance flow is introduced in the texture generator to establish long-term correlations between missing and existing regions. This helps generate realistic textures by sampling features from visually similar areas. Gaussian sampling and a sampling correctness loss are used to improve appearance flow.- Experiments show the method achieves competitive quantitative results and generates more realistic inpainting results compared to prior arts, especially for images with distinct structures like faces and buildings. - Ablation studies validate the effects of the proposed structure guidance and appearance flow. The method can also be applied for object removal and image editing tasks.In summary, the main contribution is a two-stage inpainting approach that disentangles structure reconstruction and texture generation for improved results. The use of edge-preserved smooth images and appearance flow are key to separately recovering structures and textures.
