# StructureFlow: Image Inpainting via Structure-aware Appearance Flow

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can an image inpainting model generate both meaningful structures and realistic textures for missing image regions? The key points are:- Most existing inpainting methods struggle to balance structure reconstruction and texture generation. They may fail to generate reasonable structures or restore fine details. - The authors propose a two-stage model called StructureFlow to address this issue. It splits inpainting into structure reconstruction and texture generation.- In stage 1, a structure reconstructor uses edge-preserved smooth images to complete missing structures. This focuses on global structure without texture distractions. - In stage 2, a texture generator uses appearance flow to sample features from existing regions based on the reconstructed structure. This establishes correlations for texture generation.- Experiments show the model can generate competitive qualitative and quantitative results compared to prior art on benchmark datasets.In summary, the main hypothesis is that separating structure reconstruction and texture generation, using edge-preserved smooth images and appearance flow, can allow an inpainting model to generate both meaningful structures and realistic textures for corrupted images. The paper aims to demonstrate this approach can achieve improved inpainting results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a two-stage image inpainting method called StructureFlow. The key contributions are:- A structure reconstructor is proposed to generate edge-preserved smooth images as global structure guidance. This allows the model to focus on recovering overall structures without being disturbed by fine textures.- Appearance flow is introduced in the texture generator to establish long-term correlations between missing and existing regions. This helps generate realistic textures by sampling features from visually similar areas. Gaussian sampling and a sampling correctness loss are used to improve appearance flow.- Experiments show the method achieves competitive quantitative results and generates more realistic inpainting results compared to prior arts, especially for images with distinct structures like faces and buildings. - Ablation studies validate the effects of the proposed structure guidance and appearance flow. The method can also be applied for object removal and image editing tasks.In summary, the main contribution is a two-stage inpainting approach that disentangles structure reconstruction and texture generation for improved results. The use of edge-preserved smooth images and appearance flow are key to separately recovering structures and textures.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage image inpainting method called StructureFlow that first reconstructs missing structures using edge-preserved smooth images and then generates realistic textures by establishing feature correlations between regions using appearance flow.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other research in image inpainting:- It proposes a two-stage model that separates structure reconstruction and texture generation. This is similar to some other recent works like EdgeConnect, but the key difference is the use of edge-preserved smooth images rather than edge maps for structure reconstruction. - For texture generation, it uses an appearance flow approach to establish correlations between missing and existing regions. Using appearance flow for inpainting has been explored before, but this paper makes modifications like Gaussian sampling and a sampling correctness loss to improve training.- It demonstrates strong quantitative results on standard datasets compared to prior works like Contextual Attention and Partial Convolution. The user study also shows it generates more realistic results on complex datasets like faces and buildings.- The two-stage approach allows the model to focus separately on coherent structures and fine details. This is different from most single-stage models that try to generate both simultaneously.- The edge-preserved smoothing technique provides a way to extract structural information while still retaining some useful texture cues, compared to using raw images or edge maps.- The appearance flow additions seem effective at capturing long-range dependencies for texture generation. This addresses a known weakness of CNNs for inpainting.Overall, the innovations around smoothly extracting structure and guiding texture synthesis via appearance flow allow this method to generate high quality results on complex images. The modifications to the appearance flow training also seem to improve convergence. The two-stage approach is intuitive and produces strong visual results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving the structure reconstructor to generate even better global structure predictions. The authors mention this could involve exploring different network architectures or loss functions.- Enhancing the texture generator to synthesize finer details and textures. The authors suggest ideas like using a multi-scale approach or incorporating semantic information.- Applying and adapting the approach to video inpainting tasks by taking temporal information into account. The appearance flow idea could potentially be extended to temporal dimensions.- Evaluating the model on higher resolution images to see if the approach continues to work well. The current experiments are on 256x256 images.- Testing variants and improvements to the appearance flow, such as exploring different sampling strategies beyond Gaussian sampling.- Validating the approach on a more diverse range of image datasets and inpainting tasks beyond the current experiments.- Exploring ways to make the training process more stable and efficient. The paper mentions the notorious difficulty of training generative adversarial networks.- Investigating how to incorporate user interactions and controls to enable more image editing applications. The paper shows some initial interactive editing examples.In summary, the main future directions focus on enhancing both the structure and texture aspects of the model, applying it to videos, scaling it up to larger images, improving the training process, and expanding the applications. The core ideas seem promising for further research.
