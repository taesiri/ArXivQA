# [Decode Neural signal as Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Decoding language directly from brain signals has important applications for assisting communication for those with disabilities and enabling new modes of human-computer interaction. Prior work has focused predominantly on invasive recordings like ECoG, but non-invasive signals like EEG and MEG have more potential for safe, practical use. However, EEG-to-text translation still faces challenges with reliance on teacher forcing evaluation, predominantly BART-based models, and limited exploration of MEG signals.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes NeuSpeech, a pioneering MEG-to-text translation framework using the Whisper encoder-decoder model. In contrast to previous token-based BART approaches, Whisper can capture global sentence context. NeuSpeech is trained end-to-end from scratch on raw MEG waves without preprocessing or augmenting the limited training data. It can generate open-vocabulary text without teacher forcing or pretraining, enabling more realistic free-form decoding.

Main Contributions:
- First work achieving high performance decoding text directly from raw MEG waves, with no reliance on teacher forcing or pretraining.
- Comprehensive analysis across multiple datasets, subjects, layouts, languages, training regimes, model variations and decoding settings to advance the state-of-the-art and rigor in MEG-to-text translation.  
- Introduction of cross-attention based Whisper models to better capture sentence context compared to prior token-level models. On two MEG datasets, NeuSpeech reached 60.3 BLEU-1 score without teacher forcing.
- Demonstration that speech recognition frameworks can unlock effective text translation from non-invasive neural signals, opening promising research directions.

In summary, this paper makes significant advances in exploring the direct MEG-to-text translation task through a comprehensive analysis framework built around a novel deep learning model. Key findings provide guidance to strengthen validity and applicability of thought decoding from neural signals.
