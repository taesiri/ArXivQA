# [$\texttt{COSMIC}$: Mutual Information for Task-Agnostic Summarization   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19457)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Evaluating the quality of text summarizers is challenging due to the subjective notion of "quality" and reliance on human judgments or gold standard summaries.  
- Existing automatic metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore often don't correlate well with human judgments of summary quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel task-oriented evaluation approach that assesses summarizers based on their ability to produce summaries that preserve outcomes of downstream tasks compared to using the full source texts. 
- Establish a theoretical relationship between downstream task error probability and the mutual information (MI) between source texts and generated summaries.
- Introduce COSMIC as a practical implementation of measuring MI using an estimator and sentence embeddings, without need for human annotations. 

Main Contributions:
- A theoretical framing of summarizer evaluation as a statistical inference problem, leading to MI as a reference-free quality metric.
- Practical implementation of MI metric between source and summary distributions using KNIFE estimator. 
- Experimental evaluation showing COSMIC predicts downstream task performance and correlates with human judgment metrics like SEAHORSE better than ROUGE/BERTScore.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel theoretical grounding for evaluation as well as a practical implementation of mutual information to assess the quality of text summarizers in preserving information useful for downstream tasks, without needing human judgments. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance compared to existing metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new mutual information-based metric, COSMIC, for evaluating the quality of text summarization systems in a task-agnostic manner by assessing how well the summaries preserve the necessary information to perform downstream tasks similarly to using the full source texts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. It provides a theoretical setting for summarizer evaluation by framing it as a statistical inference problem and deriving a task-agnostic, reference-free quality metric based on the mutual information (MI) between the distribution of source texts and distribution of summaries. 

2. It proposes a practical implementation of this metric called COSMIC using a MI estimator and sentence embeddings. COSMIC can be used to evaluate how well a summarizer preserves information from the source text that is useful for downstream tasks.

3. It presents an experimental evaluation showing that: (a) MI predicts the performance of downstream tasks, (b) MI correlates with metrics trained on human judgments, and (c) MI is competitive with standard metrics like BERTScore and ROUGE when evaluating summarizers.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a new task-oriented summarizer evaluation approach based on mutual information that is theoretically motivated, has a practical implementation, and is empirically demonstrated to be effective.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Mutual information (MI) - The core metric proposed in the paper for evaluating summarizers. It measures how much information the summary distribution retains about the source text distribution.

- Task-oriented evaluation - The paper proposes evaluating summarizers based on their ability to produce summaries that preserve outcomes for downstream tasks, without access to the full source texts. 

- Information preservation - A key criteria proposed is the degree to which summaries retain information from the source texts, as measured by mutual information.

- COSMIC - The practical implementation of the mutual information metric introduced in the paper for evaluating summarizers. 

- KNIFE estimator - The specific mutual information estimation technique leveraged to quantify the MI between source texts and summaries.

- Sentence embeddings - Continuous sentence embeddings are used to enable estimation of mutual information between textual distributions.

- Correlations - Comparative analyses done against metrics like BERTScore and ROUGE to assess how well MI correlates with them and predicts downstream task performance.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed mutual information metric, the task-oriented evaluation framework, the estimation techniques used, correlations analyzed, and the overall COSMIC method for summarization evaluation introduced.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes evaluating summarizers based on the mutual information between the distribution of source texts and the distribution of generated summaries. Why is mutual information a suitable metric for this task-oriented evaluation approach? How does it relate to downstream task performance theoretically?

2. The practical implementation, COSMIC, relies on estimating mutual information using the KNIFE estimator between continuous sentence embeddings of texts and summaries. Why was the KNIFE estimator preferred over a basic Gaussian estimator? What are the benefits of using a mixture model? 

3. The evaluation results demonstrate strong correlation between mutual information and human judgment metrics on relevant axes like attribution and main ideas. However, the correlation is weaker for metrics like grammar and comprehensibility. Why would we expect such a discrepancy based on what mutual information captures about the summaries?

4. While mutual information effectively predicts downstream task performance, other common metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore perform competitively on certain tasks. What are the comparative benefits of using mutual information over these metrics, especially in terms of having a theoretical justification?

5. The normalized mutual information is proposed to enable model comparisons across different datasets. However, the results demonstrate inconsistent correlations. What could be the reasons for this and how can model comparison across datasets be enabled using mutual information?

6. The method relies extensively on the choice of sentence embeddings used to obtain continuous representations before mutual information estimation. How robust is the approach to the choice of embeddings? What improvements can be made? 

7. The estimated mutual information is shown to be asymmetric for the text and summary distributions. How is this asymmetry useful in determining the comparative informativeness of different summarizers?

8. What additional metrics would be useful to use alongside mutual information to enable better assessment of summarization quality along different axes? What types of complementary information do they provide?

9. How valid are the assumptions made in defining the task-oriented evaluation scenario? In what real-world situations would this setting correspond to how summaries are utilized? What are some limitations of this formulation?

10. The evaluation relies on downstream tasks like classification and sentence embeddings, could there be more direct evaluations that capture mutual information's correlation with human judgments? What would be viable approaches for this?
