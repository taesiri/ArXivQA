# [Unbiased organism-agnostic and highly sensitive signal peptide predictor   with deep protein language model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08987)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points and contributions of this paper:

This paper proposes USPNet, a universal and organism-agnostic deep learning framework for signal peptide (SP) classification and cleavage site prediction. The key innovations include: (1) integration of label distribution-aware margin (LDAM) loss with reweighting to address data imbalance in the long-tail label distribution; (2) incorporation of multi-sequence alignment (MSA) transformer or evolutionary scale modeling (ESM) embeddings to encode evolutionary and structural information without group information dependency; and (3) attention-based BiLSTM architecture to model sequence dependencies. Extensive experiments show that USPNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement in SP classification performance over multiple metrics. It demonstrates robust organism-agnostic capability on independent, proteome-wide, and simulated data. Building on this, the authors develop a pipeline for mining novel SP candidates from metagenomics data and discover 347 novel peptides with only 13% max sequence identity but mostly over 0.8 TM-score structural similarity to known SPs. This showcases that despite being a sequence-based method, USPNet has effectively learned to represent protein structural properties, enabling discovery of structurally similar but sequentially distant novel SP candidates at ideal speeds. In summary, USPNet provides a reliable and scalable framework for SP analysis for both computational and experimental research across a wide spectrum of data sources.
