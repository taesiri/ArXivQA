# [A Taxonomy of Ambiguity Types for NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ambiguity is inherent in natural language and allows for efficient communication, but is often ignored in NLP systems. 
- Different types of ambiguity may pose different challenges for NLP systems to resolve.
- No comprehensive taxonomy of ambiguity types exists to facilitate analysis of NLP systems' abilities across ambiguity phenomena.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a new taxonomy that categorizes ambiguities in English into 11 types - lexical, syntactic, scopal, elliptical, collective/distributive, implicative, presuppositional, idiomatic, coreferential, generic/non-generic, and type/token.
- Provide explanations and examples of each ambiguity type.
- Apply this taxonomy to annotate existing NLP benchmarks like AmbiEnt to assess the distribution of ambiguity types. 
- Use the taxonomy to create more balanced datasets and targeted tasks/evaluations for underrepresented and difficult ambiguity types.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive taxonomy of 11 ambiguity types seen in English language.
- Framework to facilitate more detailed analysis of ambiguity phenomena in datasets and assessments of models' capabilities. 
- Can lead to more nuanced ambiguity benchmarks and insights into models' limitations across different ambiguity types.

The taxonomy lays the groundwork for better understanding ambiguity handling in NLP through more granular analysis based on phenomena rather than just overall performance. Applying this taxonomy can reveal the extent of various ambiguities in benchmarks, allow creation of more balanced datasets, and show how well models can resolve specific types of ambiguities.
