# [Robustness Over Time: Understanding Adversarial Examples' Effectiveness   on Longitudinal Versions of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07847)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How does the robustness of large language models (LLMs) change over time as they are continually updated?

In particular, the paper aims to evaluate the robustness of different longitudinal versions of the ChatGPT model when faced with adversarial examples generated using existing attack methods. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Updated versions of ChatGPT will demonstrate increased robustness against adversarial attacks compared to earlier versions.

2) Combining different types of adversarial examples (e.g. adversarial prompts and adversarial questions) will have a synergistic effect that makes attacks more effective compared to individual attacks. 

3) Adversarial examples generated against one version of ChatGPT will transfer poorly to updated versions, indicating improved robustness over time.

The paper tests these hypotheses through extensive experiments using adversarial prompts and questions generated from surrogate models, evaluating two main ChatGPT versions (v0301 and v0613) on metrics like clean test scores, robust test scores and performance drop rates. The goal is to comprehensively assess if robustness against adversarial threats improves in ChatGPT as it is updated over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. This paper presents the first comprehensive robustness evaluation of longitudinally updated large language models (LLMs), focusing on different versions of GPT-3.5. 

2. The authors evaluate the robustness of GPT-3.5 versions against adversarial examples generated through two frameworks: zero-shot learning and few-shot learning. Multiple configurations of adversarial queries are tested by combining adversarial descriptions, demonstrations, and questions.

3. The results show that the updated GPT-3.5 version (v0613) does not exhibit enhanced robustness compared to the earlier version (v0301) against the adversarial queries. In many cases, v0613 demonstrates lower robustness, challenging the notion that model updates lead to monotonic improvements. 

4. The analysis highlights the increased effectiveness of combining different types of adversarial examples, especially in zero-shot learning. This underscores the importance of considering synergistic effects when updating LLMs.

5. The authors emphasize the need for comprehensive robustness evaluation of LLMs over time, through metrics like clean test scores, robust test scores, and performance drop rates. The findings provide valuable insights for developers and users regarding model updates.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous longitudinal analysis of adversarial robustness in updated LLMs, revealing important implications for both robustness research and responsible AI practices around large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of evaluating adversarial robustness of large language models:

- This paper takes a longitudinal approach by looking at multiple versions of the same model (GPT-3.5) over time. Most prior work has focused on evaluating robustness of a single model version. Looking at model evolution is a novel aspect.

- The paper comprehensively evaluates robustness across different types of adversarial attacks (on description, question, and both), across both zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. This provides a more complete picture compared to papers that look at just one attack type or learning setting.

- The paper examines both attack effectiveness (using PDR) and model utility (using clean and robust test scores). Some prior work has focused only on attack success rates without considering model performance on clean data. 

- The paper uses adversarial examples transferred from other surrogate models rather than crafting new attacks tailored to GPT-3.5. This evaluates generalization of attacks across models. Other work often focuses on white-box attacks optimized for a specific model.

- The scope is limited to GPT models. Many recent papers have looked at adversarial robustness across multiple model architectures (e.g. BERT, GPT, T5).

- The paper does not propose new attacks or defense methods. It is an evaluation paper rather than presenting novel techniques.

Overall, the longitudinal analysis and comprehensive evaluation across different settings help provide useful insights into how adversarial robustness evolves over time with model updates. The transferability testing is also notable. But the scope is fairly narrow and methodology is evaluation-focused rather than technique-driven compared to some related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding the analysis to include more versions of GPT. The current study focuses predominantly on two versions of GPT-3 (v0301 and v0613). The authors suggest expanding the evaluation to include newer versions like GPT-4 as they are released. 

- Evaluating other large language models (LLMs) over time. In addition to different versions of GPT, the authors propose applying their longitudinal robustness assessment approach to other major LLMs like LLaMA. This would provide insights into robustness changes across different model families.

- Generating and evaluating adversarial examples directly on the target LLMs. Due to the high cost, the current study relies on transferring adversarial examples from surrogate models. The authors suggest overcoming this limitation by directly generating adversarial examples on the target LLMs. 

- Considering other elements in the adversarial queries. The current study focuses on adversarial descriptions and questions. The authors propose expanding the analysis to incorporate adversarial demonstrations as well when generating the adversarial queries.

- Developing more refined evaluation metrics. Additional metrics beyond accuracy, robust accuracy and performance drop rate are suggested to enable more nuanced assessment of model robustness over time.

- Incorporating robustness enhancements during LLM updates. The authors emphasize the need to integrate robust training, adversarial training, and other techniques proactively into the LLM update process.

- Continuous adversarial testing during model development. The authors highlight the importance of ongoing adversarial evaluations to identify emerging vulnerabilities and guide incremental model improvements.

In summary, the key directions involve expanding the scope and scale of analysis across more models, tasks and timepoints; generating more diverse and sophisticated adversarial examples directly on target models; developing more discerning evaluation metrics; and integrating robustness considerations thoroughly into the model update cycle.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the robustness of successive versions of large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on GPT-3.5. It utilizes adversarial examples in the framework of in-context learning to evaluate two distinct versions of GPT-3.5 (v0301 and v0613). The study considers different types of adversarial queries in both zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. Extensive experiments are conducted using adversarial examples transferred from various surrogate models. The key findings indicate that the updated v0613 model does not demonstrate enhanced robustness compared to v0301. In many cases, v0613 exhibits lower performance and increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks. The results highlight the importance of incorporating robustness considerations when updating LLMs, as model improvements may not automatically translate to greater adversarial resilience. The study provides valuable insights into the longitudinal robustness of LLMs and the need for rigorous evaluation of model updates from a security perspective.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a robustness evaluation of successive versions of large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on GPT-3.5. The authors use adversarial examples within an in-context learning framework to assess the robustness of two versions of GPT-3.5 (v0301 and v0613). Their key findings are threefold. First, they find that the updated v0613 model does not demonstrate clear robustness improvements compared to v0301. Second, they show that v0613 exhibits performance declines on certain datasets/tasks compared to v0301, challenging the notion that model updates strictly lead to enhancements. Third, combining adversarial descriptions and questions synergistically amplifies the attack impact and complexity. 

Overall, the study reveals complex dynamics in LLM robustness over time. The results indicate that model updates do not automatically confer greater robustness against prior adversarial strategies. The authors emphasize the need for comprehensive robustness evaluations spanning utility metrics, attack metrics, and synergistic perturbations when comparing longitudinal LLM versions. They suggest their analysis provides valuable insights about robustness considerations for both LLM developers and users when models are iteratively updated. The work calls attention to explicitly prioritizing robustness during LLM evolution to proactively address emerging vulnerabilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the robustness of longitudinal versions of large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on GPT-3.5. The main method used is evaluating adversarial examples within the in-context learning framework on different versions of GPT-3.5 (v0301 and v0613). 

The key steps are:

1) Generate adversarial examples for the description and question components of in-context learning queries using existing attack methods on surrogate models like T5, BERT, etc. This results in adversarial descriptions and adversarial questions.

2) Construct different types of adversarial queries by combining clean and adversarial description/question elements:
- For zero-shot learning: queries with 1 or 2 adversarial elements 
- For few-shot learning: queries with 1 or 2 adversarial elements

3) Evaluate the robustness of GPT-3.5 v0301 and v0613 on these adversarial queries using metrics like Clean Test Score, Robust Test Score, Performance Drop Rate.

4) Compare the metrics between the two GPT-3.5 versions to analyze if robustness has improved over time. Also evaluate adversarial transferability between the versions.

In summary, the key method is evaluating adversarial examples generated from surrogate models on different versions of the target LLM GPT-3.5 in in-context learning scenarios to understand how robustness changes over time.
