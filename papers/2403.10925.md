# [Learning Dual-Level Deformable Implicit Representation for Real-World   Scale Arbitrary Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing works on single image scale arbitrary super-resolution (SR) are limited to simulated datasets, where low-resolution (LR) images are generated from ground truths by simple bicubic downsampling. These models fail to generalize to real-world scenarios due to complex and unknown real-world degradation processes. Prior real-world SR works only focus on integer scale factors. There is a need for real-world scale arbitrary SR that can handle both integer and non-integer factors.

Proposed Solution:
This paper makes two main contributions - 
1) A new dataset called RealArbiSR with 200 training and 50/83 testing images covering integer and non-integer scale factors from 1.5x to 4x for real-world scale arbitrary SR.
2) A novel Dual-level Deformable Implicit Representation (DDIR) model that handles complex real-world degradations by modeling image and pixel-level deformations using an appearance embedding and deformation field respectively.

The appearance embedding captures photometric variations over the entire image to account for exposure, tone-mapping etc. changes when zooming. The deformation field models pixel-level RGB differences from real-world vs bicubic degradation as a proxy to handle spatially variant kernels. Together they provide a robust representation.

Results:
Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results with over 0.3dB PSNR improvement on RealArbiSR and competitive performance on RealSR compared to real-world SR methods, proving effectiveness for scale arbitrary SR under complex real-world settings.

Main Contributions:
1) First real-world dataset with non-integer factors for scale arbitrary SR
2) Novel dual-level deformable model to handle real-world degradations
3) State-of-the-art results on real-world scale arbitrary SR
