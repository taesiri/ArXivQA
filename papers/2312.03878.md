# [Domain constraints improve risk prediction when outcome data is missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models are often used to predict outcomes that result from a human decision, like whether a patient tested for a disease will test positive. 
- However, the human decision process censors the outcome data available for training models. Outcomes are only observed for the subpopulation that was historically tested by humans.
- Untested patients may differ from tested patients in both observed features (recorded in the data) and unobserved features (known only to the human decision maker). So there is a challenging distribution shift.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Bayesian model to estimate disease risk for both tested and untested patients. The model captures the relationship between observed features, unobserved features, disease risk, and testing decisions.
- They incorporate two domain constraints to improve inference: 
   1) A prevalence constraint, where the overall disease prevalence is assumed known.
   2) An expertise constraint, where testing decisions deviate from risk-based allocation only along a subset of features.
- They prove theoretically and show empirically on synthetic data that these constraints improve parameter inference.

Contributions:
- Novel Bayesian model class to estimate risk in selective labels settings like healthcare. The model nests classic econometric models.
- Two proposed domain constraints - prevalence and expertise - which are plausible in medical settings. Proof and experiments showing constraints improve inference.  
- Application to breast cancer risk prediction. Suite of validations showing the model:
   1) Predicts cancer risk for both tested and untested groups
   2) Infers unobservables correlating with true unobservables  
   3) Captures known risk factors and testing policies
   4) Identifies suboptimalities in historical test allocation
- Analysis highlights a general class of constraints to improve inference in selective labels settings across domains.
