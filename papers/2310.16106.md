# [Decentralized Learning over Wireless Networks with Broadcast-Based   Subgraph Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16106)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers decentralized machine learning over wireless networks using consensus-based decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD). 
- Existing works characterize convergence speed of D-SGD by error reduction per iteration, but do not account for actual runtime/communication costs per iteration.
- There is a tradeoff between runtime per iteration and convergence rate. Access control protocols affect communication costs per iteration, so partial communication schemes can accelerate convergence per unit cost.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes BASS, an efficient communication framework for D-SGD over wireless networks using broadcast transmission and probabilistic subgraph sampling.  
- The network topology is divided into collision-free subsets where nodes can broadcast simultaneously. These subsets are randomly sampled each iteration based on node importance. 
- Asymmetric information flow is handled by only keeping bidirectional links to maintain communication symmetry.
- Node sampling probabilities and mixing matrix are optimized to accelerate convergence under a constraint on average communication cost per iteration.

Key Contributions:
- Leverages broadcasting nature of wireless networks to disseminate more information per transmission slot, via subgraph sampling scheme.
- Addresses asymmetry issue caused by broadcast communication in decentralized learning.
- Optimizes scheduling probabilities based on node importance characterized by impact on network connectivity.
- Optimizes mixing matrix to speed up convergence.
- Shows significant performance gain over existing methods, especially in dense networks, under same communication budget.

In summary, the key idea is to sample connectivity-critical subgraphs with higher probability to speed up decentralized learning per unit communication cost in wireless networks, taking advantage of broadcast transmissions. The method handles asymmetry and optimizes scheduling and mixing strategies accordingly.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes BASS, a broadcast-based subgraph sampling method to accelerate consensus-based decentralized stochastic gradient descent for collaborative machine learning over wireless networks by activating connectivity-critical nodes more frequently under a limited communication budget.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing BASS, a broadcast-based subgraph sampling method to accelerate the convergence of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) for decentralized learning over wireless networks under limited communication constraints. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) Divide the communication topology into multiple collision-free subsets, where nodes in each subset can broadcast simultaneously without collisions. 

2) Adopt a probabilistic approach to activate these subsets over time, assigning higher probabilities to subsets containing more "important" nodes critical for network connectivity.

3) Address the asymmetry caused by broadcast-based communication by constructing symmetric Laplacian matrices from the directed subgraphs. 

4) Optimize the mixing matrix design and scheduling probabilities to speed up convergence per transmission slot under a given communication budget constraint. 

5) Demonstrate through simulations that BASS outperforms existing link-based scheduling schemes by taking more advantage of broadcast transmissions to disseminate more information with the same number of slots.

In summary, the key novelty is developing a broadcast-aware subgraph sampling method that exploits the broadcasting capability of wireless channels to accelerate decentralized learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulations are provided to showcase the benefits of the proposed BASS framework.
