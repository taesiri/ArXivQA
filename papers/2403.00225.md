# [Robust Policy Learning via Offline Skill Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing skill-based RL approaches rely on pretrained skills from offline datasets. However, they struggle to adapt to downstream tasks that belong to different domains than the source domains in the datasets. 
- Skills required for a task can vary depending on the domain. So policies learned with pretrained skills may lead to sub-optimal performance when target domain diverges from dataset domains.
- It is difficult to obtain comprehensive datasets spanning all potential skills for diverse domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- Present a novel framework called DuSkill for robust policy learning via offline skill diffusion. 
- Employ a guided diffusion model along with hierarchical domain encoder to disentangle skills into domain-invariant and domain-variant embeddings.
- Domain-invariant encoder captures features to reconstruct fundamental actions to achieve goals. 
- Domain-variant encoder captures features related to domain variations.
- Two separate decoders are conditioned on each embedding to distinctly influence generated actions.
- Enables generation of diverse skills with different combinations of domain-invariant and variant features.

Main Contributions:
- Propose DuSkill framework to facilitate robust skill-based policy learning for downstream tasks in different domains.
- Develop offline skill diffusion model to disentangle and generate skills beyond limitations of training datasets.
- Demonstrate improved performance over baselines in few-shot imitation and online RL for long-horizon tasks.
- Show benefits of expanding skill diversity for adapting policies to varied domains.

In summary, the paper tackles skill adaptation challenges for downstream tasks in new domains. It uses a novel guided diffusion model to disentangle and generate more diverse skills from limited datasets. This enhances robustness for few-shot and online policy learning across different domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework called DuSkill that uses a guided diffusion model along with hierarchical skill embeddings to generate diverse skills from limited offline datasets, enabling robust policy learning for downstream tasks in different domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting the DuSkill framework, which facilitates robust skill-based policy learning for downstream tasks in different domains.

2. Developing the offline skill diffusion model, incorporating the hierarchical domain encoder and guided diffusion-based decoder. The model enables the diverse skill generation that extends beyond the training datasets. 

3. Testing the framework with long-horizon tasks in various domains, demonstrating its capability to adapt to different domains in both few-shot imitation and online RL settings.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework called DuSkill that can generate diverse skills from limited offline datasets, thereby enhancing robustness for policy learning in downstream tasks belonging to different domains, beyond what the offline datasets cover. This is achieved via a guided diffusion model combined with disentangled skill representations.

The paper presents a framework called "DuSkill" for robust policy learning via offline skill diffusion. The key ideas involve using a guided diffusion model along with hierarchical encoders to disentangle skills into domain-invariant and domain-variant embeddings. This allows for generating diverse skills from limited offline datasets that can accelerate policy learning for downstream tasks, including via few-shot imitation or online reinforcement learning. The method is evaluated on multi-stage Meta-World environments with domain shifts.
