# [Attention-based Shape and Gait Representations Learning for Video-based   Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03716)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current video-based person re-identification (re-id) methods rely primarily on appearance features extracted by deep learning models. These methods fail in long-term real-world scenarios where people change clothes, making appearance cues unreliable for matching identities across cameras. This leads to the problem of video-based cloth-changing person re-identification (VCCRe-ID). Existing methods for this task have limitations: 1) texture-based methods fail under occlusion, 2) gait-based methods using 2D pose are sensitive to viewpoint changes, and 3) methods do not efficiently capture local temporal motion patterns from video.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Attention-based Shape and Gait Representations Learning (ASGL) framework for VCCRe-ID. The key ideas are:

1) Simultaneously extract body shape and gait features using graph attention networks (GATs) applied on 3D skeleton-based human poses over the video. This provides clothing-invariant identity cues.  

2) For gait learning, design a spatial-temporal GAT with multi-head self-attention blocks. This amplifies important motion ranges, reduces the influence of noisy poses under occlusion/viewpoint changes, and captures beneficial local dynamics. 

3) For shape learning, use a GAT on the pose graph to model relationships between body parts and extract a discriminative shape embedding.

4) Fuse shape, gait and appearance features using an adaptive module to maximize matching ability.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel ASGL framework for long-term VCCRe-ID by jointly learning shape and gait representations using attention-based graph networks.

2) Spatial-temporal graph attention network to effectively encode gait cues from 3D skeleton sequences.

3) State-of-the-art performance on large-scale public VCCRe-ID datasets, outperforming existing methods by 12.2% rank-1 accuracy and 7.0% mAP.

4) Extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of key components like 3D pose, attention mechanisms, and fusion of modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end framework called Attention-based Shape and Gait Representations Learning for video-based cloth-changing person re-identification that enhances the robustness of features under clothing variations by extracting body shape and gait cues using graph attention networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose ASGL, a novel framework for the long-term video-based cloth-changing person re-identification (VCCRe-ID) task. 

2) They propose a spatial-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) for gait learning and a graph attention network (GAT) for shape learning. These help to enhance the discriminative power of identity representations under clothing variations and viewpoint changes.

3) They present extensive experiments on two large-scale public VCCRe-ID datasets and demonstrate that their framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on the VCCR dataset, their method achieves 52.9% rank-1 accuracy and 43.2% mAP, outperforming prior arts by over 12% in rank-1 accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the ASGL framework with novel components like ST-GAT and GAT to effectively address the cloth-changing person re-identification problem in video data. The experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of their approach.

The paper proposes a framework called "Attention-based Shape and Gait Representations Learning" (ASGL) for the task of video-based cloth-changing person re-identification. It utilizes graph attention networks and spatial-temporal graph learning on estimated 3D poses to extract clothing-invariant identity cues like body shape and gait. The key components include a spatial-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) for gait learning, a graph attention network (GAT) for shape learning, and an adaptive fusion module to combine appearance, shape and gait features. Experiments are conducted on two video-based cloth-changing person re-id datasets.
