# [Reliable uncertainty with cheaper neural network ensembles: a case study   in industrial parts classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Neural networks (NNs) are gaining popularity in operations research (OR) for tasks like image classification. However, NNs tend to make overconfident yet incorrect predictions when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data not present in the training set. This behavior poses risks when deploying NNs in OR. Deep ensembles, comprising multiple NNs, provide reliable uncertainty estimates to identify OOD data. However, training and deploying them incurs substantial computational overhead.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper provides the first comprehensive comparison between a single NN, a deep ensemble, and three efficient NN ensembles - snapshot ensemble, batch ensemble, and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) ensemble. The techniques are evaluated on an industrial parts classification case study to identify unknown spare parts. A novel Diversity Quality (DQ) metric is introduced to jointly assess performance on in-distribution and OOD test sets.

Main Contributions:
- Batch ensemble delivers superior accuracy and uncertainty compared to deep ensemble, with 7x faster training, 8x faster evaluation and 9x less memory (for ensemble size 10).
- Snapshot ensemble exhibits poor accuracy. MIMO ensemble shows limited diversity and uncertainty on OOD data.
- Batch ensemble with random signed vectors for initialisation of fast weights works best.
- Proposed DQ metric effectively evaluates uncertainty quality on joint in-distribution and OOD test sets.
- Study demonstrates batch ensemble is a robust, cost-effective alternative to deep ensembles for deploying performant and safe NNs in OR.

In summary, the paper proposes batch ensemble as an efficient alternative to deep ensembles, facilitating the adoption of reliable uncertainty-aware NNs in operations research applications.
