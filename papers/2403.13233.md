# [Technical Report: Competition Solution For BetterMixture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13233)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is a critical need for large quantities of high-quality training data. However, collecting and curating optimal datasets is challenging. 
- The BetterMixture competition focuses specifically on the task of analyzing and mixing fine-tuning data for LLMs to enhance their performance within computational constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors utilize their Ke-Data-Juicer system which applies data deduplication, low-level filtering (text length and language ID), and high-level filtering (LLM perplexity and instruction following difficulty scoring).
- High quality and diverse data is selected using IFD score thresholds and a k-center greedy algorithm.
- Experiments show step-wise performance gains from using these strategies, with the full approach improving over the baseline by 17% in the competition's final scoring.

Main Contributions:  
- Demonstration of an effective end-to-end solution for mixing instruction tuning data for LLMs, securing 3rd place in the BetterMixture competition.
- Introduction of new high-level data filtering methods using LLM perplexity and instruction following difficulty metrics. 
- Proposal of an LLM IFD-Vote technique to refine quality assessment using multiple model judgments.

In summary, the paper presents an approach to optimize LLM training data combining quality, diversity and computational constraints, with very positive results shown on the competition benchmarks. The data filtering and selection techniques introduced provide promising directions to alleviate data needs for advancing large language models.
