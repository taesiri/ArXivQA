# [Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Research and Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for capable, openly available language models that advance state-of-the-art performance while being responsibly developed and released. Existing open models have limitations in capabilities, safety, and accessibility. 

Proposed Solution - Gemma Models:
- The paper proposes Gemma, a family of open natural language understanding models offered in two sizes - 2B and 7B parameters. 
- Gemma builds on learnings from Google's Gemini model using similar architecture, data, training methodology and evaluation.
- The models demonstrate strong performance across language tasks like question answering, reasoning, math, code generation etc.
- They outperform existing open models of similar sizes on 11 out of 18 text-based benchmarks.
- The paper provides both pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints to enable research into instruction-tuning impacts.
- Comprehensive safety evaluations are shared alongside responsible release practices.

Main Contributions:
- Release of capable and accessible Gemma language models advancing state-of-the-art open model performance. 
- Sharing of pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints to further research into instruction-tuning.
- Safety evaluations and responsible release practices to enable exploration while mitigating potential harms.
- Performance gains over existing models demonstrating capabilities in reasoning, math, code etc.
- The release aims to make such models more accessible and drive innovations in language AI.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary provided. I'm happy to expand on any part of it.
