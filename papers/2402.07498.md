# [Accelerated Smoothing: A Scalable Approach to Randomized Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Accelerated Smoothing: A Scalable Approach to Randomized Smoothing":

Problem:
Randomized smoothing is an effective certified defense against adversarial attacks on neural networks. It provides robustness guarantees by adding random noise to the inputs. However, the use of Monte Carlo sampling makes it computationally expensive as it requires multiple forward passes through the network. This limits the scalability and practical deployment of randomized smoothing. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "Accelerated Smoothing" to address the time complexity issue of randomized smoothing. The key idea is to train a surrogate neural network to predict the class counts obtained from Monte Carlo sampling. Specifically, the surrogate model is trained to map an input image to the frequency distribution over classes by adding Gaussian noise. This avoids the need for actual sampling at test time. The loss function used for training is Jensen-Shannon divergence to match the predicted and true class probability distributions.

Key Contributions:
1. Accelerated Smoothing replaces expensive Monte Carlo sampling with a fast surrogate model to accelerate robustness certification. This reduces inference time by ~600x.

2. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that the certified robust accuracy of Accelerated Smoothing closely matches original randomized smoothing.

3. The proposed method scales significantly better compared to sampling-based approach. It has constant time complexity rather than linear time complexity w.r.t number of samples.

4. The surrogate model training framework is model-agnostic and can approximate smoothed classifier for different architectures, attacks and smoothing distributions.

In summary, Accelerated Smoothing makes certified defenses more practical by providing comparable robustness guarantees as randomized smoothing while overcoming the computational bottlenecks for large-scale deployment.
