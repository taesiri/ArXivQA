# [Leveraging Anchor-based LiDAR 3D Object Detection via Point Assisted   Sample Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper points out an overlooked issue in existing anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detection methods - the ambiguity in training sample allocation based on box Intersection over Union (IoU$_{box}$). This ambiguity stems from relying solely on IoU$_{box}$ to measure the quality of anchor samples. While IoU$_{box}$ reflects the spatial similarity between anchors and ground truth boxes, it fails to measure the completeness of object point features contained in the anchors due to the sparsity of LiDAR points. This results in ambiguity in determining high-quality positive/negative samples, which impedes performance improvements.  

Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, the paper proposes a new training sample quality measurement called IoU$_{point}$ that calculates the Intersection over Union of points between anchor and ground truth boxes. This better captures the object features contained in anchors. The paper further proposes a novel anchor sample selection approach called Point Assisted Sample Selection (PASS) that integrates both IoU$_{box}$ and IoU$_{point}$ to select positive, negative and ignored samples more appropriately. PASS reduces the ambiguity during model optimization.

Main Contributions:
1) Points out the ambiguity issue of IoU$_{box}$-based sample selection in anchor-based LiDAR 3D detection for the first time.
2) Proposes a new IoU$_{point}$ measurement to better assess anchor sample quality in terms of completeness of object point features. 
3) Develops a tailored PASS method to reduce ambiguity in sample selection, requiring no extra parameters or inference cost.
4) Achieves new state-of-the-art results by applying PASS to advanced detectors on KITTI and Waymo datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights into an overlooked issue in anchor-based LiDAR 3D detection, and contributes an effective PASS solution to address it. Experiments prove PASS can essentially improve model optimization and performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new training sample selection method called Point Assisted Sample Selection (PASS) to address the ambiguity in anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detection caused by relying solely on IoU of boxes for sample assignment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1) It points out the ambiguity of IoU$_{box}$-based sample selection in existing anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detection methods for the first time. To better capture the semantic features contained within anchor samples in the LiDAR pointcloud domain, a new sample quality measurement IoU$_{point}$ is proposed. Statistical analysis and case studies are conducted to demonstrate the defects of solely using IoU$_{box}$ for sample selection and the importance of incorporating IoU$_{point}$. 

2) A novel training sample assignment method called Point Assisted Sample Selection (PASS) is proposed. By integrating both IoU$_{box}$ and IoU$_{point}$, PASS provides a clearer assessment of anchor quality to facilitate unambiguous feature learning during model optimization.

3) Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From a practical perspective, PASS can be plug-and-play applied to train any anchor-based LiDAR 3D object detector without introducing additional model parameters or inference time cost.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions by proposing the PASS method to address the ambiguity issue of anchor-based training sample selection in LiDAR 3D object detection, which helps improve model optimization and push the performance limits of anchor-based detectors.
