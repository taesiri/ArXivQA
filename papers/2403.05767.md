# [Extending Activation Steering to Broad Skills and Multiple Behaviours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models can have dangerous capabilities that may become more problematic in the future. Methods like prompting and reinforcement learning face challenges in reducing these risks.  
- Activation steering techniques change a model's activations during inference to steer the output, unlike weight editing methods which permanently change the model. 
- Prior activation steering work has focused on individual behaviors or narrow skills. This paper investigates using activation steering for broad skills and multiple behaviors.

Methods
- Experiments were done with the 7B parameter LLaMA model. 
- For broad steering, steering vectors were generated to reduce general coding ability and Python-specific ability relative to performance on text. Alignment tax was measured.
- For multi-steering, steering vectors were first generated for five behaviors - myopia, wealth-seeking, agreeableness etc. Vectors were then combined into one vector or injected simultaneously at different layers.

Results
- Broad steering for coding ability and Python ability was successful and competitive, contradicting the hypothesis that steering broad skills would have smaller effect sizes.
- Combining steering vectors into one vector largely failed while injecting vectors simultaneously at different layers showed promise, with minor alignment tax.  

Conclusions
- Activation steering can work for broad skills, though finding the right setup is challenging. 
- Simultaneous injection of steering vectors mitigates issues with combined vectors.
- More work is needed on best practices for activation steering and testing different models.

The paper makes contributions in analyzing activation steering for broad skills and multiple behaviors, finding that simultaneous injection shows promise as an extension.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

When extending activation steering techniques to reduce either broad skills like general coding ability or multiple behaviors simultaneously in language models, steering broad skills remains effective while simply combining or injecting multiple steering vectors often becomes less reliable or effective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is an investigation into whether activation steering techniques can be extended to steer towards broad skills (e.g. general coding ability) and multiple behaviors simultaneously. The key findings are:

1) Steering towards the broad skill of general coding ability is as effective as steering towards the narrower skill of Python coding ability. This counters the hypothesis that steering broader skills would be less effective.

2) Combining steering vectors for multiple behaviors into one vector is largely unsuccessful in steering the model. However, injecting individual steering vectors simultaneously at different places in the model shows more promise. 

3) There is no substantial alignment tax (performance cost) when steering a single broad skill. For simultaneous multi-behavior steering, the alignment tax also appears minor.

So in summary, the main contribution is an analysis of how well activation steering extends to broad skills and multiple behaviors, finding that simultaneous steering shows the most promise. The paper also analyzes the alignment tax in these extended settings.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Activation steering - A technique to change a language model's activations during inference to steer the output. The paper investigates extending this method.

- Broad skills - Steering towards removing broader capabilities, like general coding ability, rather than narrow skills. The paper examines if this is feasible. 

- Multiple behaviors - Steering to remove multiple unwanted behaviors at once, through either combining steering vectors or injecting them simultaneously. The paper tests if this works.

- Alignment tax - The tradeoff between steering away unwanted behaviors and reducing overall model performance. The paper examines if the alignment tax increases when extending activation steering.

- Effect size - The size of the effect of steering on removing certain skills/behaviors. The paper hypothesizes smaller effect sizes when steering broader skills or multiple behaviors.

- Interaction effects - When injecting steering vectors simultaneously, they may interact and reduce steering quality. The paper investigates if this occurs.

- Matching score - The probability of a model giving the desired/matched response. Used to evaluate steering success.

So in summary, the key concepts cover activation steering methods, steering complexity (broad or multiple behaviors), model performance tradeoffs, and quantitative evaluation of steering effects.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces two main hypotheses - that extending activation steering to broad skills or multiple behaviors will lead to smaller effect sizes, and that it will lead to a larger alignment tax. What evidence from the results supports or contradicts these hypotheses? 

2. The paper finds that steering vectors work well for reducing broad skills like general coding ability. Why might this counterintuitive finding have occurred, given their hypothesis? What are some alternative explanations explored in the discussion?

3. The simultaneous steering method shows promise for steering multiple behaviors without substantially increasing the alignment tax. What explanations are provided for why this method works better than combined steering? What are the proposed reasons that interaction effects do not seem to be an issue?

4. The flexibility of activation steering methods is described as a double-edged sword. What are the benefits of this flexibility? On the other hand, what challenges does it introduce in terms of finding an optimal setup?

5. What future research directions are proposed to further test the limits of activation steering for broad skills and multiple behaviors? For example, how could the impact on narrower skills be tested?  

6. The discussion mentions that the matching scores may not fully capture the "real" risks from language models. What considerations should be kept in mind regarding how well the matching scores translate to risks in open-ended generation?

7. Simultaneous steering injects steering vectors at different layers with the same global coefficient. How might results be further improved by using different coefficients per vector or targeting different components within layers?

8. For the counterintuitive result of improved coding ability when targeting layer 0, what speculative theory involving copy suppression is proposed? How could this be tested further?

9. What role might sparse vs. dense models play in the feasibility of steering for multiple behaviors? Why might sparsity help Activation Steering methods extend further?  

10. Combined steering tries directly combining steering vectors in various ways but runs into issues. Simultaneous steering avoids combining vectors - what insights does this give about the latent spaces corresponding to different behaviors in large language models?
