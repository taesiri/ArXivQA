# [Extending Activation Steering to Broad Skills and Multiple Behaviours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models can have dangerous capabilities that may become more problematic in the future. Methods like prompting and reinforcement learning face challenges in reducing these risks.  
- Activation steering techniques change a model's activations during inference to steer the output, unlike weight editing methods which permanently change the model. 
- Prior activation steering work has focused on individual behaviors or narrow skills. This paper investigates using activation steering for broad skills and multiple behaviors.

Methods
- Experiments were done with the 7B parameter LLaMA model. 
- For broad steering, steering vectors were generated to reduce general coding ability and Python-specific ability relative to performance on text. Alignment tax was measured.
- For multi-steering, steering vectors were first generated for five behaviors - myopia, wealth-seeking, agreeableness etc. Vectors were then combined into one vector or injected simultaneously at different layers.

Results
- Broad steering for coding ability and Python ability was successful and competitive, contradicting the hypothesis that steering broad skills would have smaller effect sizes.
- Combining steering vectors into one vector largely failed while injecting vectors simultaneously at different layers showed promise, with minor alignment tax.  

Conclusions
- Activation steering can work for broad skills, though finding the right setup is challenging. 
- Simultaneous injection of steering vectors mitigates issues with combined vectors.
- More work is needed on best practices for activation steering and testing different models.

The paper makes contributions in analyzing activation steering for broad skills and multiple behaviors, finding that simultaneous injection shows promise as an extension.
