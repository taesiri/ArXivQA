# [Randomized Algorithms for Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08134)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF). SymNMF aims to approximate a symmetric matrix as the product of a nonnegative low-rank matrix and its transpose. It has applications in areas like graph clustering, image segmentation, etc. However, existing SymNMF algorithms do not scale well to large datasets. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two randomized algorithms to speed up SymNMF - 
1) Low-rank Approximate Input SymNMF (LAI-SymNMF): This method first uses a randomized technique called Randomized Range Finder to compute an initial low-rank approximation of the input matrix. It then runs an efficient SymNMF algorithm on this low-rank input. As matrix-matrix multiplications with the full input are expensive, using a low-rank input speeds up computations.
2) LvS-SymNMF: This method uses a technique called leverage score sampling to only sample and use a subset of rows/columns of matrices when solving least squares problems within SymNMF iterations. This reduces computational costs. A hybrid sampling scheme is proposed that combines deterministic and random sampling.

Main Contributions:  
1) The first randomized algorithms for SymNMF that enable scaling to large datasets
2) LAI-SymNMF method that works for multiple SymNMF algorithms like multiplicative updates, alternating least squares etc. Novel adaptive scheme proposed to compute better initial low-rank approximation
3) LvS-SymNMF with solid theoretical analysis of using leverage score sampling for nonnegative least squares problems
4) Hybrid leverage score sampling scheme with theoretical analysis of sample complexity
5) Empirical evaluation on real-world graph clustering tasks demonstrating 5-7.5x speedups and maintained accuracy

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing the first randomized algorithms for SymNMF with strong theoretical foundations and demonstrates their effectiveness on real graph clustering problems. The algorithms provide a way to scale up SymNMF to large datasets.
