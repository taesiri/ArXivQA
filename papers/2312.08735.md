## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Polyper, a new boundary sensitive framework for polyp segmentation. The key idea is to leverage the interior regions of polyps to refine the boundary features, motivated by how expert clinicians utilize interior polyp characteristics to identify blurred boundaries. The method first generates an initial segmentation and extracts the boundary and interior regions using morphological operators. Then, a novel boundary sensitive attention module is proposed to model relationships between the boundary and interior regions, enabling refinement of boundary features. This captures both global context and local features to delineate accurate polyp boundaries. Experiments on five challenging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The method is compatible with various encoder architectures and shows particular strength in segmenting small polyps. Ablations validate the efficacy of the boundary sensitive refinement strategy. By mimicking clinical approaches, Polyper offers an effective solution to the critical challenge of blurred polyp boundaries in endoscopic imaging.
