# [Unsupervised Learning of High-resolution Light Field Imaging via Beam   Splitter-based Hybrid Lenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Light field (LF) cameras have limited spatial resolution due to the resolution bandwidth trade-off. Super-resolving LF images is challenging especially in real-world scenarios due to lack of ground truth data and domain gap between simulated and real data. Existing LF super-resolution (SR) methods rely on strong supervision and thus suffer from performance degradation on real data.

Proposed Solution:
1) A beam splitter-based hybrid LF imaging prototype is designed to simultaneously capture a low-resolution (LR) 4D LF image and a high-resolution (HR) 2D image. The HR image serves as the ground truth for the central view of the LF image.

2) An unsupervised learning-based LF spatial SR framework is proposed that takes the LR LF image and HR central view as input. The framework has three key components:
(i) Central view synthesis network (CVS-Net) to synthesize central view from side views 
(ii) Backward degradation network (BD-Net) to reconstruct LR LF from super-resolved LF
(iii) Hybrid LF spatial SR network (HLFSSR-Net) which super-resolves the LF guided by two losses computed using the above networks.

3) Two losses are specially designed to guide unsupervised learning:
(i) HR-aware loss between HR image and CVS-Net output to guide detail learning 
(ii) EPI gradient loss between input and BD-Net output LF to preserve parallax structure

4) HLFSSR-Net architecture uses dual branches for HR view and LR LF followed by fusion to leverage hybrid inputs effectively.

Contributions:
1) A hardware prototype to capture hybrid resolution LF images with built-in ground truth.

2) First end-to-end unsupervised learning framework for LF super-resolution that does not need actual HR side views for training. Achieves comparable performance to supervised state-of-the-art methods.

3) Carefully designed pre-training strategy and losses to enable unsupervised learning of spatial details and angular structure from the hybrid inputs.

4) Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions on both simulated and real hybrid LF datasets. The framework could help promote LF resolution enhancement applications by overcoming ground truth limitations.
