# [NL2Formula: Generating Spreadsheet Formulas from Natural Language   Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Writing formulas on spreadsheets is challenging for end-users. Natural language interfaces to generate executable spreadsheet formulas from users' requests can enhance usability.  
- However, existing datasets and models are limited in this capability.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced a new task NL2Formula - generating spreadsheet formulas from natural language and tabular context.
- Constructed a dataset with 70k instances covering diverse tables and rich formula functions (37 types). Data is augmented from Text2SQL datasets and rule-based conversion.
- Proposed fCoder, a sequence-to-sequence model based on T5 that encodes the natural language, table, and generates target formula.

Main Contributions:  
- Formulated the novel NL2Formula task to translate natural language queries into executable spreadsheet formulas.
- Compiled a comprehensive dataset of 70k pairs of natural language descriptions and formulas grounded on 21k tables. 
- Developed a strong neural baseline model fCoder that achieves 70.6% exact match accuracy, outperforming adapted existing approaches. 
- Analyzed model performance across varying formula types and hardness levels. Identified challenges around evidence inference and intent understanding.

The paper makes the first robust effort at facilitating formula generation from natural language for end user productivity. The constructed benchmark and analysis open up an important new research direction.
