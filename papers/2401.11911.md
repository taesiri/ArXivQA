# [Blinded by Generated Contexts: How Language Models Merge Generated and   Retrieved Contexts for Open-Domain QA?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11911)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being augmented with auxiliary information from two sources - generated contexts (by prompting the LLM to generate relevant information) and retrieved contexts (extracting relevant passages from external corpora). 
- However, there is little understanding of how well LLMs can merge and resolve conflicts between these two types of contexts when they contain contradictory information. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors design a framework and specialized datasets to analyze how LLMs resolve conflicts and merge generated vs retrieved contexts. 
- The datasets contain questions paired with conflicting generated and retrieved contexts where only one context contains the correct answer.
- Metrics are introduced to quantify LLMs' preference for generated or retrieved contexts. Experiments are conducted with various LLM reader-generator pairs.

Key Findings:
- LLMs exhibit a strong bias towards generated contexts over retrieved contexts, even when the generated contexts contain incorrect answers. This holds across open and closed domain LLMs.
- Two key factors identified behind this bias are:
   1) Higher similarity of generated contexts with the questions
   2) Incompleteness of retrieved contexts due to passage segmentation
- Controlling for confirmation bias does not eliminate this preference for generated contexts.

Main Contributions:  
- Uncovers significant bias of LLMs to overly rely on generated contexts regardless of correctness
- Develops specialized datasets and metrics to facilitate analysis 
- Identifies key factors (text similarity and passage completeness) affecting LLMs' context utilization
- Provides guidance (e.g. improving passage segmentation) for enhancing context integration in LLMs

The paper highlights a critical challenge faced by current LLMs in effectively merging different contextual information sources, especially concerning the proliferation of LLM-generated content. The insights offer valuable guidance for developing advanced context integration techniques and strategies to detect misleading information from LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how large language models merge conflicting information from generated and retrieved contexts for open-domain question answering, finding a bias towards favoring generated contexts even when incorrect, attributable to higher text similarity and greater semantic completeness compared to retrieved contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Uncovering a critical bias in existing large language models (LLMs) where they heavily rely on generated contexts regardless of correctness, indicating an insufficient use of diverse information sources.

2. Developing a specialized process to construct tailored datasets to facilitate controlled experiments on studying how LLMs merge generated and retrieved contexts. 

3. Through extensive analyses, identifying two key factors, i.e. text similarity and semantic completeness, that contribute to the bias of preferring generated contexts over retrieved contexts in LLMs.

The paper provides a better understanding of how LLMs use contexts for question answering tasks. It highlights the issue of context utilization in existing LLMs, especially when generated content may contain misinformation. The findings also offer insights for improving current retrieval-augmented language models.

The paper investigates how large language models merge generated and retrieved contexts when answering open-domain questions, especially when the contexts contain conflicting information. It uncovers a bias in LLMs towards favoring generated contexts over retrieved ones, and analyzes factors like text similarity and semantic completeness that contribute to this phenomenon. The study also involves constructing specialized datasets and formulating an answer tracing task to facilitate analyzing the context merging process of LLMs. Overall, it provides insights into how existing LLMs utilize different context sources and highlights areas for improving context integration in QA systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a task specifically designed to identify whether the answers derived from the integration of generated and retrieved contexts are attributed to either context. What are some ways this task formulation could be expanded or adapted to study additional aspects of how language models utilize contexts?

2. The paper constructs specialized datasets with conflicting information between the generated and retrieved contexts. What are some considerations in ensuring these datasets accurately reflect potential conflicts arising in real-world applications? How could the dataset construction methodology be enhanced?  

3. The paper finds language models exhibit a bias towards generated contexts. What are some potential reasons this occurs from a technical perspective related to model architecture, objectives, or training methodology? How might models be adapted to mitigate this bias?

4. The analysis reveals text similarity as a significant factor in language models' bias. Why might higher text similarity for generated contexts increase their likelihood of selection by language models? Are there potentially other signals that matter as much or more than text similarity?

5. The paper shows sentence completeness does not significantly impact context preference but semantic completeness does. Why might semantic completeness play a bigger role? How could passage segmentation strategies be improved to maintain completeness?

6. The paper focuses analysis on non-tunable language models. How might the context utilization and integration differ for fine-tuned models? What additional experiments could explore this?

7. The constructed datasets contain only a single generated and retrieved context per question. How might the analysis differ if multiple contexts were provided from each source? What new challenges or insights might that bring?

8. The paper utilizes exact match accuracy to determine context correctness. Would results differ under more advanced answer evaluation schemes? How could the methodology adapt to that?

9. The authors use GPT and LLaMA models in their experiments. Do you expect the core findings would transfer to other model families like T5, PaLM, or BLOOM? What architecture differences might change the context reliance?

10. The paper frames its analysis for open-domain question answering. Could similar methodology be developed to study context usage for other applications like summarization, data-to-text generation, or conversational response? What adaptations would be needed?
