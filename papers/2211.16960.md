# [BASiS: Batch Aligned Spectral Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16960)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a deep network architecture that can learn to approximate the spectral embedding of a graph in a scalable and consistent manner when trained with batches?

The key points are:

- Spectral graph theory provides powerful algorithms for tasks like clustering, but incorporating spectral methods directly in neural networks is challenging due to the eigenvalue computations.

- Prior work has tried to approximate spectral embeddings indirectly by minimizing losses related to the Rayleigh quotient. But this does not guarantee convergence to the true eigenspace. 

- A more direct supervised approach exists, but requires computation of the full spectral embedding on the entire training set, which is not scalable.

- This paper proposes a method called BASiS to directly learn the spectral embedding with batches in a consistent way, by using an alignment mechanism between batches.

So in summary, the main research question is how to design a neural network architecture that can approximate graph spectral embeddings accurately and consistently when trained with batches, in order to leverage the benefits of spectral methods in a scalable deep learning framework. The proposed BASiS method aims to address this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 After reviewing the paper, it appears the main contribution is proposing a new method called BASiS for learning the eigenspace of a graph's Laplacian matrix using batches during training. The key ideas are:

- Directly supervising the network to map features to eigenspace coordinates, unlike previous indirect losses like Rayleigh quotient minimization. This allows better approximation of the true eigenvectors. 

- Using an alignment strategy to make the coordinates consistent across different batches, which is a core problem when embeddings are calculated on batches rather than the full graph. This enables scalable training.

- Allowing iterative changes to the graph affinity metric during training via an alignment technique. This enables end-to-end training when features are updated.

- Achieving excellent results on various benchmarks in terms of faithfulness of the embedding, clustering performance, and computational efficiency compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing a batch-trainable spectral graph network module via a direct supervised loss and alignment strategies. This provides an effective differentiable building block that inherits useful properties from spectral graph theory for use in deep learning systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called BASiS to learn the graph spectral embedding in a scalable way using batches, while maintaining consistency between batches through an alignment mechanism.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of spectral graph embedding networks:

- The key contribution of this paper is introducing a new method called BASiS for learning graph spectral embeddings in a supervised manner using batches during training. This helps address limitations of prior works like scalability and consistency of embeddings across batches.

- Prior methods like Diffusion Nets and SpectralNet learn embeddings by optimizing losses related to graph eigenproperties but don't directly supervise with ground truth embeddings. This can lead to less faithful approximations. BASiS directly matches to analytic eigenvectors.

- Diffusion Nets require precomputing embeddings on the full dataset which limits scalability. BASiS trains in batches making it more scalable.

- Consistency of embeddings across batches is an issue for prior methods but BASiS uses alignment techniques to enforce consistency.

- Experiments show BASiS achieves better performance than Diffusion Nets, SpectralNet1, and SpectralNet2 in metrics like Grassman distance, orthogonality, clustering accuracy, etc. This demonstrates the benefits of the direct supervised approach.

- The ability to handle graph metric changes during training also differentiates BASiS from prior works and expands applicability.

Overall, the direct supervised approach and batch alignment technique seem to be the key differentiators of BASiS compared to related spectral graph embedding methods. The paper shows these contributions lead to improved performance and flexibility. The method seems to advance the state-of-the-art in this field.
