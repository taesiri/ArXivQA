# [BASiS: Batch Aligned Spectral Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16960)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a deep network architecture that can learn to approximate the spectral embedding of a graph in a scalable and consistent manner when trained with batches?

The key points are:

- Spectral graph theory provides powerful algorithms for tasks like clustering, but incorporating spectral methods directly in neural networks is challenging due to the eigenvalue computations.

- Prior work has tried to approximate spectral embeddings indirectly by minimizing losses related to the Rayleigh quotient. But this does not guarantee convergence to the true eigenspace. 

- A more direct supervised approach exists, but requires computation of the full spectral embedding on the entire training set, which is not scalable.

- This paper proposes a method called BASiS to directly learn the spectral embedding with batches in a consistent way, by using an alignment mechanism between batches.

So in summary, the main research question is how to design a neural network architecture that can approximate graph spectral embeddings accurately and consistently when trained with batches, in order to leverage the benefits of spectral methods in a scalable deep learning framework. The proposed BASiS method aims to address this problem.
