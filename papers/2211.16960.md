# [BASiS: Batch Aligned Spectral Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16960)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a deep network architecture that can learn to approximate the spectral embedding of a graph in a scalable and consistent manner when trained with batches?

The key points are:

- Spectral graph theory provides powerful algorithms for tasks like clustering, but incorporating spectral methods directly in neural networks is challenging due to the eigenvalue computations.

- Prior work has tried to approximate spectral embeddings indirectly by minimizing losses related to the Rayleigh quotient. But this does not guarantee convergence to the true eigenspace. 

- A more direct supervised approach exists, but requires computation of the full spectral embedding on the entire training set, which is not scalable.

- This paper proposes a method called BASiS to directly learn the spectral embedding with batches in a consistent way, by using an alignment mechanism between batches.

So in summary, the main research question is how to design a neural network architecture that can approximate graph spectral embeddings accurately and consistently when trained with batches, in order to leverage the benefits of spectral methods in a scalable deep learning framework. The proposed BASiS method aims to address this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 After reviewing the paper, it appears the main contribution is proposing a new method called BASiS for learning the eigenspace of a graph's Laplacian matrix using batches during training. The key ideas are:

- Directly supervising the network to map features to eigenspace coordinates, unlike previous indirect losses like Rayleigh quotient minimization. This allows better approximation of the true eigenvectors. 

- Using an alignment strategy to make the coordinates consistent across different batches, which is a core problem when embeddings are calculated on batches rather than the full graph. This enables scalable training.

- Allowing iterative changes to the graph affinity metric during training via an alignment technique. This enables end-to-end training when features are updated.

- Achieving excellent results on various benchmarks in terms of faithfulness of the embedding, clustering performance, and computational efficiency compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing a batch-trainable spectral graph network module via a direct supervised loss and alignment strategies. This provides an effective differentiable building block that inherits useful properties from spectral graph theory for use in deep learning systems.
