# [OpenCodeInterpreter: Integrating Code Generation with Execution and   Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Open-source code generation models lack execution capabilities and iterative refinement compared to advanced proprietary systems like GPT-4 Code Interpreter. This limits their practical applicability and adoption.

Proposed Solution - OpenCodeInterpreter (\model):
- Family of open-source code systems for generating, executing and iteratively refining code.
- Trained on new 68K multi-turn \dataset dataset with compiler diagnostics and simulated human feedback.
- Uniquely integrates execution feedback and human guidance for dynamic code refinement over multiple turns.

Key Contributions:
- \dataset dataset with 192K turns and extensive feedback mechanisms. Constructed through 5 innovative methods.
- \model systems effectively utilize feedback to correct errors and align solutions with user needs.
- Comprehensive evaluation shows \model-33B matches GPT-4 Code Interpreter at 83.2 avg accuracy on HumanEval/MBPP.
- Further improves to 91.6 with synthesized human feedback, narrowing gap with GPT-4.
- Sets new SOTA for open-source code generation and refinement. Democratizes advanced capabilities.

In summary, the paper introduces \model to address limitations of open-source code models in utilizing feedback. By leveraging the new \dataset dataset and integration of execution and human guidance, \model achieves state-of-the-art performance and elevates open-source systems to be on par with proprietary counterparts. This helps increase accessibility and democratization of such advanced AI coding assistants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes OpenCodeInterpreter, an open-source family of code systems designed for generating, executing, and iteratively refining code, supported by a new multi-turn code instruction dataset Code-Feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of OpenCodeInterpreter (OCI), a family of open-source code systems designed for generating, executing, and iteratively refining code. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes OCI, which integrates execution feedback and human feedback to dynamically refine generated code. This allows OCI to produce solutions that are both technically sound and closely matched to user requirements.

2) The paper constructs a new dataset called Code-Feedback featuring 68K multi-turn interactions between users, code models, and compilers. This dataset is used to train OCI models.

3) Through comprehensive evaluations, the paper shows that OCI-33B achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. It is on par with proprietary systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter.

4) With synthesized human feedback from GPT-4, OCI's performance further elevates, outperforming GPT-4 Code Interpreter on some metrics. This helps bridge the gap between open-source and proprietary code generation systems.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of OCI and its training dataset to advance open-source code generation and refinement using both execution diagnostics and human feedback.
