# [Enhance Sketch Recognition's Explainability via Semantic Component-Level   Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07875)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a structured sketch recognition network with an embedded semantic component-level memory module to enhance the explainability of sketch recognition. The memory module learns feature representations of semantic components and associates strokes with components via a similarity metric. This allows parsing strokes into components in an interpretable way. The fused stroke or component features are fed into a Transformer architecture, which is supervised on segmentation if stroke-level labels are available, or on predicting component existence if only sketch category labels and prior knowledge of component compositions per category exist. This flexibility allows the method to handle datasets with or without stroke-level component labels. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art sketch recognition and segmentation performance. The parsing of strokes into explainable components provides improved model interpretability over existing methods. Key advantages are the ability to explain predictions based on constituent components, flexibility for supervised and weakly supervised settings, and strong quantitative results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a structured sketch recognition network with a semantic component-level memory module to enhance sketch recognition's explainability by parsing sketches into semantic components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A semantic component-level memory module is constructed, which can learn and store memory keys representing semantic components, and do explainable parsing from strokes to components.

2. A structured sketch recognition network is proposed, which has hierarchical and explainable abilities, from stroke-level embedding, component-level parsing to sketch-level recognition. 

3. The proposed network is explainable and flexibility to deal with the sketch recognition situations with or without semantic component labels of strokes, and can achieve remarkable performance on the public datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a structured sketch recognition network with a semantic component-level memory module to enhance the explainability of sketch recognition via parsing sketches into semantic components.
