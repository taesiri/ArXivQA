# [Prototypical Kernel Learning and Open-set Foreground Perception for   Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04952)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve generalized few-shot semantic segmentation (GFSS) by addressing the issues of representation division and embedding prejudice?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Learning prototypical representations for both base and novel classes can help mitigate the representation division issue in GFSS. 2) Learning an open-set foreground perception module can help address the embedding prejudice issue where novel class pixels tend to be misclassified as background.3) Combining prototypical learning and open-set foreground perception through the proposed modules of Prototypical Kernel Learning (PKL), Foreground Contextual Perception (FCP), and Conditional Bias Based Inference (CBBI) can improve performance on GFSS.So in summary, the central research question is how to improve GFSS, and the key hypotheses are around using prototypical learning and open-set foreground perception to address specific challenges like representation division and embedding prejudice. The proposed PKL, FCP, and CBBI modules embody the technical approach to testing these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a prototypical kernel learning method to maintain representation consistency between base classes (learned from abundant data) and novel classes (aggregated from limited samples) in generalized few-shot semantic segmentation (GFSS). 2. It introduces an open-set foreground perception module to mitigate embedding prejudice and prevent novel targets from being misclassified as background.3. It presents a conditional bias based inference to combine the predictions from the prototypical kernel learning and foreground perception modules.4. It extends the method from GFSS to class incremental few-shot segmentation, which handles novel classes in an incremental stream.5. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both GFSS and incremental few-shot segmentation settings.In summary, the key contribution is using prototypical learning and open-set foreground perception to address the issues of representation division and embedding prejudice in GFSS. The method achieves new state-of-the-art results by effectively integrating the knowledge learned from base classes and novel classes.
