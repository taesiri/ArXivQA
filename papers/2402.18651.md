# [Quantifying Human Priors over Social and Navigation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18651)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to quantify human priors (i.e. inherent biases) over relational data such as social and navigation networks. Specifically, it seeks to model the prior probability that humans assign to different possible connectivity patterns when given a set of nodes (people, places, etc) and minimal information about how they are related. This is challenging because the number of possible networks grows extremely rapidly as the number of nodes increases.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop an experimental framework and analysis pipeline to infer these priors. In their online experiments, participants are shown "partial graphs" where some connections between nodes are shown and others obscured. Participants then guess the obscured parts of the network. By aggregating data over many users and networks, fitting a probabilistic model, and using a hierarchical maximum entropy parameterization, the authors are able to infer a smooth, structured prior distribution over connectivity patterns.

Key Contributions:

- A "Markov chain Monte Carlo with people" experimental paradigm to efficiently sample the high-dimensional space of possible networks

- Application of this approach to infer priors over social networks and spatial navigation networks, domains relevant over evolutionary timescales

- Finding that the inferred priors display some consistent traits like favoring sparsity, while other traits like triadic closure are domain-specific to social interactions

- Demonstrating how the combinatorial structure of graphs can be exploited to develop low-dimensional models of distributions over graphs

- Showing how "nonclassical" analysis of indirect behavioral experiments can reveal latent cognitive biases over relational information

The work illustrates how human experiments combined with careful modeling can uncover the efficient coding biases that guide human intuition about relational data.
