# [Quantifying Human Priors over Social and Navigation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18651)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to quantify human priors (i.e. inherent biases) over relational data such as social and navigation networks. Specifically, it seeks to model the prior probability that humans assign to different possible connectivity patterns when given a set of nodes (people, places, etc) and minimal information about how they are related. This is challenging because the number of possible networks grows extremely rapidly as the number of nodes increases.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop an experimental framework and analysis pipeline to infer these priors. In their online experiments, participants are shown "partial graphs" where some connections between nodes are shown and others obscured. Participants then guess the obscured parts of the network. By aggregating data over many users and networks, fitting a probabilistic model, and using a hierarchical maximum entropy parameterization, the authors are able to infer a smooth, structured prior distribution over connectivity patterns.

Key Contributions:

- A "Markov chain Monte Carlo with people" experimental paradigm to efficiently sample the high-dimensional space of possible networks

- Application of this approach to infer priors over social networks and spatial navigation networks, domains relevant over evolutionary timescales

- Finding that the inferred priors display some consistent traits like favoring sparsity, while other traits like triadic closure are domain-specific to social interactions

- Demonstrating how the combinatorial structure of graphs can be exploited to develop low-dimensional models of distributions over graphs

- Showing how "nonclassical" analysis of indirect behavioral experiments can reveal latent cognitive biases over relational information

The work illustrates how human experiments combined with careful modeling can uncover the efficient coding biases that guide human intuition about relational data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a framework to quantify human priors over relational data like social and navigation networks by modeling behavioral experiments as Markov chains with people and using graph cumulants to characterize the inferred priors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a framework to quantify human priors (i.e. implicit biases or assumptions) about the structure of social and navigation networks, using an experimental platform based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with human participants. Specifically, the paper:

- Designed an online experimental platform and cover stories to engage human participants in inferring obscured parts of social networks (e.g. friendships between students) or navigation networks (e.g. trails between locations). 

- Developed a Bayesian data analysis approach that fits participants' responses to a hierarchical maximum entropy model of network structure, in order to estimate human priors over properties like sparsity, degree distribution, and clustering.

- Found that some features of the inferred priors were consistent across domains, like favoring sparsity, while others were domain-specific, like increased clustering in social networks.

- Demonstrated the efficiency of this experimental and modeling framework for quantifying implicit human biases regarding relational data structures.

In summary, the key contribution is using controlled behavioral experiments paired with probabilistic modeling to extract and compare the latent structure of human priors over different types of networks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms are:

- human priors - The paper focuses on quantifying implicit biases or "priors" that humans have regarding networks and relational data.

- relational data - The paper looks specifically at human reasoning about networks and graph-structured data representing relationships between entities.

- graphs - Graphs are used as a mathematical representation of relational data in the paper. The experiments focus on human inferences about obscured parts of graphs.

- inductive biases - The paper discusses how implicit priors guide and constrain human learning and reasoning. Quantifying these "inductive biases" is a main goal.

- social networks - One domain the paper investigates is reasoning about social networks representing relationships between people. This is compared to reasoning about spatial networks.

- navigation networks - The other main domain examined is spatial networks representing navigational relationships and paths. Human reasoning is compared between social and navigation network contexts.

- efficiency - The paper connects the notion of efficient coding in perception/cognition to efficient representations of relational structure that humans have adapted to.

So in summary, key terms revolve around implicit human biases and inferences regarding relational/graph-based data, especially contrasting the social and spatial navigation domains.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that human knowledge is largely implicit and relational. Could you expand more on why modeling implicit relational knowledge is important and the challenges involved?

2. The paper focuses on social networks and navigation networks as domains of interest. Could you discuss other types of relational domains that would be worthwhile to model human priors over using this framework?

3. Could you elaborate on the considerations and tradeoffs involved in designing the "gamified" online experimental platform to engage human participants while also carefully controlling variables?

4. The partial graph generation process forms a Markov chain. What are some ways this process could be adapted to more efficiently or thoroughly sample the space of possible graphs?

5. How was the choice made to use a hierarchical maximum entropy model to parameterize the priors? What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to other possible parameterizations? 

6. What validation procedures were used to ensure the fitted models accurately reflect participants' priors? Could more be done here?

7. The paper argues the results are "remarkably robust" despite the assumptions not holding perfectly in practice. Could you expand on what kinds of violations are likely and how robust the method is to them?

8. What ideas do you have for adapting this approach to model human priors in other complex, high-dimensional spaces like images, text, or audio?

9. The paper hints at cultural differences in navigation vs social network priors. How feasible would it be to quantify differences across cultures and what would we hope to learn?

10. If you could pick one aspect of the method to improve or build upon in future work, what would it be and why?
