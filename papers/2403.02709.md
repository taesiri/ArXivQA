# [RT-Sketch: Goal-Conditioned Imitation Learning from Hand-Drawn Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02709)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Goal-conditioned imitation learning typically relies on language or images to specify goals. However, language can be ambiguous and images can be over-specified. This makes it difficult for robots to interpret goals and act precisely. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using hand-drawn sketches as goals instead. Sketches strike a balance - they are easy for humans to draw on-the-fly like language, but also convey spatial information like images. Additionally, sketch abstraction may help robots ignore distracting, task-irrelevant details in a scene.  

The paper presents RT-Sketch, a goal-conditioned policy that takes a sketch of the desired scene and outputs actions to rearrange objects accordingly. To enable training, the authors use an image-to-sketch translation network to automatically convert images from an existing demonstration dataset into sketches. The policy architecture builds on prior work, with modifications to handle visual instead of language goals.  

Contributions:
- Introduction of hand-drawn sketches for goal-conditioned manipulation
- Method for scalable sketch-trajectory dataset creation 
- Modification of prior architecture for visual goal conditioning  
- Experimental comparison to language and image-conditioned policies
- Results showing RT-Sketch handles varying sketch detail, ignores distractors better than images, and resolves language ambiguity  

In experiments on 6 tabletop manipulation skills with a mobile manipulator, RT-Sketch performs on par with other conditioning approaches on straightforward tasks. When language is ambiguous or distractors are present, RT-Sketch shows higher spatial precision and alignment scores as rated by humans. This demonstrates the utility of sketches for goal-conditioned policies.
