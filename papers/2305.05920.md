# [Fast Distributed Inference Serving for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05920)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve job completion time (JCT) for large language model (LLM) inference serving?

The paper proposes a system called FastServe to address this question. The key ideas are:

- Enable preemptive scheduling at the granularity of output tokens to avoid head-of-line blocking. This is done by exploiting the autoregressive generation pattern of LLM inference.

- Design a skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler that leverages the input length information (which is known a priori) to make better scheduling decisions and reduce demotions. 

- Manage GPU memory efficiently with proactive key-value cache offloading and uploading to support more concurrent inference jobs.

- Support distributed execution across GPUs with extensions to scheduler and cache manager.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that optimizing scheduling and memory management specifically for the characteristics of LLM inference can greatly improve job completion times compared to prior systems. The FastServe system is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for large language models (LLMs) that aims to minimize job completion time (JCT). 

- A skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler that leverages the semi information-agnostic nature of LLM inference (knowing the input length but not output length a priori). It assigns an appropriate initial queue to each job based on its first iteration time.

- A proactive key-value cache management mechanism to efficiently handle the large memory overhead of maintaining intermediate state for preempted jobs. It proactively offloads and uploads cache data to hide data transfer latencies. 

- Supporting distributed execution across multiple GPUs using techniques like tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism. The scheduler pipelines multiple job batches and the cache manager partitions the cache across GPUs.

- Implementing a FastServe prototype and demonstrating up to 5.1x and 6.4x speedup in average and tail JCT respectively over the prior art Orca system in end-to-end experiments.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the design and implementation of FastServe, a distributed serving system tailored to optimize JCT for LLM inference by exploiting its unique properties. The key ideas are the specialized scheduler and proactive cache management.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on distributed inference serving for large language models compares to other related work:

- It focuses specifically on optimizing inference serving for large language models (LLMs) like GPT, which have unique characteristics and challenges compared to serving other types of models. Much prior work on model serving has focused on CNNs and other neural networks.

- It proposes techniques to enable preemptive scheduling and minimize job completion time for LLM inference serving. This is different from most prior systems that use simple FCFS scheduling. The key insight is exploiting the autoregressive nature of LLM inference to enable preemption at the granularity of generating each output token.

- It addresses the GPU memory overhead challenge of preemptive scheduling for LLMs through a novel proactive key-value cache management mechanism. This efficiently handles swapping intermediate LLM states between GPU and host memory.

- It designs a custom skip-join MLFQ scheduler tailored to the characteristics of LLM inference serving, taking into account the variable execution time per iteration.

- It supports distributed execution of very large models like 175B parameter GPT-3 by combining tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism. The scheduler and memory manager are extended to handle distributed serving.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the state-of-the-art in optimizing inference serving systems specifically for large language models. The techniques are novel compared to prior general model serving systems. The evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in job completion times compared to existing systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced scheduling algorithms specifically for LLM inference serving. The skip-join MLFQ scheduler they propose is a first step, but there may be opportunities for more sophisticated schedulers that further optimize for JCT.

- Exploring incremental and partial state saving techniques to reduce the GPU memory overhead of preserving intermediate state for preempted jobs. The key-value cache for LLMs consumes a lot of memory, so more efficient state saving mechanisms could help.

- Supporting serving of even larger LLMs by combining model parallelism techniques like tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism with data parallelism across GPUs/nodes. The authors currently evaluate up to 16 GPUs, but more scale is likely needed for 175B+ models. 

- Reducing overhead and improving efficiency of swapping key-value cache data between GPU and host memory. The proactive caching helps overlap this, but further optimizations in when and how to swap cache data could help.

- Evaluating performance under more diverse workloads and applications. The current evaluation uses synthetic workloads, so testing with real applications could reveal new bottlenecks.

- Comparing end-to-end performance when serving LLMs on other accelerators like TPUs in addition to GPUs. The characteristics of different hardware may enable further optimizations.

In summary, the main future directions relate to developing more advanced scheduling algorithms, reducing memory overhead, supporting larger models, improving efficiency of swapping cache data, evaluating real workloads, and exploring different hardware platforms. Advancing these areas can help further optimize and scale LLM inference serving.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for large language models (LLMs). It exploits the autoregressive pattern of LLM inference to enable iteration-level preemption and uses a novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler to minimize job completion time. The scheduler leverages input length information to assign jobs appropriate initial queues and reduce demotions. The system also includes a proactive key-value cache management mechanism to efficiently handle GPU memory constraints by swapping intermediate states between GPU and host memory. For distributed serving, the scheduler pipelines multiple job batches and the cache manager partitions the cache across GPUs. Experiments show FastServe improves average and tail job completion times by up to 5.1x and 6.4x over the state-of-the-art Orca system for serving large GPT-3 models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. LLMs have unique characteristics compared to other neural networks that introduce challenges for low latency and efficient memory usage during inference serving. Existing systems suffer from head-of-line blocking due to first-come-first-served scheduling and run-to-completion execution. FastServe exploits the autoregressive generation pattern of LLM inference to enable preemption at each output token granularity. It uses a novel skip-join multi-level feedback queue scheduler to minimize job completion time. The scheduler leverages the known input length information to skip queues and reduce demotions. FastServe also employs a proactive key-value cache management mechanism to handle the GPU memory overhead. It proactively offloads inactive cache to host memory and overlaps uploading with computation to hide latency. For distributed serving, FastServe partitions the cache and pipelines multiple batches across GPUs. 

Experiments on GPT-3 models show FastServe improves average job completion time by up to 5.1x and tail latency by up to 6.4x compared to state-of-the-art systems like Orca. The skip-join scheduler brings 3.6-41x speedup over baseline MLFQ. Proactive cache management outperforms baselines by up to 3.5x. The results demonstrate the benefits of FineServe's preemptive scheduling and memory optimizations for low-latency LLM inference serving.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. FastServe enables preemptive scheduling at the granularity of each output token generation during the autoregressive inference procedure of LLMs. It uses a novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler that leverages the known input length to more accurately assign an initial priority queue for each incoming job, while skipping higher priority queues to reduce demotions. FastServe also proposes a proactive key-value cache management mechanism to efficiently handle the GPU memory overhead for unfinished jobs in MLFQ. It proactively offloads/uploads the key-value cache between GPU and host memory to overlap data transfer with computation. For distributed serving, FastServe partitions the model and key-value cache across GPUs and carefully integrates the scheduler and cache manager.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of the paper are:

- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become very popular for interactive AI applications. These applications require low latency (job completion time) for LLM inference serving. 

- Existing systems use simple first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling with run-to-completion execution. This suffers from head-of-line blocking and long job completion times.

- LLM inference has an autoregressive pattern where each iteration generates one output token based on previous tokens. This enables the opportunity for fine-grained, iteration-level preemption. 

- The main problems/challenges are:

1) Unknown job size - the number of iterations is not known ahead of time, so shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) scheduling cannot be directly applied.

2) GPU memory overhead - preemptive scheduling requires maintaining intermediate state for more concurrent jobs, which consumes a lot of GPU memory.

- The paper presents FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for LLMs that addresses these problems through:

1) A skip-join multi-level feedback queue (MLFQ) scheduler that leverages the known input length to set initial priorities and reduce demotions.

2) A proactive key-value cache management mechanism that offloads/uploads cache to hide data transfer latency.

- The main question addressed is how to enable preemptive scheduling to minimize job completion times for LLM inference serving despite the challenges of unknown job sizes and GPU memory constraints.

In summary, the key contribution is optimizing inference serving for modern LLMs throughnovel scheduling and memory management techniques.
