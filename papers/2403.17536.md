# [ILLUMINER: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models as Few-shot Intent   Classifier and Slot Filler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF) are important natural language understanding tasks for task-oriented dialogue systems. However, they typically rely on large amounts of labeled data for supervised training.
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown zero-shot capabilities, but require further fine-tuning and specialization to reach optimal performance. Fully fine-tuning large models is impractical and risks catastrophic forgetting when data is limited.

Proposed Approach 
- The paper introduces ILLUMINER, which leverages instruction-tuned LLMs to frame IC and SF as language generation tasks. 
- SF uses an efficient single-prompt method, unlike prior multi-prompt techniques.
- Additional task/domain-specific fine-tuning is done via parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and IA3 adapters.

Main Contributions
- Exploration of prompt engineering for IC and SF tasks. Much faster prompting approach proposed for SF.  
- Comprehensive analysis of Instruct-LLMs on IC and SF tasks over popular benchmarks like SNIPS, MASSIVE and MultiWoz.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance using less than 6% training data through adapters, outperforming GPT-3.5 and other baselines.
- Extensive ablation studies analyzing impact of model architecture, instruction tuning, adapter methods, label exposure, model size etc.
- Showcased cross-lingual applicability over 5 languages in MASSIVE benchmark.

In summary, the paper demonstrates how instruction-tuned LLMs coupled with efficient adapters can effectively solve few-shot IC and SF, outperforming larger models and joint training methods. The approach offers practical benefits for deployment in task-oriented conversational systems.

The paper introduces ILLUMINER, an approach that frames intent classification and slot filling as language generation tasks for instruction-tuned large language models, demonstrating strong performance with limited training data through parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The introduction of ILLUMINER, an approach for intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF) using instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). ILLUMINER frames IC and SF as language generation tasks for the LLMs.

2. An efficient single-prompt information extraction method for SF, requiring only a single query per utterance instead of multiple queries. 

3. A comprehensive comparison of several Instruct-LLMs on benchmark datasets SNIPS, MASSIVE, and MultiWoz. The results show ILLUMINER outperforms baselines like GPT3.5 and prior work, especially for SF.

4. Demonstration that with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, ILLUMINER achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning using less than 6% of training data.

5. Extensive ablation studies analyzing the impact of different factors like model size, number of fine-tuning examples, instruction tuning, and multilinguality.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of ILLUMINER, an approach leveraging instruction-tuned LLMs for low-resource IC and SF via prompting and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
