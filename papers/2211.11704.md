# [ESLAM: Efficient Dense SLAM System Based on Hybrid Representation of   Signed Distance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11704)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: 

How can neural implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) be incorporated into Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to develop efficient and accurate dense visual SLAM methods?

The key hypotheses of the paper appear to be:

- Representing scene geometry with an implicit Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF), instead of volume density or occupancy, will lead to faster convergence and higher quality reconstruction in a SLAM system.

- Storing features on multi-scale axis-aligned planes, rather than voxel grids, will reduce the memory footprint growth rate from cubic to quadratic as scene size increases, enhancing scalability. 

- Jointly optimizing the feature planes, MLP decoders, and camera poses will enable accurate mapping and tracking without needing pre-trained networks or a complex staged training procedure.

So in summary, the main research question is how to effectively integrate recent advances in neural representation like NeRF into SLAM to get an efficient yet accurate dense visual SLAM system, which they address through their proposed ESLAM model and method. The key hypotheses focus on using implicit TSDF and plane-based features to improve convergence, quality, scalability, and avoid needing pre-training.
