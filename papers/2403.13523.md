# [Have You Poisoned My Data? Defending Neural Networks against Data   Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13523)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data poisoning attacks manipulate the training data to compromise machine learning models. Specifically, clean-label attacks apply small perturbations to training samples without changing their labels. This makes the attacks stealthy and hard to detect.
- Current defenses against such attacks have limitations: some fail to generalize across attack methods, others fail against stronger attacks, impact model performance negatively, or fail when attackers can manipulate more data.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a new defense based on "characteristic vectors" that describe intrinsic properties of data distributions at different layers in a neural network.

- It uses batch normalization statistics over each sample as a proxy to capture distribution shifts caused by poisoning attacks. 

- A centroid is computed for each class over the full training set. The distance between each sample's characteristic vector and all centroid vectors is measured. If a sample's closest centroid differs from its label, it is flagged as poison.

Main Contributions:

- Shows characteristic vectors effectively separate distributions of clean and poisoned data, even for failed poisons that do not affect the model.

- Real poisons converge towards the target class chosen by the attacker in characteristic vector space.

- Defense consistently detects poisons generated by different attack methods and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in attack success rate and test accuracy.

- Works for varying perturbation/poisoning budgets and does not affect model performance negatively.

In summary, the paper presents a novel characterization of data using batch norm statistics that reliably detects data poisoning attacks without limiting model accuracy or failing against stronger attacks. The defense generalizes across attack methods and budgets.
