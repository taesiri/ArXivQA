# [3Doodle: Compact Abstraction of Objects with 3D Strokes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating abstract yet descriptive sketch images from 3D objects is challenging. Hand-drawn sketches are subjective creations that do not strictly abide by 3D geometry. 
- Existing methods have limitations: 2D sketch methods lack view consistency; 3D methods require accurate 3D models like mesh or neural radiance fields, which are often unavailable.

Proposed Solution: 
- Represent sketch strokes with a compact set of 3D geometric primitives - 3D cubic Bézier curves and superquadrics.
- Bézier curves indicate view-independent feature lines. Superquadrics express smooth surface contours from varying views.
- Render the 3D strokes into 2D sketches in a fully differentiable manner using a novel volume density field and differentiable rasterizer.
- Optimize primitive parameters to minimize perceptual losses between rendered sketches and multi-view input images.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to generate expressive 3D sketches from compact primitives optimized from multi-view images.
- Does not require dataset, input image stylization or intermediate 3D reconstruction.
- Expressive sketch generation with highly compact representation (<<1.5kB).
- Fully differentiable pipeline enabling optimization of 3D parameters with perceptual losses.
- Qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows compact yet expressive sketches that maintain view consistency.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to create 3D sketch representations directly from images. The key idea is optimizing compact 3D geometric primitives to render abstract yet descriptive sketch drawings in a consistent manner across views.
