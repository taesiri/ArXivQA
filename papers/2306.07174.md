# [Augmenting Language Models with Long-Term Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07174)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable large language models (LLMs) to memorize and utilize long-term context beyond the fixed-sized inputs they are typically limited to. Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem) which allows LLMs to cache long previous context or knowledge into a non-differentiable memory bank and take advantage of that memory to improve language modeling and understanding. The key ideas are:1) A novel decoupled memory design, where a frozen pretrained LLM encodes context into the memory bank and an adaptive residual side network retrieves and reads from that memory. This avoids the issue of "memory staleness" that arises when using a single model for encoding and reading from memory.2) Efficient adaptation of the frozen pretrained LLM via continual training of the lightweight side network, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. 3) The ability to load various types of long-form text/knowledge into the memory bank depending on the downstream task. The paper evaluates long-context language modeling and memory-augmented in-context learning as key test cases.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that augmenting LLMs with an external long-term memory and an efficient adaptation mechanism will allow them to overcome fixed-length input constraints and better leverage long-range dependencies, improving language modeling and understanding. The proposed LongMem framework is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem) that enables large language models (LLMs) to memorize long historical context and utilize this long-term memory to improve language modeling. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing a novel decoupled neural architecture with a frozen backbone LLM as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual side network as a memory retriever and reader. This decoupled design helps address the memory staleness issue in prior work.- Designing a memory caching and retrieval mechanism that can store unlimited-length past context in a memory bank and retrieve relevant memory to augment future inputs. - Demonstrating the effectiveness of LongMem on long-context language modeling benchmarks like modeling entire books and the ChapterBreak dataset. LongMem substantially outperforms prior methods.- Showing LongMem's ability to cache thousands of demonstration examples in memory for memory-augmented in-context learning, leading to significant improvements on NLU tasks over regular LLM fine-tuning.In summary, the key contribution is developing an effective framework to augment LLMs with long-term memory of past context, leading to gains in long-context language modeling and in-context learning. The proposed decoupled architecture and memory mechanisms are critical to the framework's success.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem) which enables large language models to cache long previous context or knowledge into a non-differentiable memory bank and take advantage of that memory to address issues like memory staleness and input length limits.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:- This paper proposes a new framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem) that enables large language models (LLMs) to memorize long history and utilize long-term context. Other recent work has focused on enabling LLMs to process longer contexts, but is still limited (e.g. 16K token contexts in BigBird). LongMem aims to handle unlimited length contexts.- The core idea is to augment a frozen pretrained LLM backbone with an adaptive residual side network that acts as a memory retriever and reader. This differs from prior work like MemTRM that used a coupled memory design and suffered from memory staleness issues during training. The decoupled design of LongMem avoids this problem.- LongMem is evaluated on long-context language modeling tasks like modeling full books. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ChapterBreak benchmark, significantly outperforming prior long-context models like BigBird.- LongMem is also shown to enable memory-augmented in-context learning by loading many examples into the memory bank. This allows it to overcome the limitation on the number of demonstration examples imposed by a fixed context size. Experiments show benefits for in-context learning on NLU tasks compared to baselines.- Overall, LongMem pushes the boundaries on context lengths compared to prior work, while also introducing a more effective decoupled memory architecture. The results demonstrate improved long-context modeling and ability to exploit long-term memory. This is an exciting direction for enhancing LLMs.In summary, LongMem sets a new state-of-the-art in handling unlimited length contexts for LLMs via an innovative decoupled memory design. It demonstrates strengths in long-document modeling and memory-augmented in-context learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other network architectures for the residual SideNet, such as Transformer variants, to further enhance the memory retrieval and fusion capabilities.- Adapting the model architecture to encoder-only and encoder-decoder Transformer backbones, since the current work focuses on a decoder-only architecture. - Incorporating more input modalities beyond text, such as images, to provide multimodal context in the memory bank.- Reducing the time cost of the token-specific image retrieval process to improve inference efficiency.- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of downstream tasks that require long-term memory, such as dialogue, question answering, and summarization.- Exploring different strategies for encoding, storing and updating the memory bank to optimize long-term memory.- Studying how to determine the optimal memory size and chunk size for different tasks and contexts.- Analyzing what types of long-term knowledge are being effectively captured and utilized from the memory bank.- Investigating mechanisms to deal with noisy or irrelevant information being stored in the long-term memory.In summary, the key future directions are centered around improving the memory-augmentation architecture, expanding to more modalities and tasks, and better understanding the properties and utilization of the long-term memory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem) which enables large language models (LLMs) to memorize long histories beyond their typical fixed-size input limitations. LongMem uses a novel decoupled network architecture consisting of the original backbone LLM frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual side network that serves as a memory retriever and reader. Attention keys and values from the backbone LLM are cached into a long-term memory bank. The side network can then retrieve relevant cached representations to augment the processing of new inputs through a joint attention mechanism. This decoupled design avoids the memory staleness issue faced by prior work. Experiments demonstrate LongMem's effectiveness at long-context language modeling, outperforming baselines on tasks like modeling entire books and a suffix identification benchmark. LongMem also shows significant gains in few-shot in-context learning by caching thousands of demonstration examples. The proposed framework enables LLMs to effectively leverage long-form context and memory.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem) which enables large language models (LLMs) to memorize long previous contexts for improved language modeling. The key idea is to use a frozen pretrained LLM as a memory encoder to extract representations of previous inputs, while training an adaptive residual side network to serve as a memory retriever and reader. This decoupled design avoids the issue of "memory staleness" faced by prior work like MemTRM where the same model is used for encoding and reading from the memory. Specifically, the pretrained LLM encodes previous and current inputs, with attention key-value pairs from a layer cached into memory and decoder state outputs transferred to the SideNet. The SideNet, initialized from the LLM, is trained to retrieve relevant cached key-values as augmentations to attend over along with the current input. This allows tapping into long previous contexts beyond the input length limit of standard LLMs. Experiments show LongMem improves perplexity on long-text language modeling datasets and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChapterBreak benchmark. It also enables augmenting in-context learning with thousands of demonstration examples loaded into memory. Overall, the proposed decoupled memory design helps LLMs effectively leverage long-term memory.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem) that enables large language models (LLMs) to memorize long history beyond their typical fixed-length input limit. It uses a novel decoupled network architecture with the original backbone LLM frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual side network as a memory retriever and reader. Attention key-value pairs from previous inputs are extracted by the frozen backbone LLM and stored in a non-differentiable memory bank. When processing a new input, relevant historical keys and values are retrieved from the memory bank using attention queries from the current input. These retrieved memory augmentations are then fused into the side network's learned hidden states via a joint attention mechanism. By continually training the residual side network on retrieved long-context memory, the pretrained backbone LLM can be adapted to leverage that long-term memory and history to improve its modeling. This allows tapping into the backbone LLM's knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The decoupled design resolves issues with stale memories in coupled designs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is trying to address is the limited input length and inability to leverage long-term context that exists in current large language models (LLMs). Specifically:- LLMs like GPT-2/3 have a fixed input size limit (e.g. 1024 tokens) that prevents them from utilizing rich long-context information from past inputs. This limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios requiring processing long-form text.- Methods to increase context length like sparse attention in "x-formers" still have bounded length limits around 16k tokens. They are not sufficient for book/article length sequences. - Prior work MemTRM also suffers from "memory staleness" during training as cached memory representations become stale/mismatched with the evolving model.To address these limitations, the paper proposes a new framework called Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem). The key question it aims to tackle is:How can we augment existing pretrained LLMs with long-term memory capabilities to allow them to effectively encode, cache, and utilize much longer context sequences for improved language modeling and downstream tasks?The LongMem framework proposes a novel decoupled memory architecture to avoid the staleness issue and enable tapping into long previous context stored in memory.
