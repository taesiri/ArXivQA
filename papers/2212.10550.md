# [InstantAvatar: Learning Avatars from Monocular Video in 60 Seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10550)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we reconstruct high-fidelity, animatable 3D human avatars from monocular video in a highly efficient manner that enables real-time use cases?

The key hypothesis is that by carefully integrating emerging acceleration techniques for neural radiance fields with efficient articulation modules and tailored optimization strategies, it is possible to achieve avatar reconstruction from monocular video that is orders of magnitude faster than prior work while maintaining high quality. 

Specifically, the paper proposes that by combining:

1) An efficient canonical radiance field (Instant-NGP)
2) A fast articulation module (Fast-SNARF)  
3) An empty space skipping scheme tailored for humans
4) Efficient training objectives and regularization 

It is possible to reconstruct animatable avatars from monocular video in just 60 seconds of training time, 130x faster than prior work, while achieving comparable or better reconstruction quality. This enables avatar reconstruction that is fast enough for real-time use cases.

So in summary, the central research question is how to achieve extremely fast avatar reconstruction from monocular video for real-time use. The key hypothesis is that by carefully integrating emerging acceleration techniques with optimizations tailored for humans, this can be achieved.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a system called InstantAvatar that can reconstruct high-fidelity 3D human avatars from monocular video very efficiently. Specifically:

- It can reconstruct animatable avatars from video in just 60 seconds, compared to hours required by prior work. 

- The key ideas are combining an efficient canonical neural radiance field (Instant-NGP) with a fast articulation module (Fast-SNARF) and proposing an empty space skipping scheme tailored for dynamic humans.

- This allows training 130x faster than prior work and achieving comparable or better reconstruction quality when given the same time budget.

- The method enables near-instant avatar learning, producing usable results in as little as 10 seconds of training. 

In summary, the paper makes monocular avatar reconstruction applicable to real-world use cases by designing a highly optimized system that can learn avatars from video in about the same time it takes to capture the video. This is enabled by carefully integrating emerging acceleration techniques like Instant-NGP and Fast-SNARF and proposing innovations like the empty space skipping scheme.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes an efficient system called InstantAvatar that can reconstruct high-quality 3D human avatars from monocular videos in just 60 seconds, enabling real-time avatar creation and animation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on monocular neural avatar reconstruction:

- Speed: The main contribution is a system that can reconstruct animatable avatars from monocular video in just 60 seconds. This is orders of magnitude faster than prior work like Anim-NeRF and Neural Body which take 10+ hours. 

- Quality: The paper shows competitive or even better reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods when trained to convergence. Given equal training time, the proposed method significantly outperforms others.

- Pose synthesis: The paper demonstrates high quality novel pose synthesis, outperforming Anim-NeRF especially for loose clothing. This is likely due to not relying on a fixed body model like SMPL for regularization.

- Approach: The speedup is achieved through a combination of using efficient model components (Instant-NGP, Fast-SNARF), and proposing a new empty space skipping scheme tailored for articulated humans. Prior work focused more on the model architecture itself.

- Data: Evaluation is conducted on established datasets like PeopleSnapshot and SURREAL. Many recent papers create custom datasets which makes direct comparison difficult.

Overall, this paper pushes the boundaries of how quickly high-quality animatable avatars can be reconstructed from monocular video through careful system design and engineering, achieving significantly faster performance than prior art. The quality and pose synthesis results are also competitive or better than existing methods.
