# [Schrodinger Bridges Beat Diffusion Models on Text-to-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03491)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Bridge-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis method built on Schrodinger bridge techniques. Unlike previous diffusion-based TTS systems that generate speech from a noisy Gaussian prior, Bridge-TTS makes the first attempt to replace this prior with a clean and informative one - the text latent representation supervised by ground truth speech. To enable this design, the authors propose a tractable Schrodinger bridge formulation between paired data, allowing flexible choices of noise schedule and revealing novel first-order bridge samplers. Leveraging the tractability and flexibility of this framework, Bridge-TTS explores various aspects of model design and sampling schemes. Experiments on the LJ Speech dataset demonstrate Bridge-TTS significantly outperforms the diffusion-based TTS baseline Grad-TTS in both 1000-step and 50-step synthesis. It also surpasses state-of-the-art fast TTS models in 4-step/2-step scenarios, achieving superior quality with high sampling efficiency. Overall, this work opens a new direction of building generative models using data-to-data process and clean priors to unleash their potential.
