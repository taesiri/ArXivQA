# [Schrodinger Bridges Beat Diffusion Models on Text-to-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03491)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Bridge-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis method built on Schrodinger bridge techniques. Unlike previous diffusion-based TTS systems that generate speech from a noisy Gaussian prior, Bridge-TTS makes the first attempt to replace this prior with a clean and informative one - the text latent representation supervised by ground truth speech. To enable this design, the authors propose a tractable Schrodinger bridge formulation between paired data, allowing flexible choices of noise schedule and revealing novel first-order bridge samplers. Leveraging the tractability and flexibility of this framework, Bridge-TTS explores various aspects of model design and sampling schemes. Experiments on the LJ Speech dataset demonstrate Bridge-TTS significantly outperforms the diffusion-based TTS baseline Grad-TTS in both 1000-step and 50-step synthesis. It also surpasses state-of-the-art fast TTS models in 4-step/2-step scenarios, achieving superior quality with high sampling efficiency. Overall, this work opens a new direction of building generative models using data-to-data process and clean priors to unleash their potential.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel text-to-speech synthesis method called Bridge-TTS that generates mel-spectrograms from clean text latent representations using tractable Schrodinger bridges, achieving state-of-the-art quality and sampling efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. In text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, they make the first attempt to generate the mel-spectrogram from clean text latent representation (the condition information in diffusion counterpart) by means of Schrodinger bridge, exploring data-to-data process rather than data-to-noise process.

2. By proposing a fully tractable Schrodinger bridge between paired data with a flexible form of reference SDE, they theoretically elucidate and empirically explore the design spaces of noise schedule, model parameterization, and sampling process, further enhancing TTS quality. 

3. Empirically, they attain both state-of-the-art generation quality and inference speed with a single training session. In both 1000-step and 50-step generation, they significantly outperform their diffusion counterpart Grad-TTS; in 4-step generation, they accomplish higher quality than FastGrad-TTS; in 2-step generation, they surpass the state-of-the-art distillation method CoMoSpeech and the transformer-based model FastSpeech 2.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel TTS system Bridge-TTS built on data-to-data process via Schrodinger bridge, with superior performance in both quality and speed over previous diffusion-based methods. The tractability of their framework also allows them to explore various design choices to further improve the system.

To summarize, this paper proposes a novel TTS synthesis method called Bridge-TTS, which utilizes a tractable Schrodinger bridge formulation to enable a data-to-data generation process between the text latent representation (as a strong prior) and the target mel-spectrogram. In contrast to previous diffusion-based TTS models that follow a data-to-noise process, this data-to-data bridge provides both higher quality samples and more efficient sampling. The paper also explores design choices around noise schedules, model training, and sampling techniques. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Bridge-TTS over state-of-the-art baselines.
