# [MKF-ADS: A Multi-Knowledge Fused Anomaly Detection System for Automotive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04293)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the increasing connectivity of vehicles to external networks, cybersecurity has become a critical issue for in-vehicle networks (IVNs). Traditional cryptography-based defense mechanisms are computationally demanding and lack backward compatibility. Hence, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have gained traction as an efficient alternative. However, signature-based IDSs cannot detect zero-day attacks and anomaly-based IDSs suffer from high false alarm rates.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Multi-Knowledge Fused Anomaly Detection System (MKF-ADS) that leverages both spatial-temporal and contextual knowledge to accurately detect anomalies in CAN bus communications. 

The key components of MKF-ADS are:

1) Spatial-Temporal Correlation with Attention (STcAM): Uses 1D CNN to extract spatial features, BiLSTM to extract temporal features, and attention to focus on key timestamps.

2) Patch Sparse Transformer (PatchST): Captures long-range dependencies and semantic context from independent univariate time series.  

3) Knowledge Distillation: Transfers contextual knowledge from PatchST (teacher) to STcAM (student) without increasing complexity.

In the detection phase, only the lightweight STcAM is deployed on the resource-constrained IVN. Deviations between predicted and received CAN messages are used to detect anomalies.  

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel knowledge fusion framework to enrich anomaly detection capabilities in IVNs

- Designs a lightweight yet effective STcAM module to extract spatial-temporal correlations  

- Introduces PatchST to complement with contextual knowledge  

- Enables transfer of knowledge via distillation without increasing complexity

- Achieves significantly improved performance - 2.62% error rate and 97.3% F1 score.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing anomaly detection for IVNs by fusing complementary knowledge in an efficient distilled framework.
