# [MKF-ADS: A Multi-Knowledge Fused Anomaly Detection System for Automotive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04293)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the increasing connectivity of vehicles to external networks, cybersecurity has become a critical issue for in-vehicle networks (IVNs). Traditional cryptography-based defense mechanisms are computationally demanding and lack backward compatibility. Hence, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have gained traction as an efficient alternative. However, signature-based IDSs cannot detect zero-day attacks and anomaly-based IDSs suffer from high false alarm rates.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Multi-Knowledge Fused Anomaly Detection System (MKF-ADS) that leverages both spatial-temporal and contextual knowledge to accurately detect anomalies in CAN bus communications. 

The key components of MKF-ADS are:

1) Spatial-Temporal Correlation with Attention (STcAM): Uses 1D CNN to extract spatial features, BiLSTM to extract temporal features, and attention to focus on key timestamps.

2) Patch Sparse Transformer (PatchST): Captures long-range dependencies and semantic context from independent univariate time series.  

3) Knowledge Distillation: Transfers contextual knowledge from PatchST (teacher) to STcAM (student) without increasing complexity.

In the detection phase, only the lightweight STcAM is deployed on the resource-constrained IVN. Deviations between predicted and received CAN messages are used to detect anomalies.  

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel knowledge fusion framework to enrich anomaly detection capabilities in IVNs

- Designs a lightweight yet effective STcAM module to extract spatial-temporal correlations  

- Introduces PatchST to complement with contextual knowledge  

- Enables transfer of knowledge via distillation without increasing complexity

- Achieves significantly improved performance - 2.62% error rate and 97.3% F1 score.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing anomaly detection for IVNs by fusing complementary knowledge in an efficient distilled framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-knowledge fused anomaly detection system (MKF-ADS) for detecting intrusions in automotive controller area networks, which integrates spatial-temporal correlation and contextual knowledge through a student-teacher framework to achieve high detection capability with low complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes a novel neural network CAN anomaly prediction model called MKF-ADS that fuses multiple types of knowledge, including spatial-temporal correlation features extracted by the STcAM module and long time-series historical dependency knowledge absorbed from the transformer-based PatchST module. 

2. It designs a lightweight STcAM module that uses Conv1D to extract spatial features, BiLSTM to capture temporal features, and a soft attention mechanism to focus on important time steps. Meanwhile, PatchST is introduced to capture context features from separated univariate time series.

3. It constructs a multi-knowledge fused framework, regarding STcAM as a student model and PatchST as a teacher model. This allows STcAM to not only learn inherent spatial-temporal knowledge but also mimic the valuable contextual features from PatchST, avoiding conflicts between different knowledge types and improving training stability.

4. It evaluates the prediction and detection performance on six intrusion scenarios and further tests generalization capability on different CAN IDs, multi-time steps, and real-attack tasks. It also discusses the feasibility of applying the model in automotive systems in terms of complexity and efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a knowledge fused anomaly detection system called MKF-ADS that achieves better performance while maintaining efficiency for resource-constrained in-vehicle network environments.
