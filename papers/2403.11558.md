# [Reinforcement Learning with Token-level Feedback for Controllable Text   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional methods for controllable text generation like Bayesian factorization (Eq 1) condition the generation on a high-level control attribute $c$. 
- The paper argues that this condition $c$ should be more fine-grained, denoted as $\hat{c}$, representing the probability that a finished sentence matches the target attribute.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper derives a new Bayesian factorization formulation (Eq 2) that uses the fine-grained condition $\hat{c}$ to calculate a probability shift indicating how much the next token distribution should change to match the target attribute.

- This formulation is optimized through a reinforcement learning approach with a quantile scorer trained to score sentences based on their attribute match. The RL loss balances matching the target quantiles of the scorer (controllability) with fluency.

Main Contributions:
- A new theoretical Bayesian factorization for controllable text generation using a more fine-grained control condition.
- An RL training framework to optimize models based on this formulation, balancing attribute control and fluency.
- Experiments across three text generation tasks demonstrating improved performance over prior state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, fluency and diversity.

In summary, the key innovation is a new theoretical formulation for finer-grained controllable generation, implemented through a practical RL training approach with strong empirical results surpassing prior methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a new Bayesian factorization for controllable text generation that considers a more fine-grained control condition to shift the token probability distribution, and applies this formulation to develop a reinforcement learning framework called TOLE that optimizes control precision and fluency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content in the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a new Bayesian factorization formulation for controllable text generation. Specifically, the key difference compared to prior work is considering the controllable condition $c$ to be more fine-grained, denoted as $\hat{c}$. This allows modeling the probability that a finished sentence generated from a subsentence $y_{\leq t}$ satisfies the desired control attribute $c$. The new Bayesian factorization is shown in Equation 4, which indicates the probability shift.

The paper also provides experimental validation on single-attribute control (sentiment modification), multi-attribute control, and detoxification tasks. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method called TOLE in improving attribute accuracy and text quality over prior approaches.

In summary, the main novelty is the reformulation of Bayesian factorization to enable more fine-grained control, along with experimental evidence showing benefits across diverse text generation tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Bayesian factorization - A statistical technique for controllable text generation where the next token probability is factored into an uncontrolled language model term and a control term.

- Continuous prompts - A method for controllable generation where control instructions are encoded into vector representations that are conditioned on by the language model.

- Attribute classifiers - Discriminator models that are trained to predict attributes like sentiment or topics from text. Used by some controllable generation methods.

- Finetuning - Training technique where the parameters of a pretrained language model are updated on new data to specialize the model. Used by some controllable generation approaches.

- Reinforcement learning - Training paradigm based on maximizing rewards that is used by some controllable text generation methods like QuaRK and the proposed TOLE method.

- Quantile estimation - A technique used by TOLE to convert classifier scores into quantile bins for more reliable reward estimation.

- Multi-attribute control - Controlling text generation on multiple attributes like sentiment and topic simultaneously.

- Identical/cross-domain control - Controlling text generation by mixing prompts from the same or different domains during training.

So in summary, key terms cover the Bayesian factorization formulation, different training techniques like finetuning and RL, quantile estimation, and settings like multi-attribute and cross-domain control.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed fine-grained controllable condition $\hat{c}$ in Equation 2 differ from the traditional controllable condition $c$ in Equation 1? What is the intuition behind modeling a more fine-grained condition?

2. The key difference in the proposed Bayesian factorization derivation is considering a more fine-grained controllable condition. Can you explain in detail the differences between Equations 1 and 2 and how the proposed method transforms the traditional Bayesian factorization? 

3. In Equation 2, the term $\frac{\mathcal{P}(\hat{c}|y_{\leq t})}{\mathcal{P}(\hat{c}|y_{\leq t-1})}$ indicates the probability shift. Can you expand on what this probability shift represents and how it allows better control?

4. The proposed method in Equation 3 involves using a scorer to model $\mathcal{P}(\hat{c}|y_{\leq t})$. What considerations should be made in designing the architecture and training of this scorer? How does it interact with the language model?

5. The method utilizes a quantile-based reward function. Can you explain the motivation behind using a quantile formulation compared to other alternatives? What are the advantages? How is the quantile size $q$ chosen?

6. What is the effect of the KL divergence term weighted by $\alpha$ and the entropy term weighted by $\beta$ in the training loss function? How do these terms tradeoff controllability vs fluency?

7. What modifications need to be made to train this method for multi-attribute control compared to single attribute control? How does the method combine guidance from multiple scorer models?

8. How does the proposed training methodology differ from prior work like PPLM, GeDi, DExpert, etc? What are the limitations of those methods that this method aims to address? 

9. The method relies on reinforcement learning for training. What are advantages of RL compared to other learning paradigms for this controllable generation task? What are potential challenges?

10. The human evaluation results generally validate the automated metrics. However, can you analyze any discrepancies between human ratings and automated metrics? What could explain these?
