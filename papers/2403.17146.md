# [Outcome-Constrained Large Language Models for Countering Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Hate speech online can have negative impacts. Counterspeech has emerged as an alternative approach to mitigate hate speech by directly challenging or responding to it.  
- Existing counterspeech generation methods focus on linguistic attributes of the generated text, but it's unclear if such attributes lead to desired conversation outcomes like de-escalating conflicts.
- The paper investigates methods to generate counterspeech constrained by potential conversation outcomes.

Proposed Solution:
- Model two conversation outcomes with Reddit data - conversation incivility level and hater reentry behavior. 
- Incorporate desired outcomes (low conversation incivility and non-hateful hater reentry) into counterspeech generation using four methods:
   1) Prompt with Instructions 
   2) Prompt and Select 
   3) LLM Finetune
   4) LLM Transformer Reinforcement Learning
- Evaluate using outcome classifiers, metrics like relevance and text quality, diversity and novelty.

Main Contributions:
- First exploration of methods utilizing LLMs to generate counterspeech constrained by potential conversation outcomes.
- Experimentation with four methods to guide LLMs to generate counterspeech leading to specific outcomes.
- Evaluation of differences between counterspeech generated by different guiding methods using diverse metrics.
- Serving as initial exploration to empower LLMs to adjust language generation based on desired conversation outcomes.

The paper makes an important first step towards conditioning counterspeech generation on anticipated conversation trajectories, instead of just linguistic attributes. The experimental results provide insights into effective strategies for guided text generation.
