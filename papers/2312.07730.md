# [Hierarchical Classification of Financial Transactions Through   Context-Fusion of Transformer-based Embeddings and Taxonomy-aware Attention   Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately classifying financial transactions is important for banking applications like driving business decisions and understanding customer needs. 
- Existing standards for identifying merchant business types have limitations - they don't cover many modern business types and merchants can be registered with inappropriate categories.
- Machine learning models can overcome these limitations by learning contextual representations from transaction data to classify them correctly.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Transformer-based neural network model called Two-Headed DragoNet for hierarchical multi-label classification of financial transactions. 
- It takes as input two short text descriptors - merchant name and business activity description. 
- A stack of Transformer encoder layers generates contextual embeddings from the inputs.
- A Context Fusion layer aggregates the embeddings to create a high-level combined representation. 
- Two output classifier heads then predict hierarchical category labels based on a predefined taxonomy with macro and micro categories.
- A Taxonomy Attention layer corrects predictions to enforce taxonomy hierarchy rules.

Key Contributions:
- Novel architecture for hierarchical classification of financial transactions using Transformer networks.
- Context fusion strategy to combine representations from multiple transaction descriptors.  
- Taxonomy-aware attention mechanism to ensure consistency with hierarchical category relationships.
- Evaluation using two real-world financial transaction datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with over 93% F1 score for macro-category prediction and 86% for micro-categories. 
- Proposed model outperforms classical ML methods like SVMs, Random Forests, etc.
- Enforcing taxonomy rules further improves micro-category classification performance.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end deep learning solution for hierarchical multi-label classification of financial transactions, with strong empirical results on real banking data. The context fusion and taxonomy-aware attention are key innovations.
