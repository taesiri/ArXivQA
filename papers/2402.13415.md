# [Structure Guided Prompt: Instructing Large Language Model in Multi-Step   Reasoning by Exploring Graph Structure of the Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13415)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 excel at simple reasoning tasks but struggle with complex multi-step reasoning challenges. This is due to factors like:
   - Natural language contains complex relationships among entities that are difficult to track over longer text spans
   - Linguistic diversity means the same concepts can be expressed in different ways, making it hard to connect related pieces of information
- Graphs are effective at representing relational data and capturing long-term dependencies, but constructing external knowledge graphs is expensive and may overwhelm LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Structure Guided Prompt (SGP), an innovative 3-stage prompting framework to improve the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Key Features:
- Explicitly converts unstructured text into a graph using the LLMs themselves 
- Provides task-specific strategies to guide LLMs in navigating this graph to formulate responses
- Organizes reasoning tasks into categories (relation prediction, entity prediction etc.) based on graph structure
- Experiments with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across diverse reasoning tasks

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the SGP framework that significantly enhances LLM reasoning by exploring graph structure underlying text
- Demonstrates boosted LLM performance across range of natural language reasoning tasks using this framework
- Provides analysis summarizing open questions and insights to inspire future research directions in reasoning

In summary, the paper introduces an effective prompting framework that converts text into graphs to guide LLMs in complex multi-step reasoning across diverse language tasks. By organizing information and directing navigation, it enables LLMs to provide more accurate and context-aware responses even in zero-shot settings.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel three-stage prompting framework called Structure Guided Prompt that converts unstructured text into a graph to guide large language models in enhanced multi-step reasoning across various natural language tasks in a zero-shot setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized into three key aspects:

1. It proposes a novel prompting framework called Structure Guided Prompt (SGP) designed to enhance the reasoning capability of large language models by exploring the graph structure underlying the text. 

2. It shows through experiments that this framework boosts the reasoning capabilities of general-purpose large language models across a broader spectrum of natural language scenarios involving multi-step reasoning.

3. It provides thorough analytical investigations into the performance, summarizing not only the key open questions but also offering valuable insights to inspire further research in enhancing reasoning with language models.

In summary, the key innovation is the SGP framework that converts free text into a graph representation to explicitly guide language models in systematic multi-step reasoning across a diverse range of reasoning tasks. And results demonstrate improved reasoning over state-of-the-art baselines.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions converting unstructured text into a graph via LLMs. What are some of the key challenges in transforming free-form text into a structured graph representation that captures all the semantic relationships accurately? How does the proposed framework address these?

2. The three-stage prompting technique aims to emulate human problem-solving approaches when dealing with relational data. In what ways does explicitly guiding the LLM to construct, plan, and execute align with cognitive theories about how humans tackle problems systematically? 

3. The paper categorizes reasoning tasks into groups aligned with specific graph structures. What are some examples of other reasoning tasks that do not neatly fit into any of the mentioned categories? Would the framework need to be adapted to handle such tasks? If so, how?

4. The task-specific planning stage plays a pivotal role in the overall framework. What are some strategies for automating the design of effective planning techniques instead of manually encoding them? For instance, can we train auxiliary models that specialize in strategic planning?

5. How does the performance vary when using different LLMs within this framework? What architectural attributes or model capacities contribute most to improvements in multi-step reasoning when guided by this approach?

6. The paper focuses primarily on the zero-shot setting without further training. How can the framework be extended into a few-shot learning approach? What benefits would emerge from being able to provide a few examples to adapt the LLM before evaluation?

7. What are some ways to quantify relational complexity and reasoning difficulty when creating benchmark tasks? What measures can supplement overall accuracy to better analyze model capabilities?

8. How does this graph-based prompting framework compare to other structured reasoning techniques like logical inference, Bayesian networks, etc.? What unique advantages does it offer over these approaches?

9. The paper mentions that LLMs often make mistakes when drawing conclusions despite conducting accurate inference. What enhancements can be incorporated to improve the consistency and validity of LLM-generated content?

10. How can we adapt this framework to prompt and enhance reasoning for modalities beyond just text, such as imagery, video, speech, etc.? What modalities offer the most promising avenues for future work?
