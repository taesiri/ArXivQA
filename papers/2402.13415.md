# [Structure Guided Prompt: Instructing Large Language Model in Multi-Step   Reasoning by Exploring Graph Structure of the Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13415)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 excel at simple reasoning tasks but struggle with complex multi-step reasoning challenges. This is due to factors like:
   - Natural language contains complex relationships among entities that are difficult to track over longer text spans
   - Linguistic diversity means the same concepts can be expressed in different ways, making it hard to connect related pieces of information
- Graphs are effective at representing relational data and capturing long-term dependencies, but constructing external knowledge graphs is expensive and may overwhelm LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Structure Guided Prompt (SGP), an innovative 3-stage prompting framework to improve the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Key Features:
- Explicitly converts unstructured text into a graph using the LLMs themselves 
- Provides task-specific strategies to guide LLMs in navigating this graph to formulate responses
- Organizes reasoning tasks into categories (relation prediction, entity prediction etc.) based on graph structure
- Experiments with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across diverse reasoning tasks

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the SGP framework that significantly enhances LLM reasoning by exploring graph structure underlying text
- Demonstrates boosted LLM performance across range of natural language reasoning tasks using this framework
- Provides analysis summarizing open questions and insights to inspire future research directions in reasoning

In summary, the paper introduces an effective prompting framework that converts text into graphs to guide LLMs in complex multi-step reasoning across diverse language tasks. By organizing information and directing navigation, it enables LLMs to provide more accurate and context-aware responses even in zero-shot settings.
