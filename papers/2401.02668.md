# [Towards Integrated Fine-tuning and Inference when Generative AI meets   Edge Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02668)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generative AI (GAI) models like GPT-3 have shown impressive performance but face challenges in further improvement due to limited availability of high-quality public data. On the other hand, edge intelligence (EI) with distributed data and computing capabilities has potential for growth. However, direct knowledge sharing between GAI and EI is hindered due to their contradictory characteristics in parameters size, application domain, architecture, data size and resource provision. Specifically, the uplink knowledge flow from EI to GAI is blocked by limited communication resources to upload exponential edge data, and privacy concerns of sharing local data. The downlink knowledge flow from GAI to EI is blocked as large GAI models have huge computing and memory requirements that exceed edge devices' capacities.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes GaisNet, a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between GAI and EI. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce domain-specific edge models as data-free knowledge relays between GAI foundation models (FM) in cloud and lightweight models on edge devices. This bridges domain-across FM knowledge and domain-specific personalized knowledge.

2) Adopt federated learning between cloud and edge for privacy-preserving knowledge transfer from mass edge data to FM. Adopt split learning between edge and end devices to relay lightweight FM modules for efficient on-device training and inference.

3) Realize integrated fine-tuning and inference of GAI models across the cloud-edge-end hierarchy via the knowledge relays. Fine-tuning aligns FM to domain data and user needs. Inference measures fine-tuning quality and enables value creation. Their integration forms a virtuous cycle.  

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of GaisNet, a novel cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that achieves sustainable co-evolution of GAI and EI via bidirectional knowledge flow.

2) Conceptualization of domain-specific edge models as data-free knowledge relays to resolve GAI-EI contradiction and enable integrated fine-tuning and inference.

3) Analysis of major technical issues in operating GaisNet, including model splitting, client clustering, fine-tuning vs inference tradeoff, and service priority decision.

4) Experiments demonstrating accuracy improvements from pre-training, fine-tuning, client aggregation and integrated tuning & inference.

In summary, this paper explores an innovative direction to synergize centralized GAI and distributed EI via hierarchical collaboration and knowledge sharing. The proposed GaisNet framework can overcome blocking issues and achieve mutual enhancement.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing GaisNet, a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework for integrated fine-tuning and inference of generative AI (GAI) models. Specifically:

1) GaisNet enables bidirectional knowledge flow between GAI and edge intelligence (EI) by using a domain-specific edge model as a data-free knowledge relay. This allows sustainable evolution of GAI models via continuous fine-tuning and application to inference tasks. 

2) The paper proposes and analyzes mechanisms for GAI model fine-tuning using hybrid federated split learning (HFSL) and task inference using split learning (SL) in the GaisNet framework.

3) Experimental results demonstrate the impact of various factors like pre-training, fine-tuning, non-IID data, number of client clusters, and integrated fine-tuning and inference on the performance of GaisNet.

4) The paper discusses major issues and challenges that need to be addressed for effective deployment of GaisNet, such as model splitting, client clustering, tradeoffs between fine-tuning and inference, and service allocation.
