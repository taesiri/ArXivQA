# [Prompting a Pretrained Transformer Can Be a Universal Approximator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14753)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper investigates whether transformers can universally approximate sequence-to-sequence functions when using prompting or prefix-tuning for fine-tuning, without changing any model parameters. Specifically, it examines if arbitrarily modifying model behavior is possible by only prepending a learned prompt/prefix. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper shows that a single transformer attention head is actually capable of universally approximating any continuous function defined on a hypersphere, if used with an appropriate fixed pretrained query/key/value matrices. This surprising expressivity of attention heads for function approximation is proved theoretically. The paper further demonstrates how this single head approximation result can be extended to sequence-to-sequence functions typically seen in NLP tasks.

Key Contributions:

- Proves that a single attention head is a universal approximator for continuous scalar/vector functions on hyperspheres, if used with a suitable fixed pretrained matrix. This is the first such approximation rate result for attention heads.

- Provides concrete bounds on the prompt length needed to approximate functions to a desired accuracy using an attention head. Demonstrates shorter prefixes needed for smoother target functions.

- Shows sequence-to-sequence functions can be approximated by composing single heads through a Kolmogorov-Arnold representation and positional encodings. Requires only transformer depth linear in sequence length.  

- Explains how even transforms pretrained on actual data may leverage combination of element-wise prefix-based maps and pretrained cross-element mixing for modifying behavior.

- Establishes strong approximator abilities for attention heads that previous work has underestimated. Provides better theoretical justification for empirical success of prompting/prefix-tuning methods.

Overall, the paper significantly advances the theoretical understanding of how much model behavior can be changed via prefixing, without updating any parameters. The constructed universal attention head also has interesting safety implications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper shows that with a proper construction, prefix-tuning a single attention head of a transformer model can approximate any continuous function over hyperspheres to arbitrary precision, demonstrating stronger expressiveness than commonly assumed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It shows that a single attention head with a fixed pretrained structure can universally approximate any continuous function on the hypersphere. Specifically, it provides a Jackson-type bound on the length of prefix needed to approximate a target function to a desired precision. 

2. It demonstrates how the result for a single attention head can be extended to show that transformers with depth linear in the sequence length can universally approximate sequence-to-sequence functions through prefix-tuning.

3. It offers an explanation for why prefix-tuning and prompting works well for some tasks but not others. It hypothesizes that these methods modify how individual tokens are processed while relying on the pretrained model for cross-token information mixing. Hence, they can learn new tasks as long as no new attention patterns are needed.

4. Compared to prior work, this paper shows universal approximation can be achieved much more efficiently without relying on memorization of the target function. The constructions have depth independent of the desired approximation accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is providing theory showing transformers can be universal approximators under prefix-tuning, while offering better (lower) bounds on the resources (prefix length) needed to achieve a desired accuracy compared to prior work.

The paper discusses using prompting/prefix-tuning to universally approximate functions with a transformer model. Key results include showing that a single transformer attention head can approximate any continuous function on a hypersphere, giving Jackson-type bounds on the prefix length needed to achieve a desired approximation accuracy, and constructing transformers that can approximate sequence-to-sequence functions using a small number of layers. The analysis relies heavily on mathematical concepts like kernel methods, spherical harmonics, smoothness and continuity of functions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that a single attention head can be a universal approximator when optimized with a prefix. Does this result still hold if we restrict the pretrained components (e.g. key, query, and value matrices) to be low-rank? How does the rank requirement scale with the desired approximation accuracy?

2. The construction in Lemma 3 requires embedding the input $\bm{x}$ in an orthogonal subspace to the control point vectors $\bm{p}_k^\alpha$ and $\bm{p}_k^\beta$. Is there an alternative construction that does not require increasing the hidden dimension? 

3. Theorem 4 provides an asymptotic bound on the prefix length $N$ needed to approximate functions to precision $\epsilon$. Can you prove a non-asymptotic lower bound on $N$? What restrictions need to be placed on the function class $\mathcal{C}$?  

4. The proof technique relies heavily on properties of functions over hyperspheres. What intuition does this provide about why attention may be well-suited for prompt/prefix tuning compared to other architectures?

5. Under what conditions can the result be extended to multi-head attention blocks? Does each head need to satisfy Lemma 3 or can different heads serve different purposes?

6. The paper focuses on continuous functions. What changes need to be made to handle discontinuous/piecewise functions? How does that affect prompt length and transformer depth?

7. Real-world language tasks require modeling complex relationships between input tokens. How can the result for element-wise functions (Corollary 2) be extended to these tasks?

8. What restrictions need to be placed on the pretraining procedure to ensure the existence of a "universal" attention head satisfying Lemma 3? How can we verify this head exists?  

9. The construction relies on very specific position encodings. For tasks that do not use position encodings, how can relative position relationships be modeled instead?

10. The paper shows density results, but the provided bounds suggest prompting/prefix tuning may be less sample efficient than gradient-based fine-tuning. Can the construction be improved to have better sample complexity?
