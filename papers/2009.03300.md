# [Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The paper does not seem to explicitly state a central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus of the paper appears to be evaluating the breadth and depth of language understanding capabilities of current state-of-the-art natural language processing models. Specifically, the paper introduces a new benchmark consisting of 57 different tasks spanning various academic disciplines and professional fields. The goal is to use this benchmark to assess how capable the latest models are at acquiring and applying knowledge and reasoning skills from pre-training on large text corpora. The authors test several models, including GPT-3 and UnifiedQA, on this massive multitask test and analyze their performance across the different tasks.While there is no single clearly defined research question, the overarching goal seems to be using the new benchmark to systematically probe the limits of existing models when it comes to learning and demonstrating understanding across diverse real-world subjects beyond just linguistic skills. The paper aims to identify strengths, weaknesses, and blind spots of current models through their aggregate performance on this expansive test suite.
