# [Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The paper does not seem to explicitly state a central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus of the paper appears to be evaluating the breadth and depth of language understanding capabilities of current state-of-the-art natural language processing models. Specifically, the paper introduces a new benchmark consisting of 57 different tasks spanning various academic disciplines and professional fields. The goal is to use this benchmark to assess how capable the latest models are at acquiring and applying knowledge and reasoning skills from pre-training on large text corpora. The authors test several models, including GPT-3 and UnifiedQA, on this massive multitask test and analyze their performance across the different tasks.While there is no single clearly defined research question, the overarching goal seems to be using the new benchmark to systematically probe the limits of existing models when it comes to learning and demonstrating understanding across diverse real-world subjects beyond just linguistic skills. The paper aims to identify strengths, weaknesses, and blind spots of current models through their aggregate performance on this expansive test suite.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the introduction of a new benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the breadth and depth of language models' understanding across a diverse set of academic and professional subjects. The key points about the benchmark seem to be:- It consists of 57 tasks spanning subjects in the humanities, social sciences, STEM, and other areas. This provides much more breadth than existing benchmarks focused on linguistic understanding or commonsense reasoning. - The questions range from high school level to advanced professional exams to test different levels of difficulty. This provides more depth than benchmarks focused just on elementary commonsense.- Models are evaluated in a zero-shot or few-shot setting without task-specific fine-tuning. This tests how well models can extract and apply knowledge purely from pretraining, rather than relying on spurious cues in a training set.- The benchmark methodology removes the need for massive training sets and enables evaluating models on many diverse topics. This is a shift from the paradigm of models learning from identically distributed train/test sets.The authors use the benchmark to evaluate various language models and find that current models still struggle at many of the tasks, especially those requiring calculations or socially important knowledge. The benchmark helps diagnose these blindspots. Overall, the massive scale and diversity of the benchmark provides a more comprehensive way to measure models' real-world language understanding.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a multitask benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding in AI systems. Here are some key ways it compares to other research on evaluating AI capabilities:- Scope: It covers 57 diverse academic and professional subjects, making it much broader than most prior benchmarks which focus on common sense or linguistic tasks like GLUE. This allows assessing more complex reasoning.- Methodology: Unlike most benchmarks that provide training and test sets, it evaluates models in zero-shot and few-shot settings to better mimic real world learning. This prevents models from relying on dataset biases. - Findings: It reveals that even huge 175B parameter models struggle on many subjects, whereas prior benchmarks saw rapid superhuman performance. This suggests those benchmarks were limited.- Insights: By testing many skills, it clearly shows lopsided capabilities and blindspots like law and ethics. This enables pinpointing weaknesses to prioritize.- Impact: The diversity and difficulty of subjects could make this an enduring goalpost tracking progress. Many prior benchmarks were quickly solved in under a year.Overall, by comprehensively testing real-world knowledge and skills, this benchmark advances evaluation methodology and provides clearer insights into model strengths and limitations compared to prior work focused on narrow linguistic tasks. The scope and difficulty of subjects assessed raises the bar for language understanding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:- Developing models with multimodal understanding beyond just text, such as understanding images, audio, and physical interactions. They suggest a "Turk Test" benchmark involving multimodal tasks on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk.- Improving models' ability to efficiently extract and apply knowledge from diverse online sources during pretraining. The current paradigm of training and testing on identically formatted datasets should shift towards more realistic pretraining followed by evaluation on out-of-distribution examples. - Addressing important weaknesses identified by the multitask benchmark, including improving performance on calculation-heavy subjects like physics and math, and socially important topics like law and ethics. Simply scaling up existing models likely won't be enough.- Making models better calibrated and able to accurately judge what they do and do not know. The largest GPT-3 model was frequently overconfident and miscalibrated.- Developing more sample-efficient learning techniques so models can learn specialized topics without needing exponentially more data.- Evaluating whether weaknesses are due to architectural constraints of autoregressive models like GPT-3 versus limitations in the pretraining process.In summary, the authors call for more multimodal and sample-efficient models that can acquire both broad knowledge and deeper mastery of individual skills and subjects. Their benchmark provides a challenging testbed for assessing progress in these directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new benchmark to evaluate the multitask accuracy of text models across a diverse range of real-world subjects. The benchmark consists of 57 tasks covering topics in STEM, humanities, social sciences, and other branches of knowledge. The 15,908 multiple choice questions range in difficulty from elementary to advanced professional levels. The authors find that most recent models like GPT-3 perform close to random chance, while the 175 billion parameter GPT-3 model achieves 43.9% accuracy. However, GPT-3's performance is lopsided, with near 70% accuracy on its best task but near random performance on the worst tasks. The authors observe especially poor performance on calculation-heavy subjects like physics and math as well as socially important topics like law and ethics. They argue the benchmark can identify blindspots in models to gain a clearer picture of capabilities. The test methodology uses few-shot learning without task-specific fine-tuning, enabling evaluation across an expansive set of diverse real-world subjects.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new benchmark to measure the multitask accuracy of text models across a diverse range of subjects. The benchmark consists of 57 tasks covering topics in STEM, humanities, social sciences, and other areas. The questions were collected from freely available online sources such as practice exams. In total there are over 15,000 questions split into development, validation, and test sets. The paper evaluates several state-of-the-art models on the benchmark, including GPT-3 and UnifiedQA. They find that model performance is very lopsided, with accuracy ranging from near random chance to 70% on the best task. GPT-3 reaches 43.9% average accuracy, outperforming smaller models that are near chance levels. However, it lags well behind human expert performance. The models particularly struggle on calculation-heavy STEM tasks and socially important topics like law and ethics. The paper demonstrates the value of a massive multitask benchmark for analyzing model capabilities across many subjects and pinpointing important weaknesses.
