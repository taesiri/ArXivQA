# [Scalable Higher-Order Tensor Product Spline Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Generalized additive models (GAMs) with tensor product splines (TPS) are powerful non-parametric regression methods. However, they have scalability issues with higher-order TPS due to the exponential increase in computational cost in terms of runtime and memory when increasing the number of features $p$. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes additive factorization machines (AFMs) and additive higher-order factorization machines (AHOFMs) to approximate TPS models in a scalable way by factorizing the TPS coefficients using latent factors. This leads to linear runtime and memory costs in $p$ for a chosen spline basis dimension $M$.

- AFMs approximate bivariate TPS by factorizing the coefficients into univariate components. A key result is that all univariate basis functions only need to be evaluated once per feature for AFMs, significantly reducing storage costs.

- AHOFMs generalize AFMs for multivariate TPS of order $D$ using a recursive definition of additive higher-order terms based on Vieta's formula. AHOFMs retain the linear complexity in $p, M$ and require evaluating univariate bases only once per feature.

- Homogeneous penalization for smoothness is derived to penalize all TPS equally without added cost by exploiting the concept of degrees of freedom. An optimization routine based on stochastic gradient descent is proposed.

Key Contributions:

- Novel AFMs and AHOFMs for scalable non-linear interaction modeling with complexity linear in $p$ and $M$
- Efficient computation by requiring only univariate spline evaluations 
- Meaningful homogeneous penalization for higher-order TPS
- Strong empirical performance showing approximation quality, scalability and competitiveness to state-of-the-art on benchmarks

Overall, the paper makes TPS modeling feasible for problems with many features by proposing interpretable and scalable factorization machines that retain flexibility of non-linear interactions.
