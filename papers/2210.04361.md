# [Iterative Convex Optimization for Model Predictive Control with   Discrete-Time High-Order Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04361)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Safety is a fundamental challenge in control theory and robotics. Using model predictive control (MPC) with continuous-time control barrier functions (CBFs) can enforce safety constraints, but has limitations in prediction due to lack of future state information. 
- Using discrete-time CBFs (DCBFs) in MPC can incorporate future state information over a horizon, but has challenges in computational complexity, optimization feasibility, and being limited mainly to relative-degree one CBFs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel iterative convex optimization approach for MPC with discrete-time high-order CBFs (DHOCBFs) to address the above limitations. 
- At each iteration, the nonlinear dynamics and DHOCBF constraints are linearized to obtain a convex finite-time constrained optimal control problem. This iterative procedure converges to a locally optimal solution.
- Slack variables are introduced to relax the DHOCBF decay rates to enhance feasibility. The method can handle CBFs of any relative degree.

Main Contributions:
- Presents an MPC strategy to enforce safety using DHOCBFs of arbitrary relative degree, overcoming limitations of previous methods.
- Proposes an iterative framework where dynamics and constraints are linearized in each step, enabling a convex optimization solved efficiently. 
- Shows through a unicycle model that the proposed method is significantly faster than baseline nonlinear MPC-DHOCBF, while maintaining safety and feasibility.
- Provides a general formulation for high-order DHOCBFs and their linearization suitable for the iterative optimization approach.
- Analyzes the iterative convergence, effect of hyperparameters, computation time and feasibility via numerical experiments.

In summary, the paper makes central contributions in developing an iterative convex optimization approach for efficient and safe MPC with general DHOCBF constraints to overcome limitations of existing methods. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through application to a unicycle model.
