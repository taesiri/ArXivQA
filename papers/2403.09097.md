# [AI on AI: Exploring the Utility of GPT as an Expert Annotator of AI   Publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Identifying AI research publications is challenging due to lack of clear, widely-accepted criteria or taxonomy. Manual annotation is costly and definitions vary across cultures/languages. 
- Existing methods have limitations - relying on specific venues or keywords risks missing relevant cross-disciplinary research. Unsupervised methods like topic modeling lack transparency.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage crowd-sourced expert labels from arXiv as ground truth data to train classifier. Treats author assignments as expert labels, capturing evolution of field over time.  
- Evaluate utility of LLMs like GPT as expert annotators via prompt engineering. Design prompts with increasing levels of expertise and considerations around uncertainty.

Experiments:
- SciBERT and SPECTER models trained on arXiv data achieve 96% accuracy in classifying publications. SPECTER selected as best model.
- GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 tested on labeling sample of arXiv data. Best prompt achieves 94% accuracy with clarity around uncertainty.
- GPT used to label 76K publications from OpenAlex to generate new training set. Classifier trained on this matches arXiv classifier.

Contributions:
- Framework to evaluate chatbots as expert annotators via prompt design and model performance
- Leverage crowd-sourced labels from authors over time to capture evolution of AI field  
- Show GPT models can reliably label expert-level tasks. GPT-labeled classifier outperforms arXiv baseline.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the proposed solution using chatbots and crowd-sourced labels, the experimental setup and results, and the main contributions made in the paper.
