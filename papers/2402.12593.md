# [Standardize: Aligning Language Models with Expert-Defined Standards for   Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12593)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Domain experts in fields like engineering and healthcare follow strict content standards and guidelines, but current controllable text generation methods do not leverage these expert-defined standards as references for control.  

- There is a need for new approaches to align language models with expert standards to generate high-quality, standard-compliant content.

Solution - "Standardize" Framework:
- Proposes a retrieval-based in-context learning framework to guide language models to align with expert-defined standards such as CEFR and CCS for education content generation.

- Extracts target specifications from prompts to lookup relevant information from the standard, retrieves matching aspects/characteristics.

- Augments knowledge by transforming retrieved info into "knowledge artifacts" (aspect info, exemplars, linguistic variables) that represent the standard's information.

- Integrates artifacts into the language model's generation process via prompting to produce standard-aligned content.

Contributions:
- Formalizes the task of standard-aligned content generation (Standard-CTG).

- Demonstrates Standardize framework improves alignment of Llama2 and GPT-4 with CEFR/CCS standards, increasing precise accuracy by 40-100%.

- Shows incorporating standards' information as knowledge artifacts is crucial for prompting models to generate better standard-compliant content.

- Provides strong baselines using Llama2 and GPT-4 for Standard-CTG task with widely adopted CEFR and CCS standards.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework called Standardize that improves the quality and standard-alignment of language model text generation by extracting, retrieving, and augmenting key knowledge artifacts from expert-defined standards.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing the \textsc{Standardize} framework, which is a retrieval-style in-context learning-based framework that aims to guide large language models to align with expert-defined standards for content generation tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes extracting knowledge artifacts from standards such as aspect information, exemplars, and manually crafted linguistic variables to improve the performance of generative language models in producing standard-aligned content. The framework is evaluated on two widely used academic standards - the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and Common Core Standards (CCS) - for the task of open-ended story generation. The key findings show that models can gain significant performance improvements in generating content aligned to the target standards by using the \textsc{Standardize} framework.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Standard-aligned content generation (\textsc{Standard-CTG}) - A new task formalizing the challenge of generating text using language models aligned with expert-defined standards.

- \textsc{Standardize} - A proposed retrieval-based framework using in-context learning to extract knowledge artifacts from standards to improve language model performance for content generation.

- Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) - An international standard used for assessing general language competencies that is explored in the paper.

- Common Core Standards (CCS) - Academic standards developed for the US K-12 curriculum that is also explored.  

- Knowledge artifacts - Concepts extracted from standards to augment prompts, including aspect information, exemplars, and linguistic variables.

- Llama2 and GPT-4 - State-of-the-art language models evaluated on the proposed \textsc{Standard-CTG} task using CEFR and CCS standards.

- Alignment metrics - Metrics used to evaluate model alignment with standards, including precise accuracy, adjacent accuracy, distributional densities, and closeness.

The key focus seems to be on aligning language models with expert-defined standards for content generation using the proposed \textsc{Standardize} framework and knowledge artifacts. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new task called Standard-CTG. What is the motivation behind formalizing this new task and what are the key differences compared to existing text generation tasks?

2. The Standardize framework involves a 3-step process - target specification extraction, specification lookup and retrieval, and knowledge augmentation. Can you explain each of these steps in more detail and how they allow the integration of standards into the text generation process? 

3. The paper extracts "knowledge artifacts" from the standards to improve text generation. It mentions aspect information, exemplars, and linguistic variables. Compare and contrast how each of these artifacts provides different types of information to guide the models.

4. Table 1 shows sample specifications from CEFR and CCS standards. Choose one aspect from each standard and analyze the type of information it provides models for text generation. How might this information be represented for integration into the models?

5. The linguistic variables used to control text complexity seem quite simple (e.g. average sentence length). Do you think more complex syntactic or semantic variables could also be extracted and represented for finer-grained control? Explain.  

6. The paper evaluates both open and closed models like Llama, GPT-4 etc. What are the key strengths and limitations you might expect from evaluating both model types? Would you recommend any additional models to analyze?

7. Apart from accuracy, the paper also analyzes fluency, diversity and closeness to gold standard data. Why are these additional evaluation dimensions important for understanding how well models align to expert standards?

8. The results show accuracy gains across models when using the Standardize framework. Analyze these gains - are there any patterns across model types, tasks or specific artifacts that provide insights into what works best?

9. The discussion section mentions personalization and global applications as future opportunities. Outline how the Standardize framework could facilitate personalized content generation tailored to individual needs.  

10. A limitation mentioned is dependence on English language data and standards. Propose ways in which this approach could be adapted to other languages and localized standards for text generation.
