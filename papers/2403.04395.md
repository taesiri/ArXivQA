# [SGNet: Folding Symmetrical Protein Complex with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting the structure of large homo-oligomeric (made of multiple identical proteins) protein complexes is challenging. These complexes often exhibit internal symmetry, posing issues due to:
  1) Very long sequences making computation infeasible
  2) Supervision ambiguity in label assignment during training due to identical subunits

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a framework called Symmetry Generator Network (SGNet) to model protein-protein interactions in symmetrical assemblies.

- It conducts feature extraction on a single subunit using evoformers, then generates the whole assembly using a symmetry module. This alleviates issues with long sequences.

- The symmetry module predicts:
  1) Nearest relative position maps to provide symmetry information 
  2) Chain index segmentation masks to distinguish chains
  3) Symmetry type classification score

- Custom symmetry generators are designed to reconstruct the whole assembly for different symmetry types (Cyclic, Dihedral, Tetrahedral etc.) based on predicted interfaces.

- Modeling objectives are designed consistently to avoid supervision ambiguity.

Main Contributions:
- Unified representation of symmetry relations using relative position maps
- Symmetry module to generate the complete symmetrical protein assembly from a single subunit
- Symmetry generators that can model all global symmetry types in proteins
- A framework (SGNet) for predicting quaternary structures of symmetrical protein complexes achieving better performance than baseline

In summary, the paper presents a specialized deep learning framework to effectively predict the structure of large symmetrical protein complexes by modeling symmetry relations and interactions. The two-stage approach overcomes issues related to long sequences and supervision ambiguity.
