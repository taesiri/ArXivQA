# [Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer for Under-Display Camera Image   Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05906)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer for Under-Display Camera Image Restoration":

Problem:
- Under-display cameras (UDCs) allow for full-screen displays by hiding the front-facing camera under the display. However, light passing through the display panel causes image degradation such as blur, noise, and color distortion in UDC images.
- Existing UDC image restoration methods using CNNs do not fully capture the global color offsets and blur kernels needed to restore UDC images. Transformers can capture global contexts but also introduce redundant information and noise.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer (SGSFormer), an asymmetric U-net architecture, for UDC image restoration.
- They introduce sparse attention blocks to filter out redundant information/noise and concentrate on relevant features guided by instance segmentation maps. This segmentation guided sparse attention enhances reconstruction.  
- They alternate segmentation guided sparse transformers and dense transformers to consider both global contexts and local details.
- They design a lightweight segmentation guided sparse transformer for the encoders to avoid over-constraining the encoding process.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of segmentation guided sparse attention which uses instance segmentation features to guide the sparse attention to focus on relevant regions.
- Design of an alternating sparse/dense transformer paradigm to balance global and local contexts for reconstruction.
- Asymmetric U-net architecture catering to different requirements of encoder, decoder and latent blocks. 
- State-of-the-art performance on UDC image restoration benchmarks, with especially high perceptual similarity.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative sparse transformer approach guided by instance segmentation to effectively restore degraded images from under-display cameras. The proposed SGSFormer outperforms previous methods on public datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for restoring high-quality images from Under-Display Camera degraded images, which utilizes sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and incorporates instance segmentation maps to guide the sparse attention to focus on relevant regions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes Segmentation Guided Sparse Attention, which utilizes instance segmentation features as guiding information to enhance the performance of sparse self-attention. 

2. It proposes an asymmetric U-net network architecture called SGSFormer that accommodates various processes within the network by employing Transformer blocks with different structures - encoder blocks with lightweight Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformers, latent blocks with dense Transformers, and decoder blocks with alternating Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformers and Dense Transformers.

3. It demonstrates through experiments that the proposed SGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in restoring images degraded by under-display cameras.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of instance segmentation guidance into a sparse Transformer architecture specifically designed for under-display camera image restoration. Both the segmentation guidance and the hybrid sparse/dense Transformer design help improve performance.
