# [CRNNet: Copy Recurrent Neural Network Structure Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health record (EHR) coding is challenging, with prior work focusing on multi-label classification. However, these methods don't consider complicating diseases (diseases caused by other diseases). 
- Identifying complicating diseases is important for tasks like billing, disease detection, etc. But existing methods don't focus on detecting complicating diseases.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CRNNet, a novel framework to identify complicating diseases in EHR coding. 
- It uses a path generator based on LSTM to generate a sequence of ICD codes for an EHR. A copy module is introduced to leverage information from previous codes to detect complicating diseases.  
- An adversarial learning strategy with a path discriminator is used to guide the training. The path discriminator evaluates each path and provides a reward signal.

Main Contributions:
- First framework focused specifically on detecting complicating diseases in EHR coding.
- Novel path generation approach using LSTMs and a copy module to identify complications.
- Adversarial learning strategy to better train the path generator using rewards from the discriminator.
- Extensive experiments show CRNNet achieves 57.3% complication ratio, much higher than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to detect complications.
- Ablation studies validate the copy module and adversarial learning are crucial to identifying complications.

In summary, the key innovation is a path generation framework leveraging LSTMs, a copy mechanism and adversarial learning to focus specifically on the problem of detecting complicating diseases in EHR coding. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in complications detection over existing approaches.
