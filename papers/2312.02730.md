# [Towards Measuring Representational Similarity of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02730)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores measuring the representational similarity of large language models (LLMs) to better understand differences between models beyond just architectures and benchmark performances. The authors focus on studying similarity of representations in the last layer, as this implies functional similarity in outputs while also providing insight into how models generate those outputs. Using a set of 11 freely available 7B parameter LLM models, the authors apply several representational similarity measures on two datasets - Winogrande for commonsense reasoning and HumanEval for code generation. The results reveal significant differences between some models, suggesting representations are not universal across current LLM models. This limits the generalizability of studies on individual models. The analysis also uncovers discrepancies between similarity measures, highlighting the need to use multiple measures to avoid false conclusions. Additionally, similarity patterns differ substantially between the two datasets, emphasizing that similarity claims are application-dependent. Overall, this preliminary analysis identifies representational differences between LLMs as well as challenges that need to be addressed to reliably compare LLMs. The findings motivate further research to better understand model similarities and differences across a broader range of models, tasks, and methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper measures the similarity of representations of a set of 7B parameter language models on commonsense reasoning and code generation tasks, identifying substantial differences between some models as well as challenges in reliably quantifying similarity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper makes first steps towards understanding the similarity of representations of large language models (LLMs) by:
1) Outlining how representational similarity measures can be applied to measure the similarity of LLMs (Section 2).
2) Presenting initial empirical results showing the representational similarity of a set of 11 LLMs with around 7B parameters on two datasets - Winogrande for commonsense reasoning and HumanEval for code generation (Section 3). The results suggest some models have significant differences in their representations.
3) Identifying several challenges when using representational similarity measures to understand LLM similarity, including discrepancies between measures, task/data dependency of similarity assessments, and difficulty of interpretation (Section 3).

In summary, while providing a preliminary analysis of similarity for some LLMs, the paper mainly contributes by framing the problem of studying LLM similarity and highlighting important open challenges that need to be addressed in future work to gain a reliable understanding.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Representational similarity
- Model comparison/similarity
- Invariances (orthogonal transformation, isotropic scaling, translation)
- Measures (Orthogonal Procrustes, Aligned Cosine Similarity, Norm RSM-Difference, Jaccard Similarity, RSA, CKA)
- Symmetries
- Benchmark datasets (Winogrande, HumanEval)
- Model architectures (decoder-only)

The paper focuses on measuring the representational similarity of large language models, specifically recent decoder-only models with around 7 billion parameters. It uses different representational similarity measures that have certain invariance properties to compare the representations of these models on two benchmark datasets. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the similarities and differences between these large language models beyond just their architectures and high-level performances.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that understanding similarities and differences between large language models (LLMs) is highly desirable. What are some of the key benefits or use cases that would arise from having a better understanding of LLM similarities and differences?

2. The paper focuses on representational similarity of the last layer of LLMs. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using the last layer representations compared to other layers? How might using other layers provide complementary insights?

3. The paper applies representational similarity measures that make assumptions about deterministic representations and exact correspondence between rows. How do the solutions proposed in the paper, such as only comparing last token representations, address those assumptions? What other solutions could be explored? 

4. Several representational similarity measures are used in the experiments. What are the key differences between these measures in terms of their mathematical formulation? How do these differences lead to differing insights about LLM similarities?

5. The results show discrepancies between similarity measures even when they share the same invariances. What might explain these discrepancies theoretically? How could an analysis into the causes of discrepancies be conducted?

6. Task/data dependency of similarity scores is demonstrated in the results. What are some hypotheses for why similarity differs across the tasks studied? How could the impact of different data distributions or tasks be analyzed further?

7. What other datasets beyond the two used could provide useful insights into LLM similarities? What considerations should guide selection of datasets for similarity analysis?

8. The limitations discuss the potential issue of overfitting for small datasets. What solutions could address this limitation while still allowing the use of benchmarks? How could overfitting be detected and quantified?

9. The paper studies a specific set of 7B parameter models. How could an analysis be conducted on the impact of model size on similarity? Would we expect patterns to generalize across model sizes?

10. Prompting format is raised as something that could impact similarities. Whatkinds of prompting analysis could shed light on this issue? Could prompts be designed to maximize or minimize model similarities?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are now many large language models (LLMs) with impressive capabilities, but little is known about how similar or different they are beyond high-level architecture and performance comparisons. 
- Gaining a better understanding of LLM similarities and differences has many benefits such as simplifying model selection, detecting potential illegal model reuse, advancing knowledge of factors behind strong performance, etc.
- Prior work studying LLM similarity is limited and has focused more on smaller BERT-style models rather than modern decoder-only models at scale.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores using representational similarity measures to compare internal representations of various LLMs as a way to assess similarity. 
- Specifically, it looks at representation from the last decoder layer before final output layer.
- A set of measures are selected that have invariance to rotations/reflections, scaling, and translation of representations.
- Preprocessing steps are taken to address non-determinism of representations and differing tokenization.

Experiments:
- 11 LLMs with ~7B parameters are compared on Winogrande (commonsense reasoning) and HumanEval (code generation) datasets.
- Analysis shows significant differences between some models, significant discrepancies between similarity measures, and task-dependent nature of similarities.
- Challenges are highlighted around interpretation of scores, risk of false conclusions, etc.

Main Contributions:
- First empirical assessment of representational similarities between modern LLMs at scale.
- Demonstrates feasibility of applying similarity measures to LLMs. 
- Identifies several challenges that suggest need for careful study to avoid inaccurate judgments of similarity.
- Lays groundwork and motivation for future research into better understanding internals of large language models.
