# [TAP4LLM: Table Provider on Sampling, Augmenting, and Packing   Semi-structured Data for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09039)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TAP4LLM, a versatile pre-processing framework to improve large language models' (LLMs) effectiveness on tabular reasoning tasks. TAP4LLM has three core modules - table sampling, table augmentation, and table packing. Table sampling selects the most relevant rows and columns from large, noisy tables to feed into the LLM. Table augmentation enhances the sampled table by incorporating external knowledge and metadata using methods like retrieving relevant Wikipedia pages or defining unfamiliar terms. Table packing serializes the table into a sequence prompt while controlling the token allocation between the condensed table and augmented information. Across six datasets over question answering and fact verification, TAP4LLM boosts LLM accuracy by 7.93% on average, demonstrating the benefits of strategic pre-processing. The paper also provides empirical analysis on the performance trade-offs of different setups within TAP4LLM to serve as a guideline for optimal utilization. In summary, TAP4LLM advances LLM-based tabular reasoning via interpretable preprocessing to extract salient information, augment semantics, and strategically pack sequences.
