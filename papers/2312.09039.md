# [TAP4LLM: Table Provider on Sampling, Augmenting, and Packing   Semi-structured Data for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09039)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TAP4LLM, a versatile pre-processing framework to improve large language models' (LLMs) effectiveness on tabular reasoning tasks. TAP4LLM has three core modules - table sampling, table augmentation, and table packing. Table sampling selects the most relevant rows and columns from large, noisy tables to feed into the LLM. Table augmentation enhances the sampled table by incorporating external knowledge and metadata using methods like retrieving relevant Wikipedia pages or defining unfamiliar terms. Table packing serializes the table into a sequence prompt while controlling the token allocation between the condensed table and augmented information. Across six datasets over question answering and fact verification, TAP4LLM boosts LLM accuracy by 7.93% on average, demonstrating the benefits of strategic pre-processing. The paper also provides empirical analysis on the performance trade-offs of different setups within TAP4LLM to serve as a guideline for optimal utilization. In summary, TAP4LLM advances LLM-based tabular reasoning via interpretable preprocessing to extract salient information, augment semantics, and strategically pack sequences.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reasoning over tabular data using large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to three main issues: (1) Long tables exceed the token limitations of LLMs, and truncation loses vital contextual information. (2) Raw tables lack explanatory metadata and external knowledge required for complex reasoning. (3) Effective prompt engineering must balance table content with augmented knowledge under a constrained token budget.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes TAP4LLM, a pre-processing framework to enhance LLM reasoning over tabular data. It contains three modules:

(1) Table Sampling: Selects the most relevant rows/columns from large tables to fit LLM token constraints based on rules or semantic similarity to the query.

(2) Table Augmentation: Enhances the table by extracting metadata (e.g. field types) or retrieving relevant external knowledge (e.g. definitions) to provide better context.  

(3) Table Packing: Serializes the table and packs it with augmented knowledge into the prompt using markup languages like HTML while optimizing the token allocation.

Key Contributions:
- Systematic study of diverse sampling, augmentation and packing techniques for tabular reasoning. The combined TAP4LLM framework improves accuracy by 7.93% on average.
- Formulation of guidelines on optimal configurations of TAP4LLM components for different scenarios. 
- Analysis of trade-offs between model performance versus token budget when tuning table content versus augmentation.
- Proposition of an interactive language-driven system between applications and large language models to enable seamless table reasoning.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive pre-processing solution to address challenges in applying large language models for reasoning over tabular data across diverse tasks. The techniques and insights provide a valuable framework to enhance language model interpretation of structured data formats.

The paper proposes a framework called "TAP4LLM" with three core modules - table sampling, table augmentation, and table packing. It utilizes these modules to improve the effectiveness of large language models in reasoning over tabular data. The sampling methods extract the most relevant parts of large tables, while augmentation incorporates additional knowledge from external sources. Packing then serializes the table into sequences and balances token allocation. Through comparative experiments over datasets, the paper demonstrates significant accuracy improvements from using this table provider framework. The concepts of interactive table reasoning and optimizing prompt engineering for structured data reasoning are also key themes.
