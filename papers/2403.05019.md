# [ERASOR++: Height Coding Plus Egocentric Ratio Based Dynamic Object   Removal for Static Point Cloud Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05019)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The presence of dynamic objects in 3D point cloud maps generated from LiDAR scans can introduce distortions and long traces, negatively impacting mapping accuracy and navigation. Existing methods for removing dynamic objects have limitations in accuracy, efficiency, or applicability.  

Proposed Solution - ERASOR++:
The paper proposes ERASOR++, an enhanced dynamic object removal approach, building upon the previous Egocentric RAtio of pSeudo Occupancy-based method (ERASOR). The key contributions are:

1. A novel Height Coding Descriptor (HCD) combining height difference and layer occupancy information to represent vertical point cloud columns more descriptively.  

2. A Height Stack Test (HST) leveraging HCD's layer information to accurately assess if a column contains dynamic points, avoiding erroneous removal.

3. Additional tests - Ground Layer Test (GLT) to identify ground layer for HST, and Surrounding Points Test (SPT) to correct isolated incorrect dynamic classifications.

Together, these enhance ERASOR's capability to precisely distinguish and remove only true dynamic points while preserving static environment structure, even in complex unstructured scenes.

Evaluation:
Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate ERASOR++ significantly improves dynamic point classification accuracy over ERASOR, increasing static point Preservation Rate by up to 9.5% while maintaining high dynamic point Rejection Rate. It also matches ERASOR's efficiency. Ablations validate each new technique's contribution.

In summary, ERASOR++ advances the state-of-the-art in map point cloud dynamic object removal through novel descriptor and classification enhancement techniques. The descriptive HCD formulation also promises applicability to other 3D perception challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an enhanced approach called ERASOR++ that introduces a Height Coding Descriptor to represent point clouds along with Height Stack Test, Ground Layer Test, and Surrounding Points Test methods to effectively identify and remove dynamic objects from LiDAR point clouds for improved static metric mapping.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel Height Coding Descriptor (HCD) to represent point cloud information in a more descriptive yet concise way by combining height difference and height layer encoding. 

2) Introducing the Height Stack Test (HST) method to more accurately evaluate dynamic bins using the encoded height information from HCD, avoiding potential bad removal issues.

3) Adding the Ground Layer Test (GLT) and Surrounding Point Test (SPT) methods to further improve the accuracy of identifying dynamic points.

4) Demonstrating superior performance over the previous ERASOR method in terms of higher precision (measured by metrics like Preservation Rate and F1 score) as well as comparable efficiency.

In summary, the key contribution is an enhanced dynamic object removal approach called ERASOR++ that leverages the proposed techniques like HCD and HST to overcome limitations of prior arts and achieve better accuracy and robustness in removing dynamic objects from LiDAR point cloud maps.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Dynamic object removal - The main focus of the paper is developing methods to remove dynamic objects from LiDAR point cloud maps.

- Height Coding Descriptor (HCD) - A novel representation proposed in the paper that encodes both height difference and layer occupancy information to describe point clouds.

- Height Stack Test (HST) - A proposed method to evaluate if a point cloud bin contains dynamic objects by analyzing the overlap in layers above the ground between current and prior maps. 

- Ground Layer Test (GLT) - A method to identify the layer corresponding to the ground plane points within the HCD.

- Surrounding Points Test (SPT) - A proposed technique to correct potential errors in identifying isolated dynamic bins by analyzing surrounding bins.

- Preservation Rate (PR) - A metric used to evaluate the ability of methods to preserve static/non-dynamic points. 

- Rejection Rate (RR) - A metric used to evaluate the ability of methods to reject/remove dynamic points.

In summary, the key focus is on LiDAR-based mapping and developing improved techniques to remove dynamic/moving objects from maps while preserving the static background structure. The methods leverage information in the vertical direction rather than rely on visibility assumptions.
