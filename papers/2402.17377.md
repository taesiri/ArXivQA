# [KoDialogBench: Evaluating Conversational Understanding of Language   Models with Korean Dialogue Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17377)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation methods to assess language models' conversational capabilities in Korean, which is a low-resource language. Most existing dialogue benchmarks focus on English and Chinese.

- This hinders the development of adept conversational agents for Korean, which is important as conversational models are often deployed as chatbot assistants that interact with users in their native language.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new benchmark called "KoDialogBench" specifically designed to evaluate the conversational proficiency of language models in Korean.

- KoDialogBench consists of 21 test sets covering two primary tasks: dialogue comprehension and response selection. The test sets are derived from public Korean dialogue corpora or translated from English/Chinese corpora.

- The dialogue comprehension task aims to assess understanding of various semantic/pragmatic aspects in a dialogue, using auxiliary tasks like topic classification, emotion recognition, fact identification etc.

- The response selection task evaluates how well models can choose an appropriate next response from candidates, allowing analysis based on metadata like topic, number of speakers etc.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale Korean conversational benchmark tailored to assess language models. Enables in-depth evaluation and analysis.

- Extensive experiments using KoDialogBench highlighting limitations of current models including poor cross-lingual transfer of instruction tuning methods. 

- Analysis showing importance of training with Korean text - multilingual LMs perform worse than Korean-focused LMs. Fine-tuning specifically on Korean further helps.

- Results reveal most models underperform humans significantly, offering diagnostic insights into areas needing improvement for developing adept conversational agents in Korean.

So in summary, KoDialogBench allows holistic evaluation of conversational abilities of LMs in Korean using multifaceted dialogue tasks. It provides analysis-driven insights to advance Korean conversational agents.
