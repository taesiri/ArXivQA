# [IOI: Invisible One-Iteration Adversarial Attack on No-Reference Image-   and Video-Quality Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
No-reference (NR) image and video quality metrics are increasingly used to benchmark video processing algorithms. However, the robustness of learning-based NR metrics against adversarial attacks has not been widely studied. To exploit vulnerabilities in NR metrics for cheating in video processing benchmarks, attacks need to be fast, imperceptible and temporally consistent when applied to videos. Prior attack methods on NR metrics fail to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces a fast and imperceptible one-iteration (IOI) adversarial attack to increase NR image and video quality metrics. The key components are:

1) One-iteration setup to ensure high attack speed. The attack calculates gradients and perturbs images/frames using only one access to the NR metric model.

2) Frequency module to transform images to frequency domain and inject perturbations mainly into high frequencies, making them less perceptible. 

3) Weighting module to suppress perturbations in smooth image regions by weighting perturbations based on local variance.

Together these components enable IOI attack to craft fast, imperceptible and temporally stable adversarial videos.

Contributions:

- Proposes IOI attack that increases NR metrics scores with one model access per image/frame to ensure high speed.

- Introduces frequency and weighting modules for imperceptibility and temporal stability when attacking videos.  

- Compares IOI against 8 prior attacks using image and video quality metrics. IOI achieves superior visual quality at matched speed and attack strength.

- Validates IOI attack via crowdsourced subjective study with 685 participants. IOI videos showed significantly better perceptual quality over prior attacks.

The IOI attack enables evaluating vulnerabilities in NR metrics. It also highlights the need for developing robust learning-based NR video quality models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Invisible One-Iteration adversarial attack method that efficiently generates imperceptible and temporally consistent perturbations to increase the scores of no-reference image and video quality assessment metrics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an Invisible One-Iteration (IOI) adversarial attack that increases no-reference image- and video-quality metrics scores. The attack produces perturbations that are imperceptible and temporally stable in videos, while being fast since it works in one iteration.

2. It proposes a methodology for comparing adversarial attacks on no-reference quality metrics. The methodology aligns attack speed and relative metric increase to allow comparing only the objective and subjective quality of adversarial videos. 

3. It conducts comprehensive experiments using two datasets and three no-reference models, evaluating the proposed and eight prior attacks. The results demonstrate the IOI attack generates adversarial images and videos of superior quality compared to prior methods.

4. It validates the results with a subjective study on 685 participants. The study confirms the IOI attack produces adversarial videos with better visual quality than previous methods.

In summary, the main contribution is an imperceptible, temporally consistent, fast one-iteration adversarial attack on no-reference quality metrics that generates perturbations of superior objective and subjective quality compared to prior attacks.

The paper introduces an adversarial attack method called "Invisible One-Iteration" (IOI) that can imperceptibly perturb images and videos to increase the scores of no-reference quality metrics. Key aspects of the method include using frequency and weighting modules to hide the perturbations, requiring only one fast iteration for the attack, and achieving high attack success in terms of increasing quality scores while maintaining high perceptual quality based on both objective and subjective comparisons. The goal is to generate attacks that are invisible, temporally consistent across video frames, and fast enough to integrate into video processing pipelines.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a frequency module and a weighting module to enhance the visual quality of adversarial images/videos. Could you explain in more detail how these two modules work and how they contribute to making the perturbations less perceptible? 

2. You mention that your attack method runs for only one iteration. What is the rationale behind choosing a one-iteration attack over an iterative attack with multiple small steps? How does this contribute to the speed of your method?

3. You introduce a new metric called adversarial mean absolute error (MAE*) to measure the difference between attacked and original images/frames in the frequency domain. What are the advantages of using this metric over traditional Lp norms for regulating visual distortions?

4. The paper claims the method is "invisible" to the human eye. Could you elaborate on the subjective testing methodology used to validate this claim? What metrics or procedures were used to assess the perceptual quality?

5. How does your weighting module for guiding perturbations compare to prior weighting methods like normalized variance weighting (NVW)? What enhancements did you make to the variance-based weighting approach?

6. You mention temporal stability of videos as an essential evaluation criterion. How do you ensure the attack produces smooth, flicker-free videos over time? What measures or constraints are imposed for inter-frame consistency?

7. The paper focuses exclusively on no-reference image quality metrics. Do you think the attack would also succeed against full-reference metrics? What challenges might arise in that scenario?

8. Under what conditions might your attack method start to introduce visible artifacts in images or temporal flickering in videos? Are there any failure modes or scenarios you identified where it breaks down?

9. Have you explored any defenses against your proposed attack method, such as adversarial training or video purification? How robust is the approach to different countermeasures?

10. The method is presented in a white-box threat model where the attacker has full access to the victim model. How difficult would it be to extend your approach to a black-box scenario with limited knowledge of the target model?
