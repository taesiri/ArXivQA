# [ORC: Network Group-based Knowledge Distillation using Online Role Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01186)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we effectively leverage multiple teacher networks for knowledge distillation while avoiding the transfer of "false knowledge" from immature/underperforming teachers?

The key hypotheses/claims of the paper are:

- Using all teachers simultaneously can lead to false knowledge transfer from immature networks, hampering student learning. 

- Dividing teachers into "teacher group" and "student group" based on performance, and only allowing top students to become "temporary teachers", can avoid this issue.

- Their proposed "Online Role Change" (ORC) strategy, with intensive/private/group teaching phases, allows effective knowledge transfer from mature to immature networks while preventing false knowledge transfer.

- Their experiments show ORC outperforms regular multi-teacher and online distillation methods, demonstrating it enables effective use of multiple networks for distillation without false knowledge issues.

In summary, the central research question is how to leverage multiple networks for distillation without immature networks contaminating the knowledge - and their proposed ORC strategy and associated hypothesis is their way of addressing this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a novel multiple network-based knowledge distillation method using an online role change (ORC) mechanism. 

- It divides the multiple networks into a teacher group and a student group, and promotes the top-ranked student network to a temporary teacher role during training to avoid transferring false knowledge from immature networks.

- It introduces three teaching methods - intensive, private, and group teaching - to enable successful online knowledge transfer via ORC. 

- Intensive teaching uses error samples from the student group to help the pivot teacher focus on what the students are struggling with. 

- Private teaching helps refine the knowledge of promoted temporary teachers. 

- Group teaching transfers the collaborative knowledge from the refined teacher group to the student group.

- It shows superior performance over other knowledge distillation methods on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed online role change strategy and teaching methods for multiple network knowledge distillation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective online role change mechanism during multiple network knowledge distillation to avoid false knowledge transfer, along with teaching methods tailored for this strategy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from this paper: 

This paper proposes a novel online knowledge distillation method that divides networks into teacher and student groups, promotes top-performing students to temporary teachers, and uses intensive teaching on error samples, private teaching to refine temporary teachers, and group teaching to transfer collaborative knowledge while preventing false knowledge transfer.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in knowledge distillation:

- This paper focuses on using multiple teacher networks for knowledge distillation, which is an active area of research. Other works like DML, ONE, and KDCL also explore using multiple peer networks. 

- A unique aspect of this paper is dividing the networks into teacher and student groups and allowing online role changes between the groups during training. Other methods like KDCL train all networks jointly without distinct roles.

- The online role change strategy aims to prevent transferring false knowledge from immature teachers. This is a key problem the paper tries to address compared to prior multi-teacher distillation methods.

- The proposed intensive, private, and group teaching methods are designed specifically to enable effective online role changes and collaborative teaching. These teaching techniques seem novel compared to prior work.

- The paper shows strong results on CIFAR and ImageNet benchmark datasets, outperforming existing knowledge distillation methods like AT, RKD, CRD, and KDCL. This demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed techniques.

- The method is evaluated on various network architectures (ResNets, WRN, VGG, MobileNets) showing its general applicability, similar to some other distillation papers.

In summary, the key novelties of this paper compared to related work seem to be the online role change strategy, separation into student/teacher groups, and teaching techniques to support collaborative distillation. The impressive results demonstrate these are effective extensions over prior multi-teacher distillation techniques.
