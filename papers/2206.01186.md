# [ORC: Network Group-based Knowledge Distillation using Online Role Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01186)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we effectively leverage multiple teacher networks for knowledge distillation while avoiding the transfer of "false knowledge" from immature/underperforming teachers?The key hypotheses/claims of the paper are:- Using all teachers simultaneously can lead to false knowledge transfer from immature networks, hampering student learning. - Dividing teachers into "teacher group" and "student group" based on performance, and only allowing top students to become "temporary teachers", can avoid this issue.- Their proposed "Online Role Change" (ORC) strategy, with intensive/private/group teaching phases, allows effective knowledge transfer from mature to immature networks while preventing false knowledge transfer.- Their experiments show ORC outperforms regular multi-teacher and online distillation methods, demonstrating it enables effective use of multiple networks for distillation without false knowledge issues.In summary, the central research question is how to leverage multiple networks for distillation without immature networks contaminating the knowledge - and their proposed ORC strategy and associated hypothesis is their way of addressing this problem.
