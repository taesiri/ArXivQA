# [SynFundus: Generating a synthetic fundus images dataset with millions of   samples and multi-disease annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00377)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces SynFundus-1M, a novel synthetic fundus image dataset comprising over 1 million images annotated with 15 diseases/pathologies. It leverages a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model trained on a private dataset of over 1.3 million images to generate highly realistic synthetic fundus photos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the authenticity of SynFundus images, with ophthalmologists unable to reliably discern them from real images. Quantitative evaluation using Fr√©chet Inception Distance shows SynFundus-1M's superior quality compared to existing datasets and other generative models. Downstream experiments highlight models pretrained on SynFundus-1M converge faster and outperform those using ImageNet on disease classification tasks. Rigorous protocols are instituted to guarantee privacy preservation and prevent identifiable information leakage from the private training data. Notable applications include more accurate AI screening systems and reduced data collection burdens for medical imaging research. Limitations exist in generating images of conditions with subtle or localized manifestations. Overall, as the most expansive annotated fundus image collection publically available, SynFundus-1M promises to spur breakthroughs in ophthalmologic AI and medical imaging.
