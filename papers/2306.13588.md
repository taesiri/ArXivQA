# [System-Level Natural Language Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13588)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can we aggregate instance-level natural language feedback to make system-level design decisions that improve language generation systems?The paper proposes a framework to derive a small set of criteria (i.e. system-level feedback) from a large set of instance-level natural language feedback. This system-level feedback is then used to design language model prompts to refine model responses across examples, as well as define new metrics to measure improvements aligned with user needs. The paper demonstrates this framework through two case studies of improving the query generator and response generator of an information-seeking dialog system. The results suggest that system-level feedback alone, as well as combining it with instance-level feedback, can lead to measurable improvements in dialog systems based on the designed metrics.In summary, the central hypothesis is that aggregating instance-level feedback to make high-level system design decisions is an effective way to improve language generation systems. The case studies provide evidence to support this hypothesis.
