# [DolphCoder: Echo-Locating Code Large Language Models with Diverse and   Multi-Objective Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code large language models (Code LLMs) have shown impressive performance on code-related tasks. However, existing instruction tuning approaches have two main weaknesses:
   1) They only consider a single correct answer, ignoring diversity of potential solutions.  
   2) Models can generate plausible code but struggle to identify subtle errors.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces DolphCoder, a diverse instruction model with self-evaluation for code generation. It has two main components:
   1) Diverse Instruction Tuning (DIT): Uses different ChatGPT prompts to elicit multiple chain-of-thought answers per instruction. This increases diversity and reasoning paths.
   2) Multi-Objective Tuning (MOT): Added a code evaluation objective to traditional instruction tuning. Training model to both generate and evaluate code is beneficial.  

Key Contributions:
- DolphCoder outperforms strong baselines like CodeLLama and WizardCoder on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks.
- Key findings:
   1) Increasing diversity of responses and reasoning paths boosts code capability of LLMs
   2) Improving ability to evaluate code correctness also enhances ability to generate correct code.

In summary, the paper introduces a new diverse instruction tuning method with self-evaluation that achieves state-of-the-art performance. The key ideas are increasing diversity of solutions and combining code generation with code evaluation objectives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces DolphCoder, a diverse instruction model with self-evaluating for code generation that learns diverse instruction targets and combines a code evaluation objective to enhance code generation ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. It introduces a diverse instruction model (DolphCoder) with self-evaluating for code generation. Specifically, it learns diverse instruction targets by using different system prompts and combines a code evaluation objective to enhance its code generation ability. 

2. DolphCoder outperforms strong open-source code LLMs by a large margin, including CODELLAMA-INSTRUCT, OctoCoder, and WizardCoder. For example, on the HumanEval benchmark, DolphCoder-7B achieves 62.8 pass@1, outperforming WizardCoder-7B by 14.6 absolute points.

3. The key findings of this paper are: (1) Augmenting more diverse responses with distinct reasoning paths increases the code capability of LLMs. (2) Improving one's ability to evaluate the correctness of code solutions also enhances their ability to create correct code.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the DolphCoder model which introduces diverse instruction tuning and multi-objective tuning to enhance code generation performance. DolphCoder demonstrates state-of-the-art results on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a diverse instruction model (DolphCoder) with self-evaluating for code generation. Could you elaborate more on why augmenting more diverse responses increases the code capability of language models? What is the reasoning behind this?

2. The Diverse Instruction Tuning (DIT) method uses different system prompts to generate more diverse code solutions. How did the authors devise these system prompts? What considerations went into designing effective prompts to elicit distinct reasoning paths? 

3. The paper finds that continually increasing the number of system prompts provides diminishing performance gains. What underlying redundancy issues cause this effect? How could the diversity-based compression methods mentioned help address this?

4. For the Multi-Objective Tuning (MOT) method, what other approaches did the authors try to obtain training data besides using GPT-4? What were the limitations that made GPT-4 the chosen approach?

5. The accuracy of GPT-4 code evaluation is only about 79.4%. How does this noise in the training data affect MOT? What methods could help improve automatic code evaluation to strengthen MOT?  

6. The paper shows MOT primarily augments the model's ability to distinguish responses rather than directly improving solution robustness. Why does distinction help preference for the correct answer? How else could solution robustness be improved?

7. The case study highlights how DolphCoder handles boundary cases more robustly than baseline models. To what extent can the improvements be attributed to each of DIT and MOT? How do they interact?

8. For the ablation studies, how sensitive is overall performance to the mix of DIT and MOT data? Were any curriculum learning strategies explored? 

9. The paper focuses on smaller 7B/13B CODELLAMA models. Would the conclusions generalize to larger foundation models? What adjustments might be needed?

10. Beyond correctness, how well does DolphCoder optimize for properties like efficiency, clarity, conciseness, and documentation? What further objectives could help optimization along these dimensions?
