## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Domain Prompt Learning with Quaternion Networks":

Problem:
Most advanced vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP are designed for natural images and struggle when adapting to specialized domains like remote sensing or medical images. While large-scale domain-specific foundation models can help, they only pre-train at the vision level lacking support for prompting vision-language pairs. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes using quaternion networks to transfer the recognition abilities of VLMs from general to specialized domains by incorporating domain-specific knowledge from foundation models. Specifically, domain-specific vision features from the foundation models guide the transformation of the generalized contextual embeddings from the VLM's language branch into a specialized space within the quaternion networks. This allows mining the domain-specific cross-modal relationships to specialize the language branch. Then the vision-language matching relationships in VLMs are utilized to hierarchically forward domain-specific information from the specialized language branch into the vision branch.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces quaternion networks into prompt learning to transfer VLMs to specialized domains using domain-specific foundation models
- Mines intermodal relationships between domain-specific vision features and VLM contextual embeddings to project embeddings into the specialized space
- Propagates domain-specific information hierarchically from specialized language branch into vision branch for domain-specific contrastive learning
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on domain-specific datasets like remote sensing and medical images, demonstrating the effectiveness for domain prompt learning

In summary, the paper leverages quaternion networks and domain-specific foundation models to successfully prompt the adaptation of general VLMs to specialized domains, overcoming their limitations in areas like remote sensing and medical imaging. Both the vision and language branches are specialized via hierarchical propagation of domain information mined through intermodal relationship modeling.
