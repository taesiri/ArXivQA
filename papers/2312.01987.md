# [Bootstrapping SparseFormers from Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01987)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to efficiently "bootstrap" SparseFormers, a variant of vision transformers that uses significantly fewer tokens, from large-scale pre-trained vision models like AugReg and CLIP. The key idea is to inherit most of the pre-trained weights from the foundation models into the SparseFormer architecture, only training the lightweight focusing transformer that adjusts token regions of interest. With minimal tuning, the SparseFormer output can be aligned to the original model's output using an ImageNet-1K sample set, without needing labels. Experiments show bootstrapped 49-token SparseFormers can reach 84.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy while being over 3x faster, almost matching the teachers they bootstrap from. The method works for dense prediction too, with bootstrapped SparseFormers reaching 51+ mIoU in segmentation. Notably, bootstrapping from CLIP without any text enables strong zero-shot transfer to vision-language tasks. Additionally, bootstrapped SparseFormers can directly replace vision encoders in multimodal models like LLaVa without re-tuning language components. Overall, the bootstrap technique enables efficiently training performant SparseFormers for both vision and vision-language tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to efficiently bootstrap SparseFormers, a sparse vision transformer architecture, from large-scale pre-trained vision models by inheriting most of their weights while only training a lightweight focusing transformer to align the representations with much fewer tokens.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to efficiently "bootstrap" SparseFormers from large-scale pre-trained vision foundation models. Specifically:

- They propose to bootstrap SparseFormers by inheriting most of the pre-trained weights from foundation models like ViTs and CLIP, and only training the SparseFormer-specific components like the focusing transformer. This allows SparseFormers to leverage the capabilities of large foundation models without costly end-to-end training.

- They demonstrate bootstrapping SparseFormers for both unimodal models like AugReg ViTs and multimodal models like CLIP. The bootstrapped SparseFormers achieve strong performance on tasks like image classification and retrieval while using much fewer tokens and FLOPs.

- They show the bootstrapped SparseFormers can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal settings, by incorporating them into models like the LLaVa language model without any fine-tuning. They maintain strong language-vision capabilities but with fewer visual tokens as input.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective and efficient method to bootstrap SparseFormers from foundation models, allowing them to inherit pretrained capabilities while being computationally cheaper.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- SparseFormer - The sparse vision transformer architecture that is being bootstrapped in this work. It uses fewer tokens and adjustable regions of interest (RoIs) to focus on foreground objects.

- Bootstrapping - The process of inheriting weights from pre-trained vision foundation models into SparseFormers and aligning the representations with fewer tokens.

- Foundation models - Large-scale pretrained models like AugReg and CLIP that serve as a strong initialization for downstream tasks. They bootstrap SparseFormers from these. 

- AugReg - The self-supervised classification models pretrained on ImageNet-21K that they bootstrap unimodal SparseFormers from.

- CLIP - The contrastive vision-language model that they bootstrap multimodal SparseFormers from by aligning visual representations without any text.

- Token reduction - SparseFormers can be seen as a method for reducing the number of tokens in vision transformers. Key terms around this.

- Efficient vision transformers - Goal of SparseFormers is to serve as an efficient alternative to standard vision transformers in terms of compute and memory.

The key focus areas are sparse vision transformers, bootstrapping them from foundation models, and using them as efficient alternatives to standard vision transformers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes bootstrapping SparseFormers from vision foundation models. Could you elaborate more on why this bootstrapping approach is more effective and efficient compared to training SparseFormers from scratch?

2. When inheriting weights from vision foundation models, the paper truncates some leading blocks, tunes some middle blocks, and freezes other ending blocks. What is the intuition and ablation results behind this design choice?

3. How does the proposed bootstrapping method differ from common knowledge distillation approaches? What are the advantages of using representation alignment over distillation losses?

4. The pixel-level projection method for segmentation using SparseFormers seems simple. Is there room for improvement in this projection design to further enhance dense prediction performance? 

5. Could the proposed bootstrapping framework be extended to bootstrap efficient models beyond SparseFormers? For example, bootstrapping other token reduction methods like DiffTokens or AttentionTokens?

6. The paper shows strong zero-shot retrieval results by bootstrapping from CLIP. Does this indicate SparseFormers may serve as better alignment models between vision and language compared to dense transformers?

7. How does the token layout and adjustment process in bootstrapped SparseFormers qualitatively differ from the original SparseFormers? Do the visualizations provide any interesting insights?

8. What are other potential large language models that bootstrapped SparseFormers could be directly incorporated into, beyond LLaVa discussed in the paper?

9. What quality metrics beyond FLOPs and number of parameters determine the efficiency of Vision Transformers? How do bootstrapped SparseFormers perform on those metrics?

10. What are limitations of the proposed bootstrapping framework? When would training SparseFormers from scratch be preferred over bootstrapping?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViTs) require a lot of compute and memory due to the quadratic computation cost of the attention mechanism with respect to the number of tokens. This limits their scalability and efficiency.
- Training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive and it is hard to scale them up in terms of model capacity and performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a simple yet effective method to "bootstrap" SparseFormers from large-scale pre-trained vision models like AugReg and CLIP by inheriting most of the pre-trained weights.
- Align the final latent representation from SparseFormers to match that of the teacher vision model using a cosine embedding loss, without the need for any labels during this bootstrapping.
- Only tune a moderate number of initial blocks in the SparseFormer while freezing the majority of the inherited weights to preserve the structure of the output space.

Main Contributions:
- Show that competitive SparseFormers can be bootstrapped from vision models like AugReg and CLIP within only a few hours using ImageNet-1K, without labels. 
- The bootstrapped 49-token SparseFormer achieves 84.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, reducing FLOPs by >90% compared to AugReg-L while matching its performance when scaled to more tokens.
- For the first time, obtain 85% ImageNet accuracy with just 49 tokens in all transformer blocks.
- Demonstrate strong zero-shot CLIP performance from the bootstrapped SparseFormers despite not seeing any text during bootstrapping.
- Show the bootstrapped SparseFormers can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal models like LLaVa without any model fine-tuning.
