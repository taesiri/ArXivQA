# [Modeling and Numerical Analysis of Kangaroo Lower Body based on   Constrained Dynamics of Hybrid Serial-Parallel Floating-Base Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04161)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents modeling and analysis of the lower body of PAL Robotics' new bipedal humanoid robot called Kangaroo. Kangaroo features a unique hybrid serial-parallel kinematic design in its legs, with all electric linear actuators positioned near the pelvis to improve weight distribution. The authors employ constrained dynamics techniques to model these complex leg mechanisms. They provide an in-depth analysis of the non-linear joint limits, singularities, transmission effects, and manipulability of each closed linkage in Kangaroo's legs. Comparisons to PAL's previous biped TALOS demonstrate major improvements in terms of lower Cartesian inertia at the feet and better centroidal momentum properties. The paper validates the full leg model through simulation and initial experiments on the Kangaroo hardware, showing real-time computation of passive velocities, calibration procedures, and contact wrench estimates. Overall, Kangaroo's hybrid leg design and constrained modeling approach enable lightweight, robust, and dynamic locomotion capabilities suited for progression towards agile bipedal robots that can traverse complex environments.
