# [SCAFFLSA: Quantifying and Eliminating Heterogeneity Bias in Federated   Linear Stochastic Approximation and Temporal Difference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies federated linear stochastic approximation (LSA), where multiple agents with heterogeneous local datasets collaborate to solve a global linear system of equations. This arises in problems like federated temporal difference (TD) learning for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. Performing multiple local steps before communication leads to bias due to heterogeneity, limiting accuracy. Existing theory for algorithms like FedAvg does not properly characterize this.

Proposed Solution: 
1) The paper provides a finite sample analysis of the federated LSA (\FLSA) algorithm with local updates, explicitly quantifying the bias due to heterogeneity and delineating how it depends on key parameters like number of local steps.

2) To eliminate the bias, the paper proposes a novel method called Stochastic Controlled Averaging for Federated LSA (\BRFLSA) where control variates are introduced in the local updates to account for heterogeneity. Two communication strategies are studied: fixed probabilistic communication and deterministic temporal communication.

Main Contributions:

1) Precise non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence and sample complexity of \FLSA, with explicit characterization of heterogeneity bias.

2) Introduction of \BRFLSA for debiasing federated LSA using control variates, proven to converge without assumptions on heterogeneity. Communication complexity is analyzed under two paradigms.  

3) Application to federated TD learning - sample complexity bounds are provided for both \FLSA and \BRFLSA. While \FLSA allows linear speedup, \BRFLSA needs more communication but eliminates bias.

Overall, the paper provides fundamental insights into the analysis of federated LSA and TD learning, proposing methods to quantitatively understand and mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity.
