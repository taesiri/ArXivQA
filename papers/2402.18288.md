# [Development of Context-Sensitive Formulas to Obtain Constant Luminance   Perception for a Foreground Object in Front of Backgrounds of Varying   Luminance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18288)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of visual illusions in color perception, specifically the illusion of luminosity. It focuses on developing context-sensitive luminance correction formulas to produce constant luminance perception for foreground objects against backgrounds of varying luminance. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a simple theoretical framework based on the idea that luminance perception evolved to estimate the diffuse reflection term (material property) rather than the actual observed luminance. This allows for a qualitative estimate of an object's luminance to identify it, which is sufficient for survival needs. 

Based on this, they hypothesize a barycentric formula with a weighted average between the actual luminance and average illumination, where the weight acts like an opacity depending on the object's relative size. This opacity is modeled as a power function with a polynomial in the exponent.

Through an interactive web program, they determined the polynomial coefficients to achieve constant luminance perception across varying object sizes and backgrounds. The final opacity formula uses a quadratic polynomial in the exponent.

Main Contributions:

1) Framing of the problem from an evolutionary perspective for qualitative perception instead of accurate luminance reproduction.

2) Theoretical barycentric formula structure linking opacity to object size via a polynomial in the exponent.

3) Determining polynomial coefficients for constant luminance through interactive program.

4) Identifying that a simple quadratic polynomial is sufficient, which can be approximated by a linear function.

5) Publicly available interactive program to allow improving and testing different polynomial coefficients.

In summary, the key innovation is the theoretically-motivated formula structure with an interactive implementation to achieve the desired perceptual effect across conditions. The evolutionary arguments provide rationale for this approach over physical accuracy.
