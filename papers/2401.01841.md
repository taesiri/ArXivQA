# [Act as You Learn: Adaptive Decision-Making in Non-Stationary Markov   Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of sequential decision-making by an agent in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics of the environment (modeled as a Markov decision process or MDP) change over time. Specifically, the paper considers cases where the MDP changes discretely at certain time points. The core problems are: (1) how to safely explore the new environment to gather data and adapt, and (2) how to balance performance versus risk as the agent gains more understanding of the new environment.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (ADA-MCTS) algorithm. The key ideas are:

(1) Initially use a risk-averse MCTS strategy called RA-MCTS that considers worst-case outcomes during planning to safely explore the new environment. 

(2) Quantify the uncertainty in the learned model using Bayesian neural networks to estimate both aleatoric uncertainty (due to environment stochasticity) and epistemic uncertainty (due to lack of data).

(3) Use a dual-phase adaptive sampling strategy that transitions from risk-averse to regular sampling based on the aleatoric/epistemic uncertainties - i.e. be risk-seeking in state spaces the agent is confident about.

(4) Transfer knowledge from the previous MDP model while using latent parameters to capture new environment dynamics. This allows combining historical knowledge with new data.

Main Contributions:

(1) A principled ADA-MCTS algorithm that balances performance and risk in non-stationary MDPs by acting adaptively based on uncertainty.

(2) Empirical demonstration across multiple environments that ADA-MCTS outperforms prior approaches including when those have access to true environment dynamics unlike ADA-MCTS.

(3) Careful ablation study analyzing the impact of different components like risk-averse search and knowledge transfer.

(4) Addressing limitations of prior work that assume availability of updated environment models and continual environment evolution.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in adaptive online planning under discrete changes in MDP dynamics, while not having access to the true updated dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper proposes an Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to enable agents to safely explore and adapt decision-making to non-stationary environments by balancing risk-averse and reward-maximizing behavior based on quantified uncertainties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an adaptive Monte Carlo tree search (ADA-MCTS) algorithm for decision-making in non-stationary Markov decision processes (NSMDPs). Specifically:

1) The paper proposes using a risk-averse Monte Carlo tree search (RA-MCTS) strategy initially to safely explore the new environment when changes are detected. 

2) It introduces a dual-phase adaptive sampling strategy that leverages estimates of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to determine when to switch from the risk-averse strategy to a more reward-focused strategy as the agent adapts to the new environment.

3) The ADA-MCTS algorithm balances performance and risk by starting off pessimistic to ensure safety and gradually shifting to exploit updated knowledge of the environment dynamics once uncertainty decreases below thresholds.

4) Experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that ADA-MCTS outperforms prior approaches for decision-making in NSMDPs, even when those approaches have access to true environment dynamics that ADA-MCTS must learn itself.

In summary, the key contribution is an adaptive online planning algorithm that can safely explore and adapt decision-making to changed environments modeled as NSMDPs. The adaptive uncertainty-based sampling strategy allows the agent to balance risk and reward as it learns the new dynamics.

The paper focuses on sequential decision-making in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics of the environment (modeled as an MDP) change over time. Key goals are balancing safe exploration and reward maximization as the agent adapts online to the new environment. The proposed approach Adaptive MCTS (ADA-MCTS) leverages risk-averse MCTS, estimates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to guide an adaptive sampling strategy, and uses knowledge transfer to accelerate learning in the new environment. Evaluations are performed in non-stationary variants of standard RL benchmarks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using Bayesian neural networks for uncertainty quantification. How exactly are the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties quantified? What are the specific mathematical formulas used? 

2. The dual phase adaptive sampling strategy pivots between a risk-averse and regular sampling strategy. What specifically triggers the switch between these two strategies? How are the thresholds $\epsilon_E$ and $\epsilon_A$ set?

3. Explain in detail how the Adaptive MCTS algorithm balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically, walk through how the UCT formula is adapted to account for risk aversion. 

4. The paper argues that modeling uncertainty as monolithic is flawed. Explain what is meant by "monolithic" here and why the distinction between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty enables more nuanced decision making.

5. The latent parameter approach uses both global and local buffers. Explain the motivation behind this and how specifically the global knowledge and local knowledge are integrated. 

6. Compare and contrast in detail the differences between the ADA-MCTS approach and the Risk Averse Tree Search method proposed by Lecarpentier et al. What are the key algorithmic differences?

7. The empirical evaluation shows strong performance by ADA-MCTS. Analyze in depth the results on the Cliff Walking domain. Why does ADA-MCTS outperform even when baselines have access to ground truth models?

8. The ablation study highlights the utility of different components of ADA-MCTS. Explain the performance difference observed between RA-MCTS and standard MCTS. What does this reveal about the environments?

9. The approach assumes discrete changes in the MDP dynamics over time. Discuss the limitations of this assumption and how performance might change if applied to a continuously changing MDP. 

10. The paper states that rules for updating thresholds $\epsilon_E$ and $\epsilon_A$ can be devised. Propose strategies for automatically and adaptively setting these thresholds over time as the agent gathers more data.
