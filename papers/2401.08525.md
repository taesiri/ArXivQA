# [GATS: Gather-Attend-Scatter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Integrating multiple pretrained foundation models across different modalities (e.g. text, image, video) into a single multimodal model is challenging. Issues include model incompatibility, loss of knowledge during fine-tuning, inefficient training, and difficulty adapting architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose GATS (Gather-Attend-Scatter), a novel and general module for combining multiple foundation models while keeping them frozen. 
- GATS gathers activations from all models, attends to the most relevant cross-modal information, and scatters back updated representations that alter the original component models via their activations.
- This "steering" mechanism enables efficient coordination and knowledge transfer without fine-tuning or changing the foundation models.

Key Contributions:
- GATS provides a universal way to incorporate diverse modalities into a single model with negligible overhead. It is general, lightweight, and simplifies training.
- Steering leverages activations from frozen models instead of weights, preventing loss of pretraining knowledge.
- The method is versatile - GATS can act as cross-attention models or sequence transformers depending on hyperparameters.
- Compelling experiments showing state-of-the-art results in multiple environments (Atari, Language-Table, YCB) using agents with different foundation models.
- Image captioning model with GATS bridging text and vision, capable of both understanding and generating images conditioned on text.

In summary, GATS enables flexible integration of various pretrained models into multimodal systems, overcoming existing limitations. Its efficiency, generality across modalities and models, and strong performance highlight its usefulness as a universal connector for foundation models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Gather-Attend-Scatter (GATS), a novel and versatile module for seamlessly combining multiple pretrained foundation models across modalities like language, vision, and robotics without needing to fine-tune them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of GATS (Gather-Attend-Scatter), a novel and general-purpose module for seamlessly combining multiple pretrained foundation models across different modalities such as language, vision, and action. Key aspects of GATS include:

- It enables integrating diverse pretrained models without needing to modify or finetune them, avoiding the risk of losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. 

- It has a "steering" mechanism that allows efficient coordination and knowledge transfer between modalities by altering the forward pass of the pretrained models.

- It is lightweight and adds minimal computational overhead during inference while still allowing models to be conditioned on other modalities. 

- It is highly flexible and can be configured in many ways via hyperparameters to produce anything from highly symmetrical to highly asymmetrical architectures.

- It simplifies the process of building multimodal models and adapting them to new tasks or modalities. Parameters can be shared across tasks leading to more efficient training.

The paper demonstrates GATS capabilities through agent experiments in games, robotics simulations and by building a bimodal text-image model that can process and generate captions and images, while keeping the foundation models frozen.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- GATS (Gather-Attend-Scatter) - The novel module proposed that enables combining multiple pretrained foundation models into a larger multimodal network. Allows processing and generation across modalities.

- Steering - A key innovation of GATS where it can alter the forward pass of pretrained models to grant indirect access to their weights, avoiding the need to finetune them.

- Modality - Refers to the different types of inputs/outputs handled by models such as language, vision, actions, etc. GATS aims to enable coordination across modalities.

- Foundation models - Large pretrained models like language models, image classifiers, etc. that capture a lot of general knowledge. GATS allows seamlessly integrating them.

- Robotics - One application area highlighted is using GATS to combine language, vision, proprioception for robot control.

- Agent - Intelligent agents evaluated using GATS in environments like Atari, Language-Table, and YCB.

- Classifier-free guidance - A technique to better align agent action selection with language conditioning.

- Image captioning - Another application shown is using GATS to fuse language and vision for tasks like image caption generation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the GATS method proposed in the paper:

1. The GATS module processes embeddings from multiple modalities. How does it handle embeddings of different sizes from the various pretrained models? What projections are used before the attention step?

2. Explain the "gather" step in a GATS layer and how it enables attending to recent embeddings from each modality using local context lengths. How does this help in efficient multimodal processing?

3. How exactly does GATS interleave with and "steer" the pretrained unimodal transformers? What are the advantages of steering models versus simply using their feature representations?

4. Discuss the properties of GATS like generality, lightweight overhead, and efficient training that make it well-suited as a "universal connector" for foundation models. Provide examples to illustrate each property.  

5. The authors demonstrate GATS on multiple domains like games, robotics, and image-text models. Compare and contrast how GATS is adapted and used in two of these different settings. What modifications were required?

6. Explain how classifier-free guidance is incorporated in GATS agents and why it leads to improved goal-oriented behavior. How exactly is the guided policy computed? 

7. For the image-text generation experiments, the authors use a bimodal architecture with vision and language foundation models. Explain how these models are trained and highlight any unique strategies used.

8. What is the advantage of using vision transformers pretrained with GATS for the image-text experiments? How does it enable extending the bimodal model more easily later?

9. Compare the image versus video-based agents tested on the Language-Table environment. Why can't the results be directly compared? What conclusions can still be drawn about GATS?

10. The authors claim GATS simplifies adapting agents to handle multiple camera inputs, as required in the YCB environment. Elaborate on the specific advantages over traditional approaches in this robotic manipulation setting.
