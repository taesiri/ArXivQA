# [CoMFormer: Continual Learning in Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13999)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we design a continual learning model capable of operating on both semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by reformulating segmentation as a mask classification problem using a transformer architecture, it is possible to create a unified approach that can handle both semantic and panoptic segmentation in a continual learning setting. 

The main contributions seem to be:

1) Introducing the new task of continual panoptic segmentation, which combines the challenges of panoptic segmentation with continual learning.

2) Proposing CoMFormer, a transformer-based model that approaches segmentation as mask classification. This allows it to handle both semantic and panoptic segmentation under the same framework.

3) Designing methods to avoid catastrophic forgetting in CoMFormer, including an adaptive distillation loss and mask-based pseudo-labeling. 

4) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of CoMFormer on continual semantic segmentation benchmarks and the new continual panoptic segmentation benchmark.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that reformulating segmentation as mask classification enables a unified continual learning approach, which is validated through the CoMFormer model and experiments on semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks.
