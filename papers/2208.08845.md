# CASE: Aligning Coarse-to-Fine Cognition and Affection for Empathetic   Response Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to model the interaction between cognition and affection in empathy for empathetic response generation in dialogues?The key points are:- This paper proposes that generating empathetic responses in dialogues requires aligning and integrating both cognitive and affective aspects of empathy. - Existing models either focus only on the affective aspect (emotion detection) or treat cognition and affection separately. - The authors propose a new model called CASE that aligns cognition and affection at both coarse-grained (contextual) and fine-grained (specific inferenced) levels using mutual information maximization.- CASE utilizes commonsense knowledge to model cognition and concept knowledge to model affection, and aligns them in a two-level strategy.- Experiments show CASE generates more empathetic, coherent and informative responses compared to previous state-of-the-art models.In summary, the central hypothesis is that aligning and integrating cognitive and affective empathy is crucial for generating empathetic responses in dialogues, which CASE achieves through a two-level cognition-affection alignment strategy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a unified framework called CASE to model the interaction between cognition and affection for empathetic response generation. 2. It constructs two heterogeneous knowledge graphs - a commonsense cognition graph and an emotional concept graph - to aid in modeling cognition and affection.3. It proposes a two-level strategy to align coarse-grained and fine-grained cognition and affection using mutual information maximization. 4. It demonstrates through experiments that CASE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic and manual evaluation, generating more empathetic and informative responses.In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the CASE framework to align cognition and affection at multiple levels for empathetic response generation. The construction of knowledge graphs and the use of mutual information maximization are technical contributions that enable the realization of this key idea. The superiority of CASE is validated empirically.
