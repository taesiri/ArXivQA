# [MaTe3D: Mask-guided Text-based 3D-aware Portrait Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06947)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for 3D-aware face editing perform either mask-guided editing (e.g. changing local facial features) or text-based editing (generating images based on textual descriptions). However, there are no methods that can perform both types of editing simultaneously within a single framework.  

- Simply combining existing mask-guided and text-guided models results in a conflict where the generated image priorities one type of editing over the other rather than finding an optimal balance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose MaTe3D, a model for mask-guided and text-based 3D-aware portrait editing within a single framework.

- MaTe3D consists of two main components:
  1) A new SDF-based 3D generator that models global and local facial geometry representations to support the localized editing. It uses novel losses to ensure geometry and density consistency between global and local components.

  2) An inference-optimized editing method with two key techniques:
     - Blending score distillation sampling (SDS) loss to align texture and geometry
     - Conditional SDS loss utilizing generated 3D masks to improve stability

Main Contributions:

- First framework enabling simultaneous mask-guided and text-based editing for 3D-aware portrait synthesis

- A new SDF-based 3D portrait generator with global and local representations + consistency losses

- Two novel editing losses (blending SDS and conditional SDS) to overcome texture/geometry mismatch and appearance instability

- Introduction of CatMask-HQ, a large-scale high-quality dataset of cat face annotations to facilitate experiments

- Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in generating high quality and locally controllable 3D-aware portrait edits
