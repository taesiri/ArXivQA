# [MaTe3D: Mask-guided Text-based 3D-aware Portrait Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06947)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MaTe3D, a novel framework for mask-guided and text-based 3D-aware portrait editing within a single model. A key contribution is a new SDF-based 3D generator that models both global and local facial geometries to enable accurate mask-guided editing. This is achieved through novel SDF and density consistency losses. To perform editing, the method introduces techniques based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) - a blended SDS loss aligns geometry and texture, while a conditional SDS loss incorporates textual guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on datasets like FFHQ and the introduced high-quality CatMask-HQ. The method produces edited results that appropriately reflect mask-based edits and text guidance simultaneously. Limitations relate to potential image quality reduction from modeling geometry with SDFs, and challenges tuning real image results. Overall, MaTe3D advances mask-guided and text-based 3D-aware portrait editing within a single framework through innovations in geometric modeling, generator optimization, and inference-time guidance techniques.
