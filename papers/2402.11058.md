# [II-MMR: Identifying and Improving Multi-modal Multi-hop Reasoning in   Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11058)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most prior VQA research focuses only on overall accuracy, not reasoning capabilities. Current benchmarks also lack detailed reasoning breakdown, like number of reasoning hops.  
- Traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting struggles for VQA tasks, often generating incorrect or irrelevant rationales.

Proposed Solution - II-MMR:  
- Identifies and improves multi-modal multi-hop reasoning for VQA using two novel prompt strategies:
   - Answer prediction-guided CoT prompt (ApCoT): Incorporates model's predicted answer into CoT prompt to get more answer-focused reasoning.
   - Knowledge triplet-guided prompt (KtPrompt): Extracts knowledge triplets from QA to form reasoning path.
- Analyzes reasoning path to identify different reasoning cases - number of hops and types (visual or beyond-visual).

Key Contributions:
- Proposes II-MMR to identify and enhance multi-hop reasoning for VQA.
- Finds current benchmarks lack multi-hop questions and have inflated scores due to high performance on 1-hop questions.
- Shows II-MMR consistently improves over baselines across reasoning cases, especially on complex multi-hop questions.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel method II-MMR that can effectively analyze and improve multi-modal multi-hop reasoning for VQA tasks by generating high-quality reasoning paths guided by answer prediction or knowledge triplets.
