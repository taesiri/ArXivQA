# [Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Average Reward MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13469)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper resolves the open problem of determining the minimax optimal sample complexity for learning an near-optimal policy in average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) under a generative model. The authors attain a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(SAH/\varepsilon^2)$ for finding an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and where $H$ denotes the span seminorm of the optimal bias function. This matches the lower bound up to logarithmic factors without requiring the strong assumption of uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies, as in prior work. Their analysis carefully bounds relevant variance quantities using $H$ rather than the mixing times. A key component is an improved analysis for certain discounted MDPs satisfying $\gamma \geq 1 - 1/H$, where they establish a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(SAH/(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2)$ for finding an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. By reduction from the discounted to the average reward setting, this yields the desired average reward sample complexity. Through refined analysis, the paper provides new insight into the relationship between average and discounted MDPs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper resolves the open problem of establishing the minimax optimal sample complexity for learning an near-optimal policy in average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) under a generative model. The authors prove a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(SAH/\varepsilon^2)$ for finding an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, where $H$ is the span of the optimal bias function. This matches the lower bound and does not require assumptions on mixing times. The analysis is based on a novel reduction to discounted MDPs, where the authors also establish an improved analysis yielding superior sample complexity bounds when the discount factor $\gamma$ is close to 1. Overall, this work makes substantial progress on understanding average reward MDPs, makesConnections between average and discounted criteria more clear, and the technical developments regarding discounted MDP variance estimates may prove useful more broadly.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper resolves the open problem of establishing the minimax optimal sample complexity of learning an near-optimal policy for average reward Markov decision processes under a generative model, in terms of the span sem-norm of the optimal bias function, without requiring the strong assumption of uniformly bounded mixing times.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, this paper aims to resolve the open question of determining the minimax optimal sample complexity for learning an near-optimal policy in average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) under a generative model. Specifically, the paper establishes a sample complexity bound of Õ(SAH/ε^2) for learning an ε-optimal policy, where S is the number of states, A is the number of actions, H is the span of the optimal bias function, and ε is the desired accuracy. This matches the known minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. The bound holds for weakly communicating MDPs and does not require assumptions on mixing times.

To achieve this, the paper develops an improved analysis of a reduction-based approach that converts the average reward MDP to a discounted MDP. A key component is a refined bound on variance quantities that replaces a dependence on 1/(1-γ) with the span H in relevant regimes. Overall, the central hypothesis is that the sample complexity for average reward MDPs can be resolved optimally using a reduction to discounted MDPs combined with a tighter understanding of variance in terms of the span parameter H. The paper confirms this hypothesis by providing the first minimax optimal sample complexity result.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) It resolves the sample complexity of learning an ε-optimal policy in an average reward MDP under a generative model, establishing a complexity bound of Õ(SAH/ε^2). This matches the minimax lower bound and does not require assumptions on uniform mixing times.

2) It provides an improved analysis of using the reduction to discounted MDP approach for solving average reward MDPs. In particular, it shows that by using the span seminorm H = ||h^*||_span to characterize the variance, the sample complexity of the discounted MDP can be improved to Õ(SAH/(1-γ)^2ε^2) under certain assumptions. 

3) The improved discounted MDP analysis allows the reduction to discounted MDPs to attain the optimal Õ(SAH/ε^2) sample complexity for average reward MDPs. This further clarifies the relationship between average and discounted MDPs.

4) More broadly, the variance analyses done in this paper in terms of the span seminorm H provide tighter characterizations than using mixing times or diameter, and may find wider applications in analyzing MDPs.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and technical contributions towards understanding the sample complexity of average reward MDPs and relating them to discounted MDPs. The span seminorm based analyses are an important technique highlighted by this work.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the research on sample complexity bounds for average-reward MDPs:

1. It establishes a minimax optimal sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{H}{\varepsilon^2} \right)$ in terms of the span $H$ of the optimal bias function. This matches known lower bounds and improves upon prior work that had suboptimal dependence on key parameters. 

2. The result does not require the strong assumption of uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies, which is commonly needed in prior work. It only assumes the MDP is weakly communicating.

3. A key technical contribution is refined analysis of the variance-dependent error bounds for the algorithm from Li et al. (2020). By more carefully bounding certain variance quantities using the span parameter $H$, the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)^3$ is improved to $1/(1-\gamma)^2$ in relevant regimes.

4. The refined analysis for discounted MDPs is of independent interest and circumvents known lower bounds when $\gamma \gtrsim 1 - 1/H$. This analysis helps clarify the relationship between average-reward and discounted MDPs.

5. The optimal dependence on mixing-related parameters is obtained using the span $H$ rather than the broader uniform mixing times $\tmix$. Since $H$ can be much smaller, this leads to sharper bounds.

Overall, this paper makes important progress on a well-studied open problem by developing novel technical insights. The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in understanding the sample complexity of average-reward MDPs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors do not explicitly suggest specific future research directions in the conclusion. However, based on the overall content and contributions of the paper, some potential future directions include:

1) Applying the techniques developed in this paper, such as the refined analysis of the variance parameters using the span norm, to other reinforcement learning problems involving average or discounted reward MDPs.

2) Investigating whether the ideas in this paper can help provide improved sample complexity bounds for other criteria such as finite horizon problems. 

3) Studying whether the relationship between average reward and discounted MDPs illuminated in this work can lead to new algorithms or analyses for other reinforcement learning settings like model-free tabular RL.

4) Extending the results to incorporate function approximation or richer state/action spaces beyond the tabular setting studied here.

In summary, while no explicit future work is suggested, the paper develops new techniques and insights that open up possibilities for extensions and improvements in multiple directions in future research on reinforcement learning theory.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs)
- Sample complexity
- Generative model
- $\varepsilon$-optimal policy
- Weakly communicating MDPs
- Bias function
- Span norm
- Reduction to discounted MDP
- Variance analysis

To summarize, this paper studies the sample complexity (number of samples needed) to learn a near-optimal policy in an average-reward MDP, under the assumption of access to a generative model that can sample next states. A key parameter is the span norm of the bias function of the optimal policy. The main approach is reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP, along with an improved analysis of variance quantities that leads to better dependence on this span parameter. The setting considers weakly communicating MDPs and does not assume uniformly bounded mixing times. The main result matches information-theoretic lower bounds in its dependence on key parameters.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper reduces the average-reward MDP problem to a discounted MDP problem. What is the intuition behind why this reduction allows one to obtain improved sample complexity bounds compared to directly analyzing the average-reward setting?

2. The analysis relies crucially on bounding certain variance quantities involving the optimal discounted policy $\pi^*_\gamma$. How does the paper exploit properties of $\pi^*_\gamma$ in order to obtain tighter variance bounds than typical analysis? 

3. The paper assumes the span norm of the optimal average-reward bias function $H = \|h^*\|_{\text{span}}$ is known. How might one extend the approach if only a crude upper bound on $H$ were available?

4. Could the techniques be extended to obtain high-probability bounds rather than the provided probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds? What new challenges would arise?

5. The optimal policy $\pi^*$ for the average-reward MDP induces a Markov chain that may not necessarily be aperiodic. How does the proof handle this potential periodicity in relating $H$ and the discounted analysis?

6. Could ideas from the analysis be used to improve sample complexity results for specialized MDPs, such as tabular episodic MDPs? 

7. The paper assumes reward functions are known and deterministic. How might the presence of stochastic rewards affect the reduction approach and analysis?

8. What possibilities are there for improving the dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the sample complexity from $1/\varepsilon^2$ to $1/\varepsilon$?

9. How tight are the established lower bounds for this problem? Could the analysis lead to improved lower bounds? 

10. The result requires a form of weak communication in the MDP. What specific challenges arise in extending the method and analysis to completely uncontrolled MDPs?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the sample complexity (number of samples needed) for learning a near-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. Prior work either assumes all policies mix quickly or achieves suboptimal dependence on key parameters. The goal is to resolve the sample complexity in terms of the span $H$ of the optimal bias function, without restrictive assumptions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel analysis of a reduction-based approach that converts the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP. A key insight is that the sample complexity for certain discounted MDPs can be improved to $\widetilde{O}(SAH/(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2)$ when $1/(1-\gamma) \geq H$, circumventing known lower bounds. By applying this discounted MDP algorithm to a discounted MDP derived from the average-reward MDP, an optimal average-reward sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(SAH/\varepsilon^2)$ is obtained.

Technical Contributions:
- Establishes the first minimax optimal sample complexity for average-reward MDPs in terms of the span $H$, without assumptions on mixing times.
- Develops improved analysis for discounted MDPs when $1/(1-\gamma)$ is large compared to $H$, using a delicate multi-step variance decomposition.  
- Carefully relates variance quantities across optimal and learned policies using policy suboptimality, enabling instance-dependent bounds.
- Matches information-theoretic lower bounds in all parameters for both average-reward and discounted MDPs.

The results significantly expand our understanding of the relationship between average-reward and discounted MDPs. The analysis techniques may find broader use in analyzing reinforcement learning algorithms.
