# [On the Computational Complexity of Stackelberg Planning and   Meta-Operator Verification: Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stackelberg planning is an adversarial planning framework where two players (leader and follower) act sequentially in a classical planning task. The leader tries to maximize the cost for the follower to achieve its goal.
- Prior work has focused on algorithms but there has been no theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of Stackelberg planning. This is an open research gap.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a computational complexity analysis of Stackelberg planning, comparing to classical planning. Consider decision problems like plan existence and optimal planning.
- Analyze complexity under different syntactic restrictions on the planning task, to identify potential tractable fragments.
- Also analyze the complexity of the related problem of meta-operator verification.

Main Contributions:
- Show Stackelberg plan existence is PSPACE-complete, same as classical planning, but optimal planning under bounded plan lengths is Σ2^P-complete compared to NP-complete for classical planning. This suggests compilations to classical planning likely need exponential blowup in plan length.
- Identify that Stackelberg planning remains intractable even for syntactic fragments where classical planning becomes tractable. 
- Prove meta-operator verification is PSPACE-complete in general but Π2^P-complete under bounded plan lengths, contrasting the complexity of Stackelberg planning.

In summary, this is the first computational complexity analysis of Stackelberg planning and meta-operator verification. It establishes firm theoretical foundations on the complexity of these problems, identifying cases where compiling to classical planning is likely inefficient, and highlighting the additional challenges compared to classical planning even in restricted syntactic fragments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the computational complexity of Stackelberg planning and meta-operator verification, showing they are PSPACE-complete in general but become complete for higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy under polynomial plan length restrictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing the first theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of Stackelberg planning and related problems. Specifically:

- The paper shows that Stackelberg planning is PSPACE-complete in general, the same as classical planning. However, under a polynomial plan length restriction, Stackelberg planning becomes Σ^P_2-complete. This implies that unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, there cannot be a polynomial-time compilation of Stackelberg planning into classical planning without an exponential blowup in plan length.

- The paper analyzes the complexity of Stackelberg planning under various syntactic task restrictions, showing that it remains intractable even in cases where classical planning becomes tractable. 

- The paper also studies the complexity of meta-operator verification, showing it is PSPACE-complete in general and Π^P_2-complete under polynomial plan length bounds, with similar implications regarding compileability into classical planning.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive complexity-theoretic characterization of Stackelberg planning and related problems, identifying sources of intrinsic difficulty beyond classical planning. This lays a foundation for developing planning algorithms and heuristics tailored to these models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that Stackelberg planning is PSPACE-complete like classical planning in general. What is an intuition behind the proof showing Stackelberg planning's PSPACE-hardness?

2. Under a polynomial plan length restriction, Stackelberg planning becomes Σ2^P-complete. What does this suggest about the possibility of polynomial-time reductions from Stackelberg planning to classical planning?

3. The paper analyzes the complexity of Stackelberg planning under various syntactic restrictions studied in classical planning literature. Why is this analysis relevant even though the general Stackelberg planning problem is PSPACE-complete?  

4. For the case of 1 precondition and 1+ effect per action, the paper shows Stackelberg plan existence is Σ2^P-complete while classical plan existence is NP-complete. Intuitively, why is there this gap?

5. Explore the reduction showing Σ2^P-hardness of Stackelberg planning with * preconditions and 1 effect per action. What is the high level idea behind encoding QBF formulas into such planning tasks?

6. The paper proves Stackelberg optimal planning with no preconditions and 2 effects per action is Σ2^P-complete. Walk through the key ideas in the reduction construction and how it relates valuations of variables in a QBF formula to plans.  

7. What is the complexity of optimal Stackelberg planning with no preconditions and 1 effect under unit action costs? Explain why this special case becomes tractable.

8. Compare the complexity results for meta-operator verification to those for Stackelberg planning. What explains the complementarity (e.g. Π2^P vs Σ2^P) in the bounded case?

9. The paper mentions monotonicity differences between meta-operator validation and Stackelberg planning. What is the practical implication in terms of analyzing syntactic restrictions?

10. What open questions remain in understanding the theoretical complexity landscape of Stackelberg planning and related problems like meta-operator validation?
