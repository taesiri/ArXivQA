# [On the Computational Complexity of Stackelberg Planning and   Meta-Operator Verification: Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stackelberg planning is an adversarial planning framework where two players (leader and follower) act sequentially in a classical planning task. The leader tries to maximize the cost for the follower to achieve its goal.
- Prior work has focused on algorithms but there has been no theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of Stackelberg planning. This is an open research gap.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a computational complexity analysis of Stackelberg planning, comparing to classical planning. Consider decision problems like plan existence and optimal planning.
- Analyze complexity under different syntactic restrictions on the planning task, to identify potential tractable fragments.
- Also analyze the complexity of the related problem of meta-operator verification.

Main Contributions:
- Show Stackelberg plan existence is PSPACE-complete, same as classical planning, but optimal planning under bounded plan lengths is Σ2^P-complete compared to NP-complete for classical planning. This suggests compilations to classical planning likely need exponential blowup in plan length.
- Identify that Stackelberg planning remains intractable even for syntactic fragments where classical planning becomes tractable. 
- Prove meta-operator verification is PSPACE-complete in general but Π2^P-complete under bounded plan lengths, contrasting the complexity of Stackelberg planning.

In summary, this is the first computational complexity analysis of Stackelberg planning and meta-operator verification. It establishes firm theoretical foundations on the complexity of these problems, identifying cases where compiling to classical planning is likely inefficient, and highlighting the additional challenges compared to classical planning even in restricted syntactic fragments.
