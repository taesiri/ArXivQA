# [VQCNIR: Clearer Night Image Restoration with Vector-Quantized Codebook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08606)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VQCNIR, a new method for night image restoration that leverages a vector-quantized (VQ) codebook as a high-quality prior. The key insight is that relying solely on degraded low-quality night images for restoration can accumulate errors, while an external high-quality codebook provides reliable priors. However, directly applying the codebook causes inconsistent illumination and inaccurate texture matching. To address this, VQCNIR incorporates two novel modules - an Adaptive Illumination Enhancement Module (AIEM) that uses estimated illumination curves to align codebook and input features, and a Deformable Bi-Directional Cross-Attention (DBCA) module to fuse textures using bi-directional cross-attention. Through progressively fusing codebook priors with input features, VQCNIR is able to effectively restore high-quality night images with proper illumination and sharp realistic details. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The ablation studies also validate the efficacy of the proposed AIEM and DBCA modules. Overall, by introducing high-quality codebook priors and adaptively fusing them with degraded input features, VQCNIR advances the state-of-the-art in night image restoration.
