## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video frame interpolation is becoming increasingly popular, but evaluation is challenging due to many datasets and inconsistent metrics across papers.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a new benchmark for video frame interpolation with a submission website for consistent metrics.
- Carefully designed synthetic dataset of 666 sequences adhering to linear motion assumption.
- Analyze interpolation quality w.r.t. various attributes like motion magnitude thanks to synthetic ground truth. 
- Evaluate computational efficiency coherently on standardized hardware.

Key Contributions:
- Establish consistent metrics and facilitate comparisons via submission website.
- Provide new insights by analyzing impact of motion properties on quality.
- Adhere to valid assumption of linear motion with synthetic data.
- Enable future focus on difficult areas like occlusions.
- Coherently measure computational performance.

Overall, the paper introduces a principled video interpolation benchmark to address limitations of existing datasets and evaluation approaches. Through consistent metrics, a synthetic test set, and detailed attribute-based analysis, it aims to provide better evaluation and drive future progress.
