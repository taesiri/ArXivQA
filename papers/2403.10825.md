# [Affective Behaviour Analysis via Integrating Multi-Modal Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10825)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper aims to analyze human affective behavior and recognize emotions from facial expressions, voice, and body language. Specifically, it addresses five competitive tracks set up by the 6th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition: Action Unit (AU) Detection, Compound Expression (CE) Recognition, Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) Estimation, Expression (EXPR) Recognition, and Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation. The goal is to evaluate the authenticity and applicability of emotion analysis techniques on real-world datasets captured in uncontrolled environments like Aff-Wild2, C-EXPR-DB, and Hume-Vidmimic2.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed method has three main components:

1) Image Encoder: Uses a Masked Auto Encoder (MAE) pre-trained on a large-scale facial image dataset and fine-tuned for each task to extract powerful visual features.

2) Transformer-based Fusion: Employs transformers to fuse information across modalities (visual, audio, text) to attain comprehensive emotion representations. 

3) Ensemble Learning: Divides dataset into subsets based on background characteristics, trains separate classifiers for each subset, and ensembles predictions to improve generalization.

Main Contributions:

1) Integrates a large facial image dataset to pre-train the MAE for effective visual feature extraction.

2) Leverages transformer-based models to fuse multi-modal emotional information from images, audio, and text.

3) Adopts an ensemble approach to train classifiers on dataset splits, enhancing applicability across diverse real-world environments.

The method is evaluated on ABAW tasks and datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Key strengths include fully exploring multi-modal emotional cues and high generalization ability to complex uncontrolled environments.
