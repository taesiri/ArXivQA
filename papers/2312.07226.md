 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper documents Elsevier's CAS LaTeX template, which provides classfiles cas-sc.cls and cas-dc.cls for typesetting single-column and double-column journal articles respectively according to the updated Elsevier workflow. The template supports features like long front matter, various options for authors such as ORCID, Twitter handle, etc., special theorem-like environments, detailed bibliography formatting, and CRediT authorship statements. Usage, front matter elements like title, authors, abstract, and keywords are covered in detail. Main matter including text, sections, figures and tables, the theorem layout, bibliography using model1-num-names.bst or cas-model2-names.bst, and CRediT statements with \printcredits are also discussed with examples. Overall, this paper thoroughly documents the CAS LaTeX template which helps prepare properly formatted manuscripts for Elsevier CAS journals.
