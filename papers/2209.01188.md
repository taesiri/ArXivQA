# [Petals: Collaborative Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01188)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Petals, a system that enables collaborative inference and fine-tuning of large language models over the internet. It allows multiple participants to run servers hosting subsets of a large model's layers. Clients can then form chains of these servers to perform distributed inference or fine-tuning. Petals uses optimizations like model quantization and low-latency routing to achieve efficient performance, running inference of the 176B parameter BLOOM model at around 1 step per second on consumer GPUs. Aside from inference, Petals also supports parameter-efficient training methods like adapters and prompt tuning, with interfaces to easily share trained modules on a model hub. Overall, Petals aims to broaden access to large models by pooling compute resources across parties, providing capabilities for both inference and adaptation to new tasks in a decentralized manner.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Petals, a system that enables collaborative inference and fine-tuning of large language models over the internet. Petals allows users to run parts of a large model on their own devices while relying on other users' devices for the remaining parts. For inference, clients store embeddings locally while servers run transformer blocks, with clients routing inputs through chains of servers. For fine-tuning, clients own trained parameters while servers host pretrained layers, allowing collaborative adaptation. The system uses optimizations like quantization and latency-aware routing to efficiently run models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Petals aims to provide affordable access to recent large models and enable collaborative improvement of their capabilities over time.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces Petals, a system that allows multiple users to collaboratively perform inference and fine-tuning of large language models over the internet by distributing model layers across different devices.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to enable efficient collaborative inference and fine-tuning of very large language models (with hundreds of billions of parameters) by distributing the computation across multiple devices connected over the internet. 

The key ideas explored in the paper are:

- Allowing multiple users to run servers hosting subsets of the model layers, while other users act as clients that query these servers to perform inference or fine-tuning. 

- Using optimizations like model quantization and latency-aware routing to maximize throughput when spreading computation across many devices.

- Supporting flexible access to intermediate model states and outputs during inference and training, unlike typical inference APIs.

- Enabling easy sharing and reuse of fine-tuned model components through a model hub.

So in summary, the main research question is how to democratize access to the latest ultra-large language models by distributing their computation in a collaborative manner, overcoming hardware limitations and allowing flexible usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Petals, a system for efficient collaborative inference and fine-tuning of large language models. The key ideas include:

- Allowing multiple users to collaborate by contributing GPUs/servers to run different parts of large models like BLOOM-176B. This makes it possible to run these models on consumer hardware.

- Supporting efficient inference by compressing model weights and communication buffers. The system also handles dynamic server selection and failure recovery.

- Enabling flexible fine-tuning through parameter-efficient methods like adapters or prompt tuning. Users can train custom model extensions and share them on a hub.

- Providing a convenient API and applications like a chatbot to simplify using large models through the collaborative swarm.

In summary, Petals aims to democratize access to large language models by distributing computation and allowing collaborative training. This is the main contribution described in the paper.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to other research on efficient inference of large language models:

- It proposes a collaborative system called Petals that allows multiple parties to jointly perform inference and fine-tuning of models with over 100 billion parameters. This is a novel approach compared to existing work on model parallelism or offloading, which rely on hardware within a single organization. 

- Petals introduces optimizations like dynamic quantization and latency-aware routing to make distributed execution over consumer hardware efficient. For example, it can run inference of the 176B parameter BLOOM model at over 1 step per second, which is an order of magnitude faster than offloading techniques.

- The paper demonstrates Petals on real-world networks with up to 14 globally distributed servers. It provides thorough benchmarks showing the performance impact of factors like network bandwidth and latency. 

- Petals supports distributed fine-tuning using methods like adapter tuning or prompt tuning. Users can insert custom modules into the model and share trained adapters on a hub. This provides more flexibility compared to inference APIs.

- The paper discusses the ecosystem enabled by Petals, such as collaborative model improvement, tracking model versions, and living benchmarks. This goes beyond just proposing a system and envisions how it could transform research practices.

Overall, this work makes distributed execution of huge models practical and proposes a collaborative framework that could open new possibilities for model usage, improvement, and sharing. The real-world evaluations and discussion of the ecosystem make significant contributions compared to prior work on efficient LLM inference.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Implementing an incentives system to encourage users to run servers and contribute computing resources to the network. This could involve earning points for serving model layers that can be exchanged for rewards.

- Improving privacy by using secure multi-party computation or privacy-preserving hardware to prevent servers from recovering input tokens. 

- Adding security mechanisms like requiring servers to pledge points that can be claimed if they return incorrect outputs. This would disincentivize cheating.

- Developing a system to track versions of fine-tuned model parameters as they change over time, similar to version control for code. 

- Creating a way to rapidly benchmark model versions on living benchmarks to ensure newer versions improve capabilities.

- Adding support for fine-grained model versioning in Petals, so users can specify model versions and servers can indicate compatibility. This would facilitate principled updates to the base model over time.

- Annotating fine-tuned adapters with the model version they apply to.

In summary, they suggest enhancements around incentives, privacy, security, tracking model changes, benchmarking, and compatibility for model versions.
