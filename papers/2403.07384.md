# [SmallToLarge (S2L): Scalable Data Selection for Fine-tuning Large   Language Models by Summarizing Training Trajectories of Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07384)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data is important for maximizing their performance in specialized tasks. However, collecting high-quality domain data is challenging and expensive. 
- Existing data selection methods rely on metrics like perplexity, confidence scores or model embeddings to select data. But these methods fail for SFT due to:
  1) Distribution shift between pretraining and fine-tuning data renders these metrics less informative
  2) Computational cost of generating these metrics becomes prohibitive for very large models

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes {\fullname} ({\alg}), a more effective and scalable data selection method for SFT of LLMs.
- Key ideas:
  - Use a much smaller reference model to record "training trajectories" - the losses of each training example over iterations
  - Cluster training examples based on similarity of trajectories 
  - Select balanced subsets from each cluster
- Benefits:
  - Captures useful signals correlated with model's learning capability
  - Avoids bias from solely picking easiest or complex examples
  - Can use model much smaller than target model -> more scalable

Contributions:
- Proposes a new scalable and effective data selection method {\alg} for SFT of LLMs
- Shows {\alg} matches full dataset performance on mathematical reasoning using only 11\% MathInstruct data, outperforming SOTA selection methods
- Demonstrates {\alg}'s superior performance across models scales (410M parameters to 2.8B) and architectures (Pythia, Phi)
- Validates effectiveness on clinical text summarization using MIMIC-III data
- Provides extensive ablation studies on impact of trajectory length, timing etc.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in tackling the key challenge of data efficiency for SFT of LLMs through the proposed {\alg} technique. The comprehensive experiments highlight {\alg}'s state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models and scales.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SmallToLarge (S2L), a scalable data selection method for efficiently fine-tuning large language models on specialized domains by clustering training trajectories from small models and sampling balanced subsets that improve data efficiency and match full dataset performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new data selection method called "SmallToLarge" (S2L) that can significantly improve the data efficiency of supervised fine-tuning for large language models in specialized domains. 

Specifically, S2L leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. It first gathers the loss trajectories for each training example using a smaller reference model. These trajectories are then clustered, and a balanced selection is made from these clusters to ensure coverage of all learning patterns. 

The key benefits highlighted in the paper are:

1) S2L can match the performance of training on the full dataset using only a small fraction of the data (e.g. 11% for math problem solving).

2) It outperforms existing state-of-the-art data selection methods by a significant margin.

3) The data selected by S2L transfers well to larger model sizes and even different model architectures. 

4) S2L can perform effective data selection using a reference model much smaller than the target model, making it very scalable.

Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and clinical text summarization tasks, the paper demonstrates S2L's effectiveness in improving data efficiency for supervised fine-tuning of large language models.

The paper introduces a data selection method called "SmallToLarge" (S2L) that selects data for fine-tuning large language models in specialized domains by clustering training trajectories from smaller models. The key ideas involve using training dynamics on smaller models to guide selection, clustering examples based on trajectory similarities, and balanced sampling from clusters. The method is evaluated on mathematical problem-solving with the MathInstruct dataset and clinical text summarization with the MIMIC-III dataset.

Overall, the paper demonstrates superior data efficiency and scalability compared to prior data selection techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method utilize training trajectories of examples on smaller models to guide data selection for larger models? What is the intuition behind why this would work?

2. Clustering training trajectories enables selecting a diverse set of examples - but what specific clustering algorithm is used in the paper and why was it chosen over other options? 

3. The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness on mathematical and clinical text summarization tasks. What modifications would be needed to apply it to other specialized domains like legal or scientific documents?

4. What are some ways the length and density of training trajectories could impact the quality of data selected? What tradeoffs exist in recording longer but potentially more sparse trajectories?  

5. When recording training trajectories on the reference model, what guidelines should be followed in terms of model size, when to start recording, frequency of checkpoints etc. to balance cost and data quality?

6. How does the proposed balanced sampling strategy for final selection based on cluster sizes ensure coverage of all knowledge and skills required for specialized fine-tuning?

7. What modifications could make the clustering of training trajectories more robust to noise or variability - would techniques like ensemble clustering help?

8. For practical deployment, how can collecting trajectories and final selection be made efficient enough to handle massive datasets required for large language model fine-tuning?

9. The method relies on training dynamic consistency between smaller and larger models - but could there be cases where this assumption breaks down? How can it be tested?

10. What other innovative ways could the rich information in training trajectories be utilized beyond just guiding data selection - could it enable personalized optimization or debugging of model training?
