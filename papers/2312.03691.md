# [On the Role of Edge Dependency in Graph Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03691)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a structured hierarchy for categorizing graph generative models based on their level of edge dependency: edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent models. The authors prove tight theoretical bounds relating each model category's ability to generate short cycles like triangles to their overlap, which measures output graph diversity. These bounds show that models with higher edge dependency can produce graphs with more triangles for a fixed level of overlap. The paper also proposes simple baseline models for each level leveraging dense subgraph discovery, as well as empirically evaluates both these and other popular models. A key finding is that sophisticated deep models often simply memorize properties of a single input graph instead of generalizing, while the simple baselines effectively balance triangle counts and overlap. Overall, the paper facilitates advancement of graph generative models by offering both a structured evaluation framework emphasizing output diversity and robust baselines achieving competitive performance through interpretable means.
