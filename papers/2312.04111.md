# [Breaking the Entanglement of Homophily and Heterophily in   Semi-supervised Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04111)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new data engineering framework called AMUD and a novel directed graph neural network architecture called ADPA. AMUD provides modeling guidance for natural digraphs by quantifying the correlation between node profiles and topology to determine whether to retain the inherent directed edges or transform them into an undirected graph. This breaks the entanglement of homophily and heterophily in the graph to maximize benefits for subsequent learning. ADPA is then proposed as a new digraph learning paradigm that adaptively discovers suitable directed patterns (DPs) to capture multi-scale structural information. It performs feature propagation guided by these DPs and then leverages two hierarchical node-wise attention mechanisms to achieve node-adaptive fusion of the multi-granularity representations. Experiments on 14 benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMUD effectively guides the topological modeling and learning process, significantly boosting performance. Meanwhile, ADPA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins under both directed and undirected scenarios. The paper provides valuable insights into graph-based data engineering and establishes a new foundation for future digraph learning.
