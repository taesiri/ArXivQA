## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this AISHELL-2 paper to other Mandarin speech recognition research:

- Data scale: At 1000 hours, the AISHELL-2 corpus is significantly larger than many other publicly available Mandarin speech datasets like AISHELL-1 (170 hours), thchs30 (30 hours), aidatatang (200 hours), etc. The large data size allows for building more robust and accurate models.

- Real-world data: The data comes from real smartphone recordings (iOS), making it more representative of real usage compared to lab-recorded speech datasets. The multi-channel dev/test sets also capture channel variability.

- Industrial baseline: The paper provides a full Kaldi recipe for an industrial-scale Mandarin ASR system, including components like segmentation, vocabulary expansion, etc. This is unique compared to just releasing speech data.

- Accessibility: Being completely open-sourced under a permissive license makes AISHELL-2 widely accessible to researchers. Other major Mandarin corpora are proprietary or restricted. 

- Lexicon: The bilingual lexicon with a pinyin layer is more customizable than typical lexicons. Researchers can easily adapt to new vocabularies or phone sets.

- State-of-the-art methods: The baseline uses modern techniques like TDNNs, LF-MMI training, iVectors that achieve much better accuracy than old GMM-HMM systems.

Overall, the large scale, industrial relevance, open release, and strong baselines make AISHELL-2 a uniquely valuable contribution compared to prior Mandarin ASR research. It has enabled further advancement in this field.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problems/questions being addressed are:

- There is a lack of large, high-quality, freely available speech data sets for Mandarin speech recognition research. Previous data sets like thchs30 and hkust are limited in size and scope. The authors aim to address this by releasing the new AISHELL-2 corpus.

- It is difficult to transfer speech recognition research into industrial applications and products. The authors aim to provide resources to help bridge this gap, such as baseline recipes and test data from different acoustic channels. 

- Mandarin speech recognition has some unique challenges compared to English, like the need for Chinese word segmentation. The authors implement tools like the DaCiDian dictionary and Jieba segmentation to address this.

- Acoustic and language model mismatches between training and deployment data hurt performance. The authors demonstrate simple transfer learning techniques like model fine-tuning and language model interpolation to adapt models.
