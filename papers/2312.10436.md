# [Decomposing Hard SAT Instances with Metaheuristic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the fundamental problem of estimating the hardness of a Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with respect to a given complete SAT solver. Hard SAT instances often exhibit unpredictable heavy-tailed runtime distributions, making it difficult to estimate how long a solver will take to solve them. The paper proposes a novel hardness measure called decomposition hardness (d-hardness) to estimate the runtime.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is to decompose the CNF formula using a subset B of its variables. By enumerating all possible assignments to B, 2^{|B|} simpler CNF subformulas are generated. By running the SAT solver on each subformula, the total runtime can be calculated, allowing the estimation of the hardness. This runtime can be expressed as the expected value of a random variable ξ_B. The d-hardness estimation problem then reduces to a pseudo-Boolean optimization problem of finding a B that minimizes this expected value. 

To efficiently optimize the d-hardness, the paper proposes several key techniques:

- Using incremental SAT solving to identify and separately count easy subproblems
- Reducing the search space using lookahead-inspired heuristics 
- Drawing connections to ρ-backdoors to further optimize decomposition
- Constructing decomposed unsatisfiability proofs for faster proof checking

The d-hardness estimation is performed using a genetic algorithm, and is shown to find small backdoor sets that can solve hard SAT instances faster than directly running a SAT solver.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of the novel concept of decomposition hardness, allowing estimation of SAT hardness
- Formulation as a pseudo-Boolean optimization problem enabling decomposition-based solving
- Several techniques to significantly improve the efficiency of search for optimal decompositions
- Demonstration of faster solving and proof checking using constructed backdoor sets

The paper makes a significant contribution towards estimating and overcoming the fundamental hardness of SAT using decomposition techniques. The proposed hardness measure and optimization framework enable faster solving of hard industrial SAT instances.
