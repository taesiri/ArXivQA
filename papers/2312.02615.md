# [Projection Regret: Reducing Background Bias for Novelty Detection via   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02615)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Projection Regret (PR), a new method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using diffusion models. The key insight is that diffusion models can project any image to an in-distribution image with similar backgrounds through an intermediate diffusion and reverse process. However, metrics like pixel-wise distance often fail to capture semantic differences between images when background information dominates. To address this, PR computes the perceptual distance between a test image and its diffusion-based projection. Furthermore, PR utilizes a two-step projection to cancel out background bias by comparing the distance for the original test image against that of its first projection. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that PR significantly outperforms prior arts in diffusion and other generative model-based OOD detection. Notably, PR shows substantial gains on detecting OOD images sharing similar backgrounds to the in-distribution data. The effectiveness highlights the importance of handling background bias for OOD detection with generative models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Projection Regret, a novel out-of-distribution detection method for diffusion models that mitigates background bias by comparing the perceptual distance between an image and its diffusion-based projections.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing to use the perceptual distance between an image and its diffusion-based projection as an effective abnormality score for novelty detection. This helps mitigate the background bias issue in prior methods. 

2) Introducing Projection Regret (PR), which further reduces background bias by canceling it out using recursive projections. This involves projecting both the input image and its first projection to better capture semantic differences.

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of Projection Regret across various novelty detection benchmarks, where it outperforms prior arts including other diffusion and generative model based methods.

4) Proposing an alternative perceptual distance metric computed from the U-Net decoder features of the pre-trained diffusion model. This shows comparable performance to using LPIPS distance.

In summary, the key contribution is developing Projection Regret to leverage diffusion projections for more effective novelty detection, while specifically tackling the background bias issue that hinders prior arts. Both the projection concept and the recursive projection approach to reduce bias are novel.

The paper proposes a new method called "Projection Regret" for novelty detection using diffusion models. The key idea is to use the diffusion model's ability to "project" out-of-distribution images to similar in-distribution images in order to reduce background bias. It computes the perceptual distance between the input and projected images as an abnormality score. The "Projection Regret" method further reduces background bias by using recursive projections and canceling out the background. Experiments show this method outperforms prior diffusion-based and other generative model-based novelty detection techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the perceptual distance between an image and its diffusion-based projection as an abnormality score. Why is perceptual distance better suited for this task compared to other metrics like MSE? What are some potential limitations of using perceptual distance?

2. The paper introduces the concept of "projection" via diffusion models. What is the intuition behind why this projection step results in an image with similar background but altered semantics? How does the projection time $t$ impact the type of changes made?

3. The core idea of Projection Regret (PR) is to cancel out background bias by comparing distances between an image and recursive projections. Explain the intuition behind why this helps reduce background bias. Are there any assumptions being made?

4. PR relies on selecting appropriate projection times $\alpha$ and $\beta$. What is the impact of these hyperparameters? How does the ensemble approach help mitigate issues with selecting suboptimal times?

5. How exactly does PR computationally leverage consistency models for efficiency? What are the tradeoffs between using consistency models versus diffusion models for projection?

6. The paper proposes a new distance metric based on U-Net decoder features. What is the motivation behind this? How does it compare to other metrics like LPIPS? What are its limitations?

7. One experiment shows PR helps on detecting out-of-distribution samples that share spurious correlations with the in-distribution data. Explain how PR is able to do this and why prior methods struggle.

8. The paper claims the background bias issue also exists in supervised learning. How exactly is the background bias problem connected between supervised and unsupervised learning?

9. What assumptions does PR make about the data? When might the method fail or struggle? For example, very high resolution images.

10. The paper uses diffusion/consistency models as a black box. What are some ways the internal behavior or training process could be adapted to potentially improve OOD detection of PR?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Novelty detection aims to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples that differ significantly from the training data distribution. Recent works have applied diffusion models for novelty detection by utilizing their ability to accurately reconstruct in-distribution samples. However, existing methods often struggle to detect OOD samples that share similar background statistics to the training data, as the reconstruction error remains small for such samples. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novelty detection method called Projection Regret (PR) to address the background bias issue in diffusion models. The key ideas are:

1) Diffusion models can project any sample, including OOD samples, to an in-distribution sample with similar backgrounds through a reverse-diffusion process from an intermediate timestep. 

2) The perceptual distance between an OOD sample and its projection mainly captures the semantic differences as their backgrounds are similar.

3) A recursive projection further cancels out background biases by comparing the distance for the original sample against that for its first projection.

Based on these ideas, PR defines an anomaly score by subtracting the projection distance of the first projected sample from the projection distance of the original sample. It uses an ensemble of projections over different timesteps to improve robustness.

Main Contributions:

- Identified the background bias issue in existing diffusion-based novelty detection methods

- Proposed the projection operation and used the perceptual distance between a sample and its projection as an effective anomaly score

- Further proposed Projection Regret to reduce background bias via recursive projections  

- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance over existing generative model based novelty detection methods on various benchmarks

- Proposed a new perceptual distance metric computed from the UNet decoder features of the diffusion model
