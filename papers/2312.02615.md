# [Projection Regret: Reducing Background Bias for Novelty Detection via   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02615)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Projection Regret (PR), a new method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using diffusion models. The key insight is that diffusion models can project any image to an in-distribution image with similar backgrounds through an intermediate diffusion and reverse process. However, metrics like pixel-wise distance often fail to capture semantic differences between images when background information dominates. To address this, PR computes the perceptual distance between a test image and its diffusion-based projection. Furthermore, PR utilizes a two-step projection to cancel out background bias by comparing the distance for the original test image against that of its first projection. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that PR significantly outperforms prior arts in diffusion and other generative model-based OOD detection. Notably, PR shows substantial gains on detecting OOD images sharing similar backgrounds to the in-distribution data. The effectiveness highlights the importance of handling background bias for OOD detection with generative models.
