# [Learning to Reduce: Optimal Representations of Structured Data in   Prompting Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14195)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 struggle to effectively incorporate structured data like knowledge graphs, tables, and databases into their prompts. Issues include:
  - Understanding lengthy text representations of the structured data
  - Selecting the most relevant evidence from the structured data prior to inference
- Both issues significantly impact the reasoning performance of LLMs on downstream QA tasks over structured data.

Proposed Solution:
- Learn to Reduce framework that trains a language model to generate a reduced version of the input context given a task description and context input.
- Uses on-policy reinforcement learning to train the model to identify the most relevant evidence from the lengthy structured data context.
- Aims to improve reasoning performance of a fixed target LLM by providing a reduced context.

Key Contributions:
- First approach to train a language model to reduce input context for structured data QA tasks.
- Model shows strong performance in selecting relevant evidence from tables, outperforming baselines like GPT-4 and tuned sequence-to-sequence models.
- Demonstrates better generalizability to unseen data distributions compared to baseline models.
- Reduced context output helps improve accuracy of target LLMs on downstream QA, especially for lengthy input contexts.
- Could serve as a pre-prompting tool to maximize reasoning ability and cost-efficiency of using LLMs for structured data QA.

In summary, the paper presents a novel Learning to Reduce approach to automatically reduce lengthy structured data context to relevant evidence. This helps improve the reasoning performance of large language models on downstream QA tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Learning to Reduce that trains a language model to generate a reduced version of a context input for a downstream task, using reinforcement learning to improve the reasoning performance of a fixed large language model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train a language model to reduce the input context of structured data QA tasks. With better model training, we expect our model could be used as a pre-prompting tool for any structured data QA tasks. This would ultimately maximize the reasoning ability of LLMs as well as the cost efficiency of using them."

In other words, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework called "Learning to Reduce" that trains a language model to generate a reduced version of the input context for structured data QA tasks. This helps improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream QA tasks by selecting the most relevant evidence from lengthy structured data before prompting the LLM.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework called "Learning to Reduce" that uses reinforcement learning to train a language model to generate a reduced version of the input context. What are the key components and training steps of this framework? Explain in detail.
