# [SeqCo-DETR: Sequence Consistency Training for Self-Supervised Object   Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08481)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design an effective self-supervised pre-training method for object detection based on transformer architectures. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. The sequence characteristics of transformers should be considered when designing self-supervised pre-training for object detection.

2. Maintaining consistency between output sequences of transformers under different views of an image can provide a simple but effective pretext task for self-supervised representation learning. 

3. Adding complementary masks on different views forces the model to rely more on global context rather than just local features for object detection.

4. Bipartite matching can optimize the sequence consistency by identifying the most relevant pairs of sequences from different views.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that a sequence consistency strategy along with complementary masking and bipartite matching can enable effective self-supervised pre-training for transformer-based object detection. The method aims to learn useful representations without relying on any manual labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes SeqCo-DETR, a novel transformer-based self-supervised learning method for object detection. The key idea is to maintain consistency between the output sequences from transformers with different image views as input. This takes advantage of the sequence characteristics of transformers for self-supervised pre-training.

- It introduces a complementary mask strategy to force the network to learn more global context information about objects. By adding complementary masks to the two image views, each branch has to rely on different non-overlapping image regions, encouraging the use of contextual information.

- It utilizes bipartite matching to find the optimal corresponding sequence pairs between the online and momentum branches. This improves the sequence consistency learning by matching the most relevant sequences. 

- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for self-supervised object detection with transformers.

In summary, the main novelty is in designing an effective pretext task and training strategy tailored for transformer-based object detectors, while prior self-supervised object detection works focus more on CNN architectures. The core idea is maintaining sequence consistency across views.
