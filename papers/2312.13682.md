# [A Constraint Programming Model for Scheduling the Unloading of Trains in   Ports: Extended](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13682)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles a real-world train scheduling problem in ports for unloading bulk cargo trains. Specifically, it focuses on scheduling the unloading operations over a 24 hour period given arriving long trains (up to 3km) that need to be split, routed to dumpers to unload the cargo, transported via conveyors, and piled onto stockpiles. This involves scheduling the trains, equipment (dumpers, conveyors, stackers), and stockpiles subject to various constraints. It is a complex combinatorial optimization problem.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a constraint programming (CP) model for this scheduling problem. The model includes decision variables like start times, end times, durations, equipment assignments for each train. It encodes various constraints like capacity limits, equipment compatibilities, splitting rules, processing times. Propagators and search heuristics are designed. The model is evaluated on real and generated problem instances. 

To improve the model, the paper analyzes the problem data and specifications in depth. This allows creating specialized constraints and propagators. For example, using compatible equipment flow tables instead of explicit equipment graph constraints. Also, a single interval vs multi-interval scheme for unary constraints is evaluated. 

The paper further enhances the model using a large neighborhood search (LNS) metaheuristic. LNS helps escape local optima by unscheduling some consecutive trains and rescheduling.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of a new real-world train scheduling problem as a CP model
- In-depth data analysis to build specialized constraints and more efficient propagators 
- Evaluation of different modeling approaches - multi-interval vs single interval unary constraints
- Enhancement of the model using LNS
- Detailed experimental analysis on real and 420 generated problem instances
- Ability to solve industrial-size instances up to 100 trains

The paper provides a reusable CP model and instance generator that can enable further research. The integration of constraint programming and metaheuristics provides an effective approach for this complex scheduling problem.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a constraint programming model for scheduling the unloading of bulk cargo trains in ports, called the SUMP (Scheduling the Unloading of Trains in Ports) problem. Specifically:

- The paper provides a detailed problem definition and analysis of the SUMP problem based on specifications from an actual bulk port. This includes describing the workflow, equipment, and constraints.

- It proposes a constraint programming model for SUMP that encodes the various constraints and requirements. The model uses interval variables, global constraints, and custom propagators.
