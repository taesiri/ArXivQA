# [PAPERCLIP: Associating Astronomical Observations and Natural Language   with Multi-Modal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is growing interest in developing custom foundation models for scientific domains like astrophysics to tackle a wide range of tasks. Astrophysics data is multi-modal, with images, spectra, text etc associated with observed objects. 
- Past work has not explored associating astronomical observations with natural language in a joint embedding space. This can enable new ways of querying data.

Method:
- The paper introduces PAPERCLIP, which fine-tunes a pre-trained image-text Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model on pairs of Hubble Space Telescope images and corresponding proposal abstract texts. 
- The abstracts are optionally summarized into structured captions describing objects/phenomena and science use cases using guided large language model generation.
- A dataset of 31k Hubble images and 4.4k abstracts is constructed. Models are trained with contrastive loss.

Results: 
- Fine-tuned models significantly outperform base CLIP on quantitative retrieval metrics and qualitative retrieval tasks. For example, models can retrieve relevant images for text queries like "dwarf galaxy", "supernova", etc.
- They demonstrate describing images via relevant text associations like objects and science use cases.

Main Contributions:
- First application of associating astronomical observations with natural language by harnessing proposal abstracts and fine-tuning foundation models.
- Demonstrates utility through improved performance on retrieval tasks over off-the-shelf CLIP.
- Opens possibilities like querying astronomical survey data with free-form language.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents PAPERCLIP, a method that fine-tunes a contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model on Hubble Space Telescope observations and corresponding proposal abstracts to learn a joint embedding space associating images and text descriptions, which is evaluated on tasks like image retrieval using natural language queries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents PAPERCLIP, a method to associate astronomical observations imaged by telescopes with natural language using a neural network model. The key contributions are:

1) Fine-tuning a pre-trained contrastive language-image model (CLIP) on a dataset of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations and corresponding proposal abstracts to learn a joint embedding space linking images and text.

2) Optionally summarizing the proposal abstracts using large language models via guided generation to provide cleaner captions. 

3) Demonstrating through quantitative retrieval metrics and qualitative retrieval examples that the fine-tuned model embodies meaningful associations between observations and text.

4) Showcasing the potential to interact with astronomical survey data in free-form natural language by querying observations using text and vice versa, enabled by the learned joint embedding space.

5) Highlighting the promise of adapting generalist foundation models to scientific domains via fine-tuning on modest amounts of domain-specific data.

In summary, the main contribution is a method to connect astronomical images and natural language descriptions that could enable more intuitive interfaces for exploring observational data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper leverages proposal abstracts as a source of text descriptions for HST images. What are some potential issues with using proposal abstracts, rather than actual descriptions of the images themselves? How could the noise in this text-image association be reduced?

2. The paper experiments with summarizing proposal abstracts using guided LLM generation. What effect does this summarization have on the information content and association with eventual observations? Could the summarization procedure be improved, and if so, how?  

3. The paper fine-tunes a pretrained CLIP model on HST images and text. What architectural modifications to CLIP could better capture distinctive characteristics of astronomical images? Are transformers the most suitable architectures?

4. How scalable is the proposed fine-tuning approach, in terms of the amount of compute and data required? Could techniques like prompt tuning help reduce compute requirements for adapting large pretrained models?

5. This work relies solely on preview images which are not science-grade. How would using science-grade observations affect the quality of fine-tuned representations? Would additional pre-processing of images be beneficial?  

6. The evaluation relies on retrieval metrics based on cosine similarity. However, embeddings with high cosine similarity may still correspond to physically different concepts. Suggest additional metrics or evaluations better capturing semantic alignment.

7. Although promising qualitative results are shown, the scale of experiments is limited. How could the approach be systematically evaluated on much larger unlabeled HST datasets to conclusively demonstrate usefulness?

8. The method only explores associations between images and text. However, other modalities like spectra are also available. How could multi-modal contrastive learning involving more than just images and text be beneficial?

9. This work relies on a small static eval/validation set. Would an actively updated validation set, focusing on misclassified examples, be helpful during training? How would you implement such an actively learned validation set?

10. The method is presented as enabling free-form natural language queries on data. However, testing is limited to simple keyword-based queries. Propose more complex, semantic query types the model should ideally be able to handle if the method is to be impactful.
