# [Transformer Multivariate Forecasting: Less is More?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multivariate time series forecasting is important but poses challenges due to complex, noisy datasets with many variables and lengthy sequences. This leads to increased errors, computational demands, and carbon footprint.
- Existing approaches to dimensionality reduction for transformer models are insufficient.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a novel framework that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting models. 

- The framework first applies PCA for dimensionality reduction on the input variables while excluding the target variable. This compressed dataset is then fed into various state-of-the-art transformer forecasting models for training and validation.

- Experiments are conducted with 5 transformer models across 4 real-world datasets. Both model perspective and dataset perspective analyses are provided.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates PCA consistently improves accuracy and efficiency across models and datasets: 
   - 33.3% MSE reduction and 49.2% faster on average from model view with PCA+Crossformer
   - 14.3% MSE reduction and 76.6% faster on Electricity dataset from data view

- Provides detailed experimental analyses and insights into model transparency and interpretability based on PCA characteristics.

- Advances state-of-the-art transformer forecasting models and establishes an effective framework for dimensionality reduction, emphasizing the principle of "less is more".

- Serves as a preliminary benchmark and stepping stone to stimulate future work on compressing both variables and longer sequences in time series forecasting.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions around a PCA-enhanced transformer forecasting framework that effectively handles the complexity of multivariate time series for higher accuracy and efficiency.
