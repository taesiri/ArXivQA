# [How to Raise a Robot -- A Case for Neuro-Symbolic AI in Constrained Task   Planning for Humanoid Assistive Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08820)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores incorporating privacy, security, and access control constraints into robot task planning approaches for future assistive humanoid robots. The authors analyze classical symbolic planning methods, which ensure constraints but face challenges scaling to handle the versatility and complexity of real-world tasks. They also examine learned neural network methods, which are more flexible and scalable but struggle to reliably enforce critical policies. Analyzing the trade-offs, they propose that hybrid neuro-symbolic methods combining neural and symbolic techniques offer the most promising path forward. Specifically, they suggest neural planning and constraints for versatility, with critical policies safeguarded by symbolic systems, arguing this brings the best of both approaches. They also highlight emerging ideas like using large language models as knowledge bases and reasoning over social norms. Overall, they present a new use case for neuro-symbolic AI in enabling future assistive robots that balance autonomy and obedience through planning systems that learn but also guarantee adherence to safety, security, and privacy rules.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Humanoid robots need autonomy to assist humans, but also need to respect safety, security and privacy constraints. Integrating such constraints into robot task planning is challenging.
- Classical symbolic planning approaches require huge manual effort to specify all possible behaviors. Neural approaches learn behaviors more easily but cannot provide guarantees on constraint satisfaction.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze tradeoffs between symbolic and neural planning approaches regarding constraint satisfaction.
- Propose a neuro-symbolic hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both. Use neural planning for versatility but critical policies enforced through symbolic constraints.  

Key Contributions:
- Show how to incorporate symbolic constraints into classical PDDL planning, but limits scalability.
- Explain learned neural planning struggles to ensure constraint satisfaction.
- Demonstrate using LLMs as planners to leverage common sense knowledge and social norms. But outputs not guaranteed valid or optimal plans.
- Present levels of neuro-symbolic integration from loose coupling to fully integrated reasoning.
- Identify challenges of distributed constraint representation, symbolic reasoning on distributions, learning symbolic knowledge.
- Conclude a hybrid system needed. Neural planning and constraints for versatility, symbolic constraints to safeguard critical policies. Ongoing advances in neuro-symbolic AI promising to make this feasible.

In summary, the paper analyzes current approaches for constrained robot task planning, identifies limitations of purely symbolic or neural methods, and advocates a neuro-symbolic hybrid system to combine strengths. This novel formulation connects access control, robotics and neuro-symbolic AI to enable future humanoid assistor robots.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores incorporating privacy, security, and access control constraints into robot task planning approaches, analyzes trade-offs of classical symbolic methods, deep neural networks, and large language models, and concludes that a neuro-symbolic hybrid approach is necessary to bring assisted living with humanoid robots into practice.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach to constrained task planning for humanoid assistive robots. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Analyzes traditional symbolic and newer neural approaches to constrained robot task planning, highlighting their respective tradeoffs in terms of scalability, flexibility, and guaranteeing constraint satisfaction.

- Discusses emerging methods like large language models and neuro-symbolic AI that can help bridge these tradeoffs.

- Concludes that a hybrid system combining neural planning for scalability with symbolic methods to enforce critical constraints is necessary to bring assisted living with humanoid robots into practice. 

- Outlines research challenges and next steps towards realizing such a neuro-symbolic system for constrained task planning that can handle the complexity of real-world deployment.

In summary, the key insight is that neither symbolic nor neural approaches alone are sufficient, but a judicious combination of both is needed to develop capable and safe assistive robots that can operate autonomously in human environments. The paper makes a case for neuro-symbolic AI as an enabling technology in this application domain.
