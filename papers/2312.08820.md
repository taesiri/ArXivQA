# [How to Raise a Robot -- A Case for Neuro-Symbolic AI in Constrained Task   Planning for Humanoid Assistive Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08820)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores incorporating privacy, security, and access control constraints into robot task planning approaches for future assistive humanoid robots. The authors analyze classical symbolic planning methods, which ensure constraints but face challenges scaling to handle the versatility and complexity of real-world tasks. They also examine learned neural network methods, which are more flexible and scalable but struggle to reliably enforce critical policies. Analyzing the trade-offs, they propose that hybrid neuro-symbolic methods combining neural and symbolic techniques offer the most promising path forward. Specifically, they suggest neural planning and constraints for versatility, with critical policies safeguarded by symbolic systems, arguing this brings the best of both approaches. They also highlight emerging ideas like using large language models as knowledge bases and reasoning over social norms. Overall, they present a new use case for neuro-symbolic AI in enabling future assistive robots that balance autonomy and obedience through planning systems that learn but also guarantee adherence to safety, security, and privacy rules.
