# [Fully Spiking Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01742)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel fully spiking denoising diffusion implicit model (FSDDIM) to enable the construction of diffusion models within spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs have the potential for extremely low energy consumption and high-speed performance on neuromorphic hardware, making them promising for computationally demanding diffusion models. The key innovation is a technique called synaptic current learning (SCL), which adopts synaptic currents rather than spike trains as model outputs. Combined with linear encoding/decoding and an SCL loss function, this allows the entire generative process of diffusion models to be completed exclusively within SNNs, without needing to decode outputs to real values at each denoising step. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for fully spiking generative models on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets. The model achieves higher image quality with fewer time steps compared to prior spiking generative models. FSDDIM represents an important step towards enabling the advantages of SNNs for diffusion models and other neural generative approaches requiring real-valued operations.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining interest due to their ability to run on neuromorphic hardware with high speed and energy efficiency. However, research on generative models using SNNs is limited.
- Diffusion models can generate high quality images but have high computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Using SNNs can potentially accelerate diffusion models.  
- However, there is a gap between diffusion models and SNNs:
    - Diffusion models estimate real-valued parameters of distributions using neural networks. 
    - SNNs output binary spike trains.
- Existing SNN diffusion models require repeatedly decoding spikes to images and sampling from distributions externally, limiting the use of SNNs.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a fully spiking diffusion model called FSDDIM based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM).
- Use synaptic currents instead of spikes as SNN outputs. Synaptic currents are real-valued signals.
- Use linear encoder and decoder to map between images and synaptic currents.
- Introduce Synaptic Current Learning (SCL) loss to enable computing DDIM's linear combination in synaptic current space, removing the need for decoding at each step.
- Show model outputting currents can be seen as model outputting spikes by fusing layers.

Main Contributions:
- First fully spiking diffusion model that completes the entire generative process using only the SNN without external decoding/sampling.
- Introduce SCL technique to train diffusion models within SNNs by using synaptic currents and linear encoding/decoding.
- Demonstrate model outperforms prior state-of-the-art fully spiking generative model in terms of image quality and number of steps.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel fully spiking diffusion model using the introduced SCL technique to address the gap between diffusion models and SNNs. It demonstrates the first complete diffusion generative process done purely within an SNN.
