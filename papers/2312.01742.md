## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel fully spiking denoising diffusion implicit model (FSDDIM) to enable the construction of diffusion models within spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs have the potential for extremely low energy consumption and high-speed performance on neuromorphic hardware, making them promising for computationally demanding diffusion models. The key innovation is a technique called synaptic current learning (SCL), which adopts synaptic currents rather than spike trains as model outputs. Combined with linear encoding/decoding and an SCL loss function, this allows the entire generative process of diffusion models to be completed exclusively within SNNs, without needing to decode outputs to real values at each denoising step. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for fully spiking generative models on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets. The model achieves higher image quality with fewer time steps compared to prior spiking generative models. FSDDIM represents an important step towards enabling the advantages of SNNs for diffusion models and other neural generative approaches requiring real-valued operations.
