# [RobustSentEmbed: Robust Sentence Embeddings Using Adversarial   Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11082)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown outstanding performance on various NLP tasks but their sentence representations lack robustness against adversarial attacks and generalization across tasks. 
- Existing PLM-based sentence embeddings are vulnerable to small perturbations in input text which can easily fool the model.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes RobustSentEmbed, a self-supervised sentence embedding framework to improve generalization and robustness.

- It generates token and sentence level adversarial perturbations using FGSM and PGD attacks. These perturbations confuse the encoder model to treat them as different instances.

- A contrastive learning objective is used alongside a replaced token detection task. This maximizes similarity between original sentence embedding and its positive pair as well as adversarial embedding to make the model robust.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive experiments show RobustSentEmbed significantly reduces attack success rates across various adversarial attacks. For e.g. BERTAttack success reduced from 75% to 39%.

- It also achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic textual similarity tasks and transfer learning tasks, outperforming prior methods.

- Thus, RobustSentEmbed generates high quality sentence embeddings with improved generalization as well as robustness against adversarial attacks, addressing limitations of prior PLM-based methods.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions through RobustSentEmbed framework which can produce robust and effective sentence representations for enhanced performance on various NLP tasks.

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces RobustSentEmbed, an innovative framework for generating sentence embeddings that are robust against adversarial attacks. Existing methods are shown to be vulnerable to such attacks.
