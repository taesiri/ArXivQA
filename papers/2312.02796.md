# [Materials Expert-Artificial Intelligence for Materials Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Discovering materials with desired properties like being topological semimetals (TSMs) is challenging due to the vast combinatorial search space. 
- Common reliance on high-throughput ab initio calculations has limitations in accuracy compared to experiments.  
- On the other hand, experts use intuition from experiences to guide decisions, but this intuition is rarely quantified.

Proposed Solution - Materials Expert-AI (ME-AI):
- Develop a machine learning approach to "bottle" expert intuition into quantifiable descriptors using expertly curated measurement-based data.  
- As a test case, focus on predicting TSMs among "square-net" materials, guided by expert-introduced "tolerance factor" descriptor.  

Contributions:
- Curated a dataset with 12 primary features for 879 square-net materials, using experimental data when possible. Labeled each as TSM or not through expert evaluation.
- Used Gaussian Process regression with a specialized kernel to reveal composite descriptors. Kernel is designed to learn interactions between features despite small dataset. 
- Reproduced tolerance factor intuitively proposed by experts. Discovered 4 new descriptors based on combining structural and chemical properties.
- New descriptors highlight critical role of "hypervalency" in enabling TSM. One purely atomic descriptor links to classical "Zintl line"chemical concept.
- Approach demonstrates promise in articulating and expanding on human expert intuition for accelerating materials discovery.

In summary, the paper presents Materials Expert-AI, a new machine learning strategy to extract and quantify human expert intuition in order to predict materials properties and accelerate discovery. They demonstrate initial success on predicting topological semimetals guided by expert knowledge, discovering new insights. The approach shows promise for synergistic human-AI collaboration.
