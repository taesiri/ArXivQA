# [Materials Expert-Artificial Intelligence for Materials Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02796)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new machine learning approach called "Materials Expert-Artificial Intelligence" (ME-AI) that aims to encapsulate human expertise and intuition into quantitative descriptors for materials discovery. The authors focus on applying ME-AI to identify descriptors for topological semimetals (TSMs) among square-net materials. They first curate an expert-labeled dataset of 12 primary features across 879 square-net compounds, using experimental data when possible. Then, they set up a Gaussian process model with a specialized kernel to reveal correlations between features. ME-AI rediscovers the previously proposed “tolerance factor” descriptor and reveals four additional descriptors related to hypervalency. One new descriptor, electronegativity times estimated FCC lattice parameter of the square-net atom, maps directly onto the extended Zintl line concept in chemistry. By projecting the materials into the space of ME-AI learned descriptors, the authors identify and correct mislabeled compounds. The success demonstrates ME-AI's ability to distill human insight into robust, physically transparent descriptors to advance data-driven materials discovery.
