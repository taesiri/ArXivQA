# [Are LLMs Effective Negotiators? Systematic Evaluation of the   Multifaceted Capabilities of LLMs in Negotiation Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Strategic conversations like negotiations demand several complex capabilities from automated systems, including comprehension of context, detecting dialogue acts, modeling the partner, and appropriate response generation. Given the remarkable language abilities exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper aims to systematically analyze how LLMs can advance the various aspects of negotiation research - from building end-to-end agents to providing pedagogical feedback. 

Methodology:
The authors design 35 tasks spread across 4 datasets that test different facets of negotiation ability aligned with 4 key competencies - Comprehension, Annotation, Partner Modeling, and Generation. The tasks are further categorized based on objectivity, time stage (start, during, and end) and difficulty level. Several LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral, etc. are evaluated on these tasks in a zero-shot setting and additionally by varying the prompting strategy.

Key Results:
1) GPT-4 outperforms other models on most objective tasks, even beating the fine-tuned Flan-T5 baseline in certain cases. However, all models struggle with subjective assessments.

2) Chain-of-thought prompting leads to huge gains for GPT-4 in arithmetic reasoning tasks. Few-shot examples also help for annotation tasks.

3) In open-ended response generation, GPT-4 performs comparably to an average human but lacks strategic reasoning. The analysis reveals issues like repetition, ignoring partner's preferences and overly agreeable behavior.

4) Additional context often confuses models about their own preferences stated explicitly. But it helps in partner modeling - indicating sophisticated context handling is still lacking.

Conclusions:
The analysis demonstrates the usefulness of LLMs for diverse negotiations use cases while also highlighting key limitations to address in future work - ensuring coherence, strategic reasoning and effectively utilizing long contexts. The authors recommend combining LLMs with specialized techniques like reinforcement learning to overcome some shortcomings.
