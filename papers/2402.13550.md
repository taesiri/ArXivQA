# [Are LLMs Effective Negotiators? Systematic Evaluation of the   Multifaceted Capabilities of LLMs in Negotiation Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Strategic conversations like negotiations demand several complex capabilities from automated systems, including comprehension of context, detecting dialogue acts, modeling the partner, and appropriate response generation. Given the remarkable language abilities exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper aims to systematically analyze how LLMs can advance the various aspects of negotiation research - from building end-to-end agents to providing pedagogical feedback. 

Methodology:
The authors design 35 tasks spread across 4 datasets that test different facets of negotiation ability aligned with 4 key competencies - Comprehension, Annotation, Partner Modeling, and Generation. The tasks are further categorized based on objectivity, time stage (start, during, and end) and difficulty level. Several LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral, etc. are evaluated on these tasks in a zero-shot setting and additionally by varying the prompting strategy.

Key Results:
1) GPT-4 outperforms other models on most objective tasks, even beating the fine-tuned Flan-T5 baseline in certain cases. However, all models struggle with subjective assessments.

2) Chain-of-thought prompting leads to huge gains for GPT-4 in arithmetic reasoning tasks. Few-shot examples also help for annotation tasks.

3) In open-ended response generation, GPT-4 performs comparably to an average human but lacks strategic reasoning. The analysis reveals issues like repetition, ignoring partner's preferences and overly agreeable behavior.

4) Additional context often confuses models about their own preferences stated explicitly. But it helps in partner modeling - indicating sophisticated context handling is still lacking.

Conclusions:
The analysis demonstrates the usefulness of LLMs for diverse negotiations use cases while also highlighting key limitations to address in future work - ensuring coherence, strategic reasoning and effectively utilizing long contexts. The authors recommend combining LLMs with specialized techniques like reinforcement learning to overcome some shortcomings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper systematically evaluates the capabilities of large language models across diverse negotiation dialogue tasks to provide insights into how they can advance different aspects of negotiation research, from building dialogue systems to providing pedagogical feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors design a novel methodology to systematically evaluate the multifaceted capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in negotiations. This methodology captures nuances common in other dialogue tasks as well.

2. The authors evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on 35 tasks based on 4 dialogue datasets capturing diverse negotiation scenarios. The overall results show the superiority of GPT-4, which often outperforms even the fine-tuned Flan-T5 baseline. 

3. Through a human evaluation, the authors find that GPT-4 performs comparably to an average crowdsourcing worker in response generation. They perform an error analysis and discuss limitations related to coherency failures and lack of strategic reasoning that persist in the compared LLMs.

4. The authors study the impact of various prompting strategies like chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting. They also provide recommendations to guide future work in this area.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel methodology to systematically probe the capabilities of LLMs in negotiations across a range of tasks, the extensive evaluation benchmarking several LLMs, and the insights gained into their strengths and limitations to guide future research.

The paper conducts a systematic analysis of the capabilities of large language models on various negotiation-related tasks. It categorizes these tasks along several key dimensions like objectivity, time stage, and task type. The analysis also explores different prompting strategies and evaluates both the objective performance as well as subjective abilities of the models related to coherency and strategic reasoning. Overall, the paper provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs when applied to complex strategic dialogues like negotiations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper categorizes the designed tasks along three key dimensions - objectivity, time stage, and task type. Can you expand more on the rationale behind choosing these specific axes for systematic task design? How do these choices enable analyzing the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs?

2. The paper evaluates both proprietary and open-source LLMs. What are some key differences in the model architectures, training objectives, and datasets used between these two categories of LLMs? How might these differences explain some of the performance gaps observed in the results? 

3. The paper finds that all models perform poorly on subjective assessments about the negotiation, exhibiting low accuracy and correlation with human judgments. What are some hypotheses that could explain this observation? How can future work address these challenges?

4. While discussing the results on annotation tasks, the paper states that models find it more difficult to detect negotiation strategies than dialogue acts. What intrinsic differences exist between these two linguistic constructs that contribute to this gap?  

5. The paper performs an error analysis on the response generation capabilities of LLMs, identifying three key categories of limitations - sophistication, failure to incorporate cues, and agreeableness. For each one, can you suggest some techniques to mitigate these issues in future work?

6. The impact of various prompting strategies is analyzed in the paper. For instance, Cot prompting is found to be highly effective for arithmetic reasoning tasks. What explanations does the paper offer for this observation? How does Cot prompting alleviate some of the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs?

7. The paper finds mixed results when using prior utterances and few-shot examples for annotation tasks. What factors would you hypothesize contribute towards whether past context and demonstrations are useful or not for a particular annotation task?

8. When analyzing the impact of the number of seen utterances, the paper finds evidence for "recency bias" in LLMs. Expand on what this means and the precise results that support this claim. How can this tendency be problematic in strategic dialogues?

9. The paper focuses only on closed-domain negotiation scenarios based on the Multi-Issue Bargaining Task framework. What are some examples of real-world aspects missed out in these abstract interactions? How would you extend the analysis to capture those complex dynamics?

10. What are some promising future directions for research at the intersection of LLMs and negotiations based on the insights gained in this work? Can you suggest 1-2 concrete ideas to either enhance LLM abilities or utilize them to tackle pertinent challenges in negotiations?
