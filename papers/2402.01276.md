# [Federated Unlearning: a Perspective of Stability and Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative training of a shared global model while keeping data decentralized. However, with increasing privacy regulations, users may later request for their data to be "forgotten" from the model. This gives rise to the need for federated unlearning (FU).

- FU in FL faces new challenges compared to traditional centralized unlearning, primarily due to inherent data heterogeneity across clients. Specifically, the paper identifies two key issues:
  1) Unlearning certain clients can unequally impact the performance of remaining clients ("local fairness" issue)
  2) Unlearning different clients can divergently impact overall model performance ("global stability" issue)

- There is currently a lack of rigorous understanding and analysis on how data heterogeneity affects unlearning in the federated context. The paper thus asks: How to assess the consequences of FU and balance the inherent trade-offs?

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces quantitative metrics to evaluate FU mechanisms:
  - FU Verification metric: measures how well unlearning removes influence
  - Global Stability metric: evaluates performance impact on whole model 
  - Local Fairness metric: captures unequal impacts on remaining clients

- Provides an optimization framework and penalty-based method to balance trade-offs in FU verification vs. global stability

- Proposes constraint-based optimization approach to balance trade-off between FU verification and local fairness  

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of how data heterogeneity affects unlearning, and inherent trade-offs in federated unlearning
- Quantitative metrics for evaluating federated unlearning mechanisms
- Optimization frameworks with stability control and fairness constraints to balance identified trade-offs
- Theoretical analysis of convergence bounds and trade-off relations in proposed federated unlearning mechanisms
- Empirical validation of proposed methods in balancing trade-offs for non-convex models over heterogeneous data distributions

The paper provides important theoretical groundwork along with practical insights and mechanisms for understanding and managing the impacts of data heterogeneity in federated unlearning.
