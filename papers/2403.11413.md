# [Dynamic Contexts for Generating Suggestion Questions in RAG Based   Conversational Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational agents rely heavily on users to formulate effective queries, but users often struggle to understand the system's capabilities leading to poor or ambiguous questions. 
- This results in uninformative responses or apologies from the agent, forcing users to repeatedly refine their queries.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a suggestion question generator to provide users with answerable follow-up questions based on their initial query. 
- Use a dynamic context prompt consisting of:
  - Dynamic few-shot examples: Relevant (query, answer, suggestion question) triplets selected based on the user's query
  - Dynamically retrieved contexts: Relevant passages from the dataset based on the user's query
- Generate suggestion questions using in-context learning without needing extensive model training.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a suggestion question generator to address the gap in user awareness of an agent's capabilities
- Formulate the generator for low-resource settings, applicable across datasets without fine-tuning
- Introduce a dynamic context prompt with dynamic few-shot examples and retrieved contexts to generate better suggestion questions
- Show through experiments that the dynamic contexts approach produces more relevant and correct suggestion questions compared to other prompting strategies

The paper demonstrates the potential of using dynamic contexts in a retrieval-augmented generative setup to produce useful suggestion questions that clarify ambiguous user queries and enhance the conversational flow.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a suggestion question generator for conversational agents that uses dynamic few-shot examples and dynamically retrieved contexts to generate relevant and answerable follow-up questions when users ask ambiguous queries the agent cannot interpret.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a suggestion question generator to improve user experience with conversational agents. Specifically:

1) It proposes a framework to generate suggestion questions that are answerable by the conversational agent, guided by the user's initial query. This aims to address cases where the user query is ambiguous or poorly defined. 

2) It formulates the suggestion question generation task in a low-resource setting using in-context learning, without needing extensive model training.

3) It introduces a dynamic context prompt consisting of dynamically selected few-shot examples and dynamically retrieved contexts. This prompt is used to generate the suggestion questions.

So in summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to generate personalized suggestion questions to improve conversational flow, requiring minimal training data. The core ideas are using dynamic prompts and in-context learning to achieve this.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Conversational agents/systems
- Question generation
- Suggestion question generation
- Prompting
- Few-shot learning
- Dynamic contexts
- Dynamic few-shot examples
- Dynamically retrieved contexts
- In-context learning
- Clarification questions

The paper focuses on using a dynamic contexts approach consisting of dynamic few-shot examples and dynamically retrieved contexts to generate suggestion questions in RAG-based conversational systems. This aims to address cases where users have difficulty properly formulating queries that conversational agents can understand and respond to. The approach utilizes few-shot in-context learning without needing extensive model training. Overall, the key ideas have to do with leveraging RAG, question/suggestion question generation, dynamic contexts, and prompting techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a "dynamic contexts" approach for generating suggestion questions. Can you explain in more detail how the dynamic few-shot examples are selected? What criteria or similarity metrics are used to choose relevant examples based on the initial user query?

2. How exactly are the "dynamically retrieved contexts" extracted and chosen? Does this leverage some form of information retrieval or passage ranking model? What are the key relevance indicators used? 

3. The prompt structure combines the dynamic few-shot examples and retrieved contexts. Can you elaborate on how this prompt is formatted? Are there any special delimiters or syntax used to differentiate the examples versus contexts?

4. The evaluation employs manual assessment of the generated suggestion questions. What were some of the key criteria used to evaluate the correctness, relevance and soundness of the questions? Can you define or elaborate on those criteria?

5. For the comparative analysis against other prompting strategies, what specifically was varied in the zero-shot, few-shot, and dynamic few-shot baseline prompts? Can you show some examples of those prompts?

6. The paper mentions that ChatGPT and GPT-4 struggled with some age-related errors. What caused these errors and why do you think numerical reasoning is challenging for LLMs in this context? 

7. For the preference benchmarking evaluation, what guidelines or criteria were given to the LLMs when judging the quality of the suggestion questions? How was the evaluation framed?

8. The dynamic contexts approach is meant to reduce apologies and improve user experience. Do you have any quantitative metrics or surveys to demonstrate this enhancement of user satisfaction? 

9. Could this approach work for non-RAG conversational systems? What components are specific to RAGs versus more general conversation models?

10. For future work, you propose personalizing suggestion questions based on user history. Can you elaborate on how user interactions and dialog history could inform the dynamic contexts and examples?
