# [Curriculum Learning for Cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11768)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to study curriculum learning for training reinforcement learning agents to cooperate in multi-agent settings. Specifically, it examines the following key questions:

1) What makes a good teammate when a learning agent (student) has to cooperate with another pre-trained non-learning agent (teammate)? 

2) How to construct an effective curriculum of teammates with varying skill levels to train the student agent?

3) How do different teammate curricula affect the student's learning ability and team performance?

Methodology:
The authors conduct experiments in the cooperative Overcooked environment with two agents. They first train two agents simultaneously to create a population of teammates with policies snapshotted at different skill levels. The student agent is then trained from scratch with three setups: 

1) Pairing with a fixed non-learning teammate that is pre-trained to either low, medium or high skill level.

2) Curriculum with increasing teammate skill over training episodes.  

3) Curriculum with decreasing teammate skill over episodes.

Key Results:
- A less-skilled fixed teammate leads to highest team reward but poorest student learning. A medium-skilled teammate balances both objectives best.

- In general, curricula with pre-trained teammates outperform training with a co-learning agent.

- A curriculum with decreasing teammate skill works well to optimize both team reward and student learning compared to increasing curriculum. The reasoning is that a less-skilled teammate allows the student to learn the task better initially.

Main Contributions:
- First empirical analysis and insights on good teammates and teammate curricula for cooperative multi-agent RL.

- Key result that a curriculum with decreasing teammate skill can enable efficient student learning and team performance.

- The analysis and results establish strong baselines and motivation for future research directions in this area.
