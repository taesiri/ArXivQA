# [Team Formation amidst Conflicts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00859)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of team formation amidst conflicts. Specifically, given a set of individuals that need to be assigned to teams/tasks with limited capacities, the goal is to find an assignment that maximizes the satisfaction of the individuals. The satisfaction depends on two factors: (1) their preferences over the tasks, and (2) the conflicts between the assigned individuals. Conflicts are modeled via a conflict graph between the individuals. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper formulates the problem as an integer quadratic program that is shown to be NP-hard. To solve it approximately, a two-step framework based on convex relaxation and dependent rounding is proposed. In the first step, the original objective is replaced by a concave relaxation that matches the original objective on integral solutions. This relaxation is optimized efficiently using gradient ascent. In the second step, the fractional solution is rounded to an integral solution using techniques like pipage rounding or randomized pipage rounding.

Two instantiations of this framework are presented along with their approximation guarantees:

1. A 1/2-approximation algorithm using pipage rounding

2. A 3/4-approximation algorithm using randomized pipage rounding  

Additionally, several speed-up techniques like linearization, sparsification and graph compaction are proposed to scale up the algorithms.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of the novel and versatile team formation problem that can model various real-world scenarios

- An algorithmic framework for approximating the problem based on convex relaxation and dependent rounding

- Two concrete instantiations with pipage rounding (1/2 approx.) and randomized pipage rounding (3/4 approx.) 

- Practical speed-up techniques to scale the algorithms 

- Extensive evaluation on real datasets demonstrating effectiveness over baselines and human experts

The main highlight is the application of advanced techniques like dependent rounding to a practical problem and demonstrating their effectiveness on real data. The framework is general and can capture various application domains.
