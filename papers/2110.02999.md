# [Generative Modeling with Optimal Transport Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02999)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper does not seem to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, based on my reading, the main focus appears to be developing and evaluating a method to learn optimal transport maps for generative modeling. Specifically, the paper proposes an end-to-end algorithm to compute optimal transport maps between distributions, including the case when the input and output distributions have unequal dimensionality. The method is evaluated on tasks like image generation and unpaired image restoration.The key contributions seem to be:1) Deriving an optimization algorithm to compute optimal transport maps for quadratic cost (Wasserstein-2 distance) between equal dimensional distributions.2) Extending the approach to handle unequal input/output dimensions and analyzing the theoretical error bounds. 3) Demonstrating the application of optimal transport maps for generative modeling on large-scale datasets like CelebA faces.4) Showing the utility of optimal maps for unpaired learning tasks like image denoising, colorization, inpainting where optimality provides useful inductive bias.In summary, the main focus is on developing a practical method for learning optimal transport maps and demonstrating its effectiveness for generative modeling compared to prior approaches. The paper does not seem to have an explicit central hypothesis it is trying to validate.
