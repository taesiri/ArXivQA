# [Upper Bound of Bayesian Generalization Error in Partial Concept   Bottleneck Model (CBM): Partial CBM outperforms naive CBM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are a type of interpretable neural network where concept variables are inserted between the output and the last hidden layer. These concepts aim to capture the "reasons" behind the network's predictions.
- However, standard CBMs require observing all concept variables, which decreases model generalization performance. Partial CBMs (PCBMs) use partially observed concepts to help resolve this.
- Though experiments suggest PCBMs outperform standard CBMs in generalization, there is no theoretical analysis clarifying the behavior of the generalization error since PCBMs involve singular statistical models. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper theoretically analyzes the Bayesian generalization error for PCBMs using a 3-layer linear architecture via the Singular Learning Theory. 
- They derive an upper bound for the PCBM Real Log Canonical Threshold (RLCT, which characterizes the generalization error rate) in terms of the RLCT of a standard neural network and an additional term that depends on the number of observed concept variables.
- This demonstrates PCBMs theoretically outperform CBMs in generalization since the PCBM RLCT upper bound is less than the exact CBM RLCT. The difference quantifies the degree of improved generalization.

Main Contributions:
- First theoretical analysis clarifying the behavior of the Bayesian generalization error for PCBMs using singular learning theory.
- Proof that PCBMs outperform CBMs in generalization for 3-layer linear models along with quantifying the degree of improvement.
- Upper bound for the PCBM RLCT based on the neural network and CBM RLCTs. Can be extended to categorical variables.
- Lays groundwork for theoretically analyzing concept bottleneck architectures and effects on generalization capabilities.
