## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more challenging and realistic benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities, beyond just natural images. 
- Existing benchmarks have limitations: focus too narrowly or simplistically, rely on multiple choice questions, insufficient to assess full comprehension.
- Need a more robust, diverse, and multifaceted dataset to effectively evaluate MLLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce MULTI, a novel Chinese multimodal QA benchmark with 18,430 scientific questions in diverse formats to test MLLMs.
- Sources: exams, quizzes, textbooks, annotated by experts over multiple rounds to ensure quality.
- Covers range of scientific subjects (math, physics, etc.) and question types (multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, open-ended). 
- Includes over 10K analysis/explanations and 7.7K images to require visual understanding.
- Subsets: MultiHard (500 tough questions) and MultiKN (4.5K knowledge pieces) specifically test limits and learning capabilities of MLLMs.

Key Contributions:  
- Propose comprehensive, challenging MULTI benchmark to push frontiers of multimodal LLMs
- Introduce MultiHard and MultiKN to enable more nuanced evaluation 
- Experiment with state-of-the-art MLLMs, analyze performance across question types/subjects, reveal current gaps to human performance
- Make benchmark suite and leaderboard publicly available to advance research 

The paper introduces a much needed multifaceted, multimodal benchmark that overcomes limitations of existing QA datasets. Detailed experiments demonstrate significant room for advancing MLLMs to reach human-level comprehension and reasoning. The public release of this benchmark aims to spur innovation in this critical research direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes the following main contributions:

1. It proposes MULTI, a substantial and challenging multimodal benchmark focusing on Chinese scientific questions, designed to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs). 

2. It introduces MULTI-hard and MULTI-kn subsets to test models' bottleneck abilities and in-context learning capabilities, aiming for more nuanced evaluation of MLLMs. 

3. It presents detailed experiments with various state-of-the-art multimodal and single-modality LLMs on MULTI, providing both qualitative and quantitative insights into their performance. 

4. It makes the MULTI leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and the two subsets available to the research community, encouraging further participation and advancement in the field of multimodal LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of the comprehensive MULTI benchmark and associated resources to push forward research on evaluating and improving multimodal large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- MULTI - The name of the proposed benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Stands for "Multimodal Understanding Leaderboard with Text and Images".

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the MULTI benchmark compare to other existing multimodal benchmarks in terms of coverage of question types and subjects? What unique capabilities does it offer over other benchmarks?

2. What were some of the key strategies used in the data construction process for MULTI, such as the algorithmic selection of questions and multiple rounds of human annotation? How do these strategies ensure diversity and quality?  

3. The MULTI-Hard and MULTI-Kn subsets seem crucial for testing models more rigorously. Can you elaborate on the key ideas behind curating these specialized subsets and how they enable deeper evaluation?

4. The paper mentions assessing open-ended writing tasks remains an open challenge. What kinds of automatic evaluation metrics could be suitable for these tasks? Are there any recent advances in this area worth exploring?  

5. Could the annotated explanations in the MULTI benchmark be utilized more effectively for model training via methods like CoT? What benefits might this provide?

6. How suitable is the MULTI benchmark for evaluating multilingual capabilities of models? What provisions need to be made to test models trained primarily on non-Chinese datasets?  

7. What additional modalities could be incorporated into the MULTI benchmark to make it more comprehensive, such as audio, video or interactive elements? What would be the key challenges?

8. The exact match metric used for fill-in-the-blank questions seems quite stringent. Would using fuzzy matching provide better insights into the model's capabilities?

9. How can the MULTI benchmark be adapted to test MLLMs on a wider range of specialized domains like medicine, arts or law? What data collection strategies seem promising?

10. Are there any other recent MLLM models with advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities worth evaluating on this benchmark for the leaderboard?
