# [StyleDyRF: Zero-shot 4D Style Transfer for Dynamic Neural Radiance   Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08310)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "StyleDyRF: Zero-shot 4D Style Transfer for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields":

Problem:
- The paper tackles the novel challenge of zero-shot 4D style transfer, which aims to transfer arbitrary visual styles to the synthesized novel views of a dynamic 4D scene with varying viewpoints and times. 
- This is more challenging than existing 3D style transfer methods that assume a static scene. 4D scenes with dynamic objects can corrupt the static assumptions in prior works and cause poor rendering quality and consistency.

Proposed Method: StyleDyRF
- Represents the 4D feature space compactly using a canonical 3D feature volume and a deformation network that handles object motions.
- Learns a linear style transformation matrix on the canonical feature volume that ensures consistency across time.
- The canonical feature volume is distilled by deforming rays using the deformation network and rendering features supervised by a 2D feature autoencoder.
- The transformation matrix is estimated in a data-driven way using lightweight networks on the canonical volume and style image. This matches the feature covariance for style transfer.
- An additional propagation network can be added for photo-realistic stylization.

Main Contributions:
- First work to tackle the novel problem of zero-shot 4D style transfer with consistency across views and time.
- Introduces a compact canonical space formulation to represent 4D dynamic scenes.
- Learns a canonical style transformation matrix for consistent stylization.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual quality, multi-view consistency and temporal consistency.

In summary, the paper proposes a new method StyleDyRF to achieve high-quality and consistent stylized novel view rendering for 4D dynamic scenes in a zero-shot generalization manner. The key ideas are the canonical space formulation and global style transformation design.
