# [Where It Really Matters: Few-Shot Environmental Conservation Media   Monitoring for Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11818)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Environmental conservation organizations need to monitor news media to maintain awareness of developments that can impact the environment. However, manually reading news articles is extremely labor-intensive. Existing automated systems require large labeled datasets, which is infeasible for local low-resource languages prevalent in regions where such systems are most needed.

Proposed Solution - NewsSerow:
The authors propose NewsSerow, a multilingual few-shot classification framework to identify news articles relevant to environmental conservation efforts. Key aspects include:

1) Summarization Module: Generates 3-sentence summaries of articles using GPT-3.5-Turbo's zero-shot capabilities. Allows full articles to fit within classification prompt's context window.

2) Classification Module: Performs in-context learning using 10 labeled example articles. Uses chain-of-thought prompting for the model to provide explanations. Labels test articles as relevant or not relevant. 

3) Reflection Module: Further prompts the model on positively labeled articles to double check correctness of classification. Acts as precision-recall switch.

The full pipeline significantly outperforms other few-shot methods for Nepali news articles. With only 10 examples, it achieves comparable performance to models trained on 1800+ examples.

Main Contributions:
1) Enables low-resource language news monitoring with very limited labeled data, crucial for conservation efforts in local contexts. 
2) Novel pipeline using summarization, in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning and reflection.
3) Deployed by WWF country offices in Nepal and Colombia, reducing monitoring burden.

The summary covers the key problem being solved, the proposed NewsSerow solution and its novel components, its demonstrated performance improvements compared to other methods, and its real-world usage and impact.
