# [Movie Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03705)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: How can we develop effective methods for generating natural language descriptions of movies based on audio descriptions (ADs) and movie scripts? 

More specifically, the key questions and goals seem to be:

- How can ADs and movie scripts be collected, aligned to video clips, and used as training data for generating movie descriptions? The paper presents new datasets collected for this purpose - the MPII Movie Description dataset (MPII-MD) and Montreal Video Annotation Dataset (M-VAD).

- How do ADs compare to movie scripts as a data source for video description? The paper analyzes differences between ADs and scripts and finds ADs tend to be more visually grounded and precise.

- How can robust visual classifiers be learned from the weak annotations in ADs/scripts to support video description? The paper proposes an approach to select semantically meaningful visual labels and learn separate classifiers.

- How can Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks be effectively applied to generate movie descriptions based on visual classifiers? The paper explores different LSTM architectures and training procedures for this task.

- What is the current performance of video description methods on movies and where do they still fail? The paper analyzes and compares different methods to shed light on remaining challenges.

So in summary, the key research goals are developing datasets for movie description, understanding differences between ADs and scripts, learning visual classifiers from weak annotations, applying LSTMs for description generation, and analyzing performance of current methods to determine remaining challenges. The paper aims to advance movie description through datasets, methods, and analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The introduction of two new datasets for movie description:
- The MPII Movie Description (MPII-MD) dataset containing aligned audio descriptions (ADs) and movie scripts.
- The Montreal Video Annotation Dataset (M-VAD) containing only aligned ADs. 

2. The combined Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) dataset which brings together MPII-MD, M-VAD, and additional movies into a unified dataset for the challenge.

3. A proposed approach called Visual-Labels that uses robust visual classifiers for verbs, objects, and places as input to an LSTM network for generating movie descriptions. Experiments are presented analyzing different choices for the classifiers and LSTM architecture.

4. Benchmarking of the Visual-Labels approach along with other methods on the new datasets using automatic metrics and human evaluation. The Visual-Labels approach is shown to outperform prior work.

5. An analysis is provided of where current methods succeed and fail on the movie description task using the new datasets. The challenges of diversity, visual concepts, sentence complexity, etc. are discussed.

6. Organization of the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge at ICCV 2015 using the new LSMDC dataset and presentation of results from different teams.

So in summary, the key contributions are the introduction of the new datasets, the proposed Visual-Labels approach, benchmarking and analysis of methods using the datasets, and organization of the challenge for movie description.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading, a one-sentence summary of the key points of this paper could be:

The paper introduces a new large-scale movie description dataset called LSMDC, containing over 100k clips aligned with sentences from audio descriptions and scripts, and benchmarks several approaches for automatically generating descriptions of movie clips using this data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of video description and generation:

- Dataset: The paper introduces the LSMDC dataset, which contains over 200 movies with over 118K aligned video clips and sentences. This is a larger and more diverse dataset compared to many previous video description datasets like MSVD, M-VAD, and MPII-MD. The scale and diversity of LSMDC allows for training more robust models.

- Realism: The LSMDC dataset uses clips and descriptions from movies, which are more realistic and open-domain compared to datasets based on YouTube clips or constrained domains like cooking. The descriptions come from audio descriptions for the blind, which tend to focus on visual elements. 

- Models: The paper benchmarks several models for video description like retrieval, SMT-based, and LSTM-based. The proposed Visual-Labels + LSTM model outperforms prior work by using robust visual classifiers tailored to semantic groups. This demonstrates better techniques for handling weak sentence annotations.

- Analysis: The paper provides an extensive analysis of where different methods succeed or fail, based on sentence length, word frequency, verb semantics, etc. This sheds light on the remaining challenges in this domain.

- Evaluation: The paper introduces the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The challenge setting allows systematic comparison of different approaches on this dataset.

Overall, the realism and scale of the LSMDC dataset, combined with rigorous benchmarking and analysis, represents an important advance for the field of video and movie description compared to prior smaller or constrained datasets. The analysis also points to remaining challenges around long-tail distributions and capturing diverse verbs/actions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of concepts in movies. The authors note that additional training data cannot fully solve this issue, since new movies may contain novel parts. They suggest exploring techniques like relying on different modalities (e.g. audio or subtitles in addition to video) to help address this challenge.

- Experimenting with different evaluation criteria for movie description. The paper showed human judgments can be sensitive to how the evaluation question is formulated. The authors suggest exploring alternate criteria beyond the typical correctness/grammar/relevance measures.

- Moving beyond single sentence description to multi-sentence descriptions and stories. The movie description dataset could enable research on understanding plots and narrative structures across multiple sentences. 

- Applying the dataset to related tasks like learning joint video-text embeddings or visual question answering about movies, which go beyond description generation.

- Addressing the limitation that current methods tend to focus on common visual concepts and language, while ignoring the long tail. New techniques are needed to expand the diversity of generated descriptions.

- Incorporating other modalities like audio, subtitles, etc. along with video, which can provide additional context and information.

- Developing better evaluation metrics for video/movie description that have higher correlation with human judgments.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) dataset, which contains over 100,000 sentences aligned to video clips from over 200 movies. The sentences are sourced from audio descriptions for the blind (ADs) and movie scripts. The authors compare ADs to scripts and find ADs tend to be more precise and relevant. They benchmark several approaches on the dataset including a semantic parsing + SMT method and their own Visual-Labels LSTM approach which relies on robust visual classifiers as input. They held a challenge at ICCV 2015 where teams competed to automatically generate descriptions for clips from the blind test set. The Visual-Labels and S2VT approaches produced longer, more diverse descriptions but had more errors, while the Frame-Video-Concept Fusion approach produced simpler, cleaner descriptions and scored best in human evaluation. Overall, generating good open domain movie descriptions remains challenging due to the long tail distribution of concepts. The authors plan to extend the challenge and hope the dataset enables future research on plot and story understanding.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents the LSMDC dataset for movie description consisting of audio descriptions and movie scripts aligned to video clips. The dataset contains 118,114 sentences aligned to 118,081 clips from 202 movies totaling 158 hours of video. Audio descriptions are found to be more precise and relevant for describing the visual content compared to movie scripts. Several approaches for generating video descriptions are benchmarked on the dataset including retrieval, an SMT-based approach, and an LSTM model using robust visual classifiers as input. The LSTM approach outperforms prior work, but analyzing the outputs reveals remaining challenges due to dataset biases and difficulties in modeling the long tail of concepts. The LSMDC challenge held at ICCV 2015 is also presented, where a submission using CNN and dense trajectory features was found to produce the best human rankings. Overall, the LSMDC dataset enables research on video understanding using natural language. Key remaining challenges are identified such as handling the long tail distribution of concepts and exploring multi-modal techniques.

In summary, the key contributions of the paper are:

-Presenting the large-scale LSMDC dataset containing over 100k sentences aligned to clips from 202 movies.

-Comparing audio descriptions to movie scripts and finding audio descriptions are more precise and relevant. 

-Benchmarking retrieval, SMT, and LSTM approaches for movie description, with the LSTM approach outperforming prior work.

-Analyzing remaining challenges on the dataset related to dataset bias and modeling the long tail of concepts.

-Discussing the results of the LSMDC challenge identifying strengths and weaknesses of current methods. 

-Identifying key future work such as multi-modal techniques and better handling of the long tail.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) dataset which contains over 100,000 sentences aligned to video clips from 202 movies. The dataset is constructed from two sources - audio descriptions (AD) for the visually impaired, and movie scripts. The AD data is automatically segmented from the movie audio track using vocal isolation techniques, then manually aligned to the video clips. The script data is aligned using subtitle matching. For the LSMDC challenge, the authors benchmark several approaches on the dataset. Their proposed Visual-Labels method first extracts verbs, objects, and places from the sentences using a semantic parser. It trains SVM classifiers for each label type using appropriate visual features. The classifier scores are input to an LSTM network which is trained to generate descriptions. They experiment with LSTM architectures and dropout regularization to improve performance. The S2VT model is also evaluated which encodes video frames with an LSTM and decodes to sentences. Their analysis shows the difficulty of movie description due to diversity and long-tail distributions. The LSMDC challenge evaluates different methods using automatic metrics and human rankings, finding a tradeoff between diversity and correctness. Overall, the paper introduces a large-scale movie description dataset and benchmarks methods for generating open-domain multi-sentence video descriptions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper addresses the problem of generating automatic descriptions for videos, specifically for movies. The authors note that while audio descriptions (ADs) created for movies provide useful aligned text data, prior works have not effectively leveraged this data. 

The main questions addressed in the paper are:

- How can AD data, as well as movie scripts, be effectively collected and aligned to videos to create a dataset for movie description?

- How can semantic parsing be used to extract useful labels from the aligned sentences to train visual classifiers? 

- How can Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks be designed and trained to leverage the visual classifier scores to generate automatic movie descriptions?

- How do different methods for movie description, including nearest neighbor retrieval, an SMT-based approach, and the proposed LSTM approach, compare in performance on the collected datasets?

- What are the remaining challenges in movie description, based on an analysis of where current methods fail?

So in summary, the key focus is on developing datasets and models for the challenging movie description task, with a particular emphasis on using audio descriptions.
