# [Movie Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03705)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: How can we develop effective methods for generating natural language descriptions of movies based on audio descriptions (ADs) and movie scripts? More specifically, the key questions and goals seem to be:- How can ADs and movie scripts be collected, aligned to video clips, and used as training data for generating movie descriptions? The paper presents new datasets collected for this purpose - the MPII Movie Description dataset (MPII-MD) and Montreal Video Annotation Dataset (M-VAD).- How do ADs compare to movie scripts as a data source for video description? The paper analyzes differences between ADs and scripts and finds ADs tend to be more visually grounded and precise.- How can robust visual classifiers be learned from the weak annotations in ADs/scripts to support video description? The paper proposes an approach to select semantically meaningful visual labels and learn separate classifiers.- How can Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks be effectively applied to generate movie descriptions based on visual classifiers? The paper explores different LSTM architectures and training procedures for this task.- What is the current performance of video description methods on movies and where do they still fail? The paper analyzes and compares different methods to shed light on remaining challenges.So in summary, the key research goals are developing datasets for movie description, understanding differences between ADs and scripts, learning visual classifiers from weak annotations, applying LSTMs for description generation, and analyzing performance of current methods to determine remaining challenges. The paper aims to advance movie description through datasets, methods, and analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The introduction of two new datasets for movie description:- The MPII Movie Description (MPII-MD) dataset containing aligned audio descriptions (ADs) and movie scripts.- The Montreal Video Annotation Dataset (M-VAD) containing only aligned ADs. 2. The combined Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) dataset which brings together MPII-MD, M-VAD, and additional movies into a unified dataset for the challenge.3. A proposed approach called Visual-Labels that uses robust visual classifiers for verbs, objects, and places as input to an LSTM network for generating movie descriptions. Experiments are presented analyzing different choices for the classifiers and LSTM architecture.4. Benchmarking of the Visual-Labels approach along with other methods on the new datasets using automatic metrics and human evaluation. The Visual-Labels approach is shown to outperform prior work.5. An analysis is provided of where current methods succeed and fail on the movie description task using the new datasets. The challenges of diversity, visual concepts, sentence complexity, etc. are discussed.6. Organization of the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge at ICCV 2015 using the new LSMDC dataset and presentation of results from different teams.So in summary, the key contributions are the introduction of the new datasets, the proposed Visual-Labels approach, benchmarking and analysis of methods using the datasets, and organization of the challenge for movie description.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading, a one-sentence summary of the key points of this paper could be:The paper introduces a new large-scale movie description dataset called LSMDC, containing over 100k clips aligned with sentences from audio descriptions and scripts, and benchmarks several approaches for automatically generating descriptions of movie clips using this data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of video description and generation:- Dataset: The paper introduces the LSMDC dataset, which contains over 200 movies with over 118K aligned video clips and sentences. This is a larger and more diverse dataset compared to many previous video description datasets like MSVD, M-VAD, and MPII-MD. The scale and diversity of LSMDC allows for training more robust models.- Realism: The LSMDC dataset uses clips and descriptions from movies, which are more realistic and open-domain compared to datasets based on YouTube clips or constrained domains like cooking. The descriptions come from audio descriptions for the blind, which tend to focus on visual elements. - Models: The paper benchmarks several models for video description like retrieval, SMT-based, and LSTM-based. The proposed Visual-Labels + LSTM model outperforms prior work by using robust visual classifiers tailored to semantic groups. This demonstrates better techniques for handling weak sentence annotations.- Analysis: The paper provides an extensive analysis of where different methods succeed or fail, based on sentence length, word frequency, verb semantics, etc. This sheds light on the remaining challenges in this domain.- Evaluation: The paper introduces the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The challenge setting allows systematic comparison of different approaches on this dataset.Overall, the realism and scale of the LSMDC dataset, combined with rigorous benchmarking and analysis, represents an important advance for the field of video and movie description compared to prior smaller or constrained datasets. The analysis also points to remaining challenges around long-tail distributions and capturing diverse verbs/actions.
