# Instruct2Act: Mapping Multi-modality Instructions to Robotic Actions   with Large Language Model

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, it seems this paper presents a framework called Instruct2Act that allows robots to execute tasks based on multi-modality instructions (e.g. natural language, images). The key aspects appear to be:- Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to map instructions to robotic actions/programs. The LLMs generate Python code that calls different modules to perceive the environment and plan/execute actions.- Leveraging visual foundation models like SAM for segmentation and CLIP for classification to understand objects in the environment. These models provide visual perception abilities.- Supporting flexible instruction modalities like language, language+image, or pointing+language. A modular retrieval architecture handles the different input types.- Evaluating the approach on a variety of manipulation tasks from the VIMABench benchmark. The main hypothesis seems to be that combining LLMs and visual foundation models in this framework can enable effective robotic task execution from high-level instructions with minimal training or fine-tuning. The results appear to validate this, showing strong performance compared to prior learning-based methods.In summary, the key research question is whether this instructable robot framework combining LLMs and visual models can succeed at complex instruction-following with zero-shot generalization, and the experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel framework called \texttt{Instruct2Act} that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to map multi-modality instructions to sequential actions for robotic manipulation tasks. 2.

It leverages the expertise of visual foundation models like SAM and CLIP through APIs, while generating policies using the LLM's ability for in-context learning.3. Demonstrating the flexibility of the framework in handling different instruction modalities like natural language, visual inputs, and pointing instructions. A unified retrieval architecture is presented to handle these varying inputs.4. Evaluating the framework on a range of robotic manipulation tasks and showing strong zero-shot performance that exceeds prior learning-based methods on several tasks. The approach also shows good generalization ability.5. Providing the full framework code to serve as a benchmark for robotic instruction following tasks with diverse modality inputs.In summary, the key contribution is presenting a novel framework for generating robotic policies from multifaceted instructions, while maintaining flexibility, leverage of foundation models, strong zero-shot ability and generalization. The code release also enables it to be a valuable benchmark for future research.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in the field:- This paper presents a novel framework for utilizing large language models (LLMs) to map multi-modal instructions to robotic manipulation actions. The use of LLMs and foundation models for language-conditioned robotics has been an active area of research, with approaches like CLIPORT, SayCan, etc. However, this framework incorporates multiple foundation models (SAM, CLIP) and leverages their strengths in a flexible way through API access. The modular API-based approach allows easy incorporation of improved foundation models in the future.- A key contribution is the ability to handle diverse instruction modalities like natural language, visual, and pointing instructions in a unified manner. Most prior work has focused on a single modality like language or vision. The proposed flexible retrieval architecture enables handling of varied inputs.- The framework achieves strong zero-shot generalization ability on a range of robotic manipulation tasks from the VIMABench benchmark. This is significant given that most prior approaches require training on task demonstrations. The competitive performance to learning-based methods highlights the generalization capacity of foundation models.- Compared to end-to-end policy learning methods, this framework requires minimal training and preserves interpretability via the LLM-generated Python code. However, the computational overhead of using multiple foundation models may limit real-time application.- Overall, the incorporation of LLMs and visual foundation models in a flexible API-based architecture enables strong generalization on robotic tasks from diverse instruction modalities. The proposed system pushes the boundaries of language-conditioned policies and provides a robust benchmark for robotic instruction following.In summary, the key innovations of this work include the unified handling of diverse input modalities, competitive zero-shot performance, and the flexible integration of multiple foundation models in a modular and interpretable way. The framework represents an advance in building generalized robotic systems using language guidance.
