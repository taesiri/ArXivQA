# Instruct2Act: Mapping Multi-modality Instructions to Robotic Actions   with Large Language Model

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, it seems this paper presents a framework called Instruct2Act that allows robots to execute tasks based on multi-modality instructions (e.g. natural language, images). The key aspects appear to be:- Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to map instructions to robotic actions/programs. The LLMs generate Python code that calls different modules to perceive the environment and plan/execute actions.- Leveraging visual foundation models like SAM for segmentation and CLIP for classification to understand objects in the environment. These models provide visual perception abilities.- Supporting flexible instruction modalities like language, language+image, or pointing+language. A modular retrieval architecture handles the different input types.- Evaluating the approach on a variety of manipulation tasks from the VIMABench benchmark. The main hypothesis seems to be that combining LLMs and visual foundation models in this framework can enable effective robotic task execution from high-level instructions with minimal training or fine-tuning. The results appear to validate this, showing strong performance compared to prior learning-based methods.In summary, the key research question is whether this instructable robot framework combining LLMs and visual models can succeed at complex instruction-following with zero-shot generalization, and the experiments aim to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel framework called \texttt{Instruct2Act} that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to map multi-modality instructions to sequential actions for robotic manipulation tasks. 2. The framework employs LLMs to generate Python programs that implement a full perception, planning and action loop for completing robotic tasks. It leverages the expertise of visual foundation models like SAM and CLIP through APIs, while generating policies using the LLM's ability for in-context learning.3. Demonstrating the flexibility of the framework in handling different instruction modalities like natural language, visual inputs, and pointing instructions. A unified retrieval architecture is presented to handle these varying inputs.4. Evaluating the framework on a range of robotic manipulation tasks and showing strong zero-shot performance that exceeds prior learning-based methods on several tasks. The approach also shows good generalization ability.5. Providing the full framework code to serve as a benchmark for robotic instruction following tasks with diverse modality inputs.In summary, the key contribution is presenting a novel framework for generating robotic policies from multifaceted instructions, while maintaining flexibility, leverage of foundation models, strong zero-shot ability and generalization. The code release also enables it to be a valuable benchmark for future research.
