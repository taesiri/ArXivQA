# [Multi-Modal Video Topic Segmentation with Dual-Contrastive Domain   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00220)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Video topic segmentation aims to divide a video into topically coherent segments. Prior work has focused on shot/scene segmentation which relies heavily on visual cues and works well for short videos with clear visual shifts between segments. However, these methods fail for long, livestream videos which have subtle visual changes but complex semantics. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a neural multi-modal video topic segmenter that utilizes both video transcripts and frames. It treats segmentation as a sequence labeling task and uses a cross-modal attention mechanism to effectively integrate text and visual signals. 

To adapt the model trained on short YouTube videos to longer, more complex videos, the paper proposes two strategies:
1) Sliding window inference to break a long video into short snippets as input 
2) Dual-contrastive learning objectives to bring text-visual pairs from the same segment closer and push non-related pairs further apart

Main Contributions:
1) A multi-modal neural video topic segmenter with cross-modal attention that outperforms baselines on a new large-scale YouTube corpus
2) A dual-contrastive domain adaptation approach to transfer the model trained on short videos to long, complex videos 
3) Experiments showing the model adapted with this strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on long videos from the BBC and Behance datasets, demonstrating improved generalization.

In summary, the paper presents an effective neural framework for multi-modal video topic segmentation and unsupervised adaptation methods that allow the model to transfer better to long, livestream videos. The dual learning objectives provide noticeable gains, enhancing the model's accuracy and robustness.
