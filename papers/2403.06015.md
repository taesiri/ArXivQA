# [Grafting: Making Random Forests Consistent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06015)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Random forests are a popular and widely used machine learning method, but little is known theoretically about their properties. In particular, it is unknown if random forests are universally consistent, meaning whether they converge to the true conditional expectation function as the sample size increases. 

- Prior work has shown consistency for random forests under strict assumptions like additive models or when using subsampling instead of bootstrapping. But it is still an open question if the original Breiman random forest algorithm is consistent.

- Random forests also have some limitations in practice - they struggle to capture smooth continuous patterns and high frequency patterns in the data. This is due to the piecewise constant nature of decision trees.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a variant of random forests called "Grafted Trees" where a shallow decision tree is first grown using the CART splitting criteria, and then a secondary consistent estimator like centered random forests is grafted onto each leaf node.

- Intuitively, the initial CART tree detects discontinuities and reduces variance, enabling the secondary estimator to converge quickly. And grafting forces a finer partition that can capture high frequency patterns.

Main Contributions:
- Proves that Grafted Trees are universally consistent under mild assumptions, unlike Breiman's original algorithm.

- Shows empirically that Grafted Trees can adapt inconsistent estimators like kernel regression to be consistent in high dimensions through feature selection in the initial CART step.

- Demonstrates superior performance to Breiman forests and centered forests on simulated data, especially for smooth, continuous functions.

- Provides guidance on tuning parameters - suggests shallow CART trees are preferred, and depth of initial CART tree should grow slowly with sample size.

In summary, Grafted Trees are a modification to random forests that have theoretical consistency guarantees and strong empirical performance in a diverse set of settings. The initial CART tree enables complex estimators to be used that can capture patterns difficult for standard random forests.
