# [Disentangling the Effects of Data Augmentation and Format Transform in   Self-Supervised Learning of Image Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn powerful visual representations from unlabeled images by enforcing consistency between different augmented views of the same image via a contrastive loss. The diversity and quality of augmentations applied during SSL pre-training plays a critical role in determining downstream performance. Most works use hand-designed augmentations like cropping, color jittering etc. directly in the image space. This paper hypothesizes that increasing augmentation diversity by transforming images to alternate domains can further improve downstream accuracy.  

Method:
This paper proposes Fourier Domain Augmentations (FDA) which involve applying stochastic augmentation directly in the frequency domain of images and inverting back to the image space. Four FDA techniques are introduced - amplitude rescaling, phase shifting, random frequency masking and Gaussian mixture masking in the Fourier spectrum. When inverted, these result in unique textures and artifacts which standard image augmentations cannot easily reproduce. 

The effect of FDA is studied by integrating it with standard image augmentations during the SSL pre-training of state-of-the-art methods like SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo v2 and SimSiam on ImageNet-1K. Downstream evaluation involves linear classification on ImageNet along with few-shot learning and transfer learning on other datasets.

Contributions:
- Proposes Fourier Domain Augmentations (FDA) and shows an average 1% gain across SSL methods on ImageNet linear probing when used together with standard image augmentations.
- Demonstrates improved few-shot and transfer learning performance with FDA during pre-training.
- Studies the disentangled effects of format transform vs augmentations by designing a two-encoder contrastive learning setup with separate image and frequency encoders. Shows that using format transforms alone during pre-training can improve accuracy even without any augmentations.
- Empirically shows that increasing augmentation diversity by using FDA leads to better downstream performance, confirming the paper's initial hypothesis.
- Opens up new research directions in effectively utilizing Fourier spectrum of images as an alternate modality for self-supervised representation learning.
