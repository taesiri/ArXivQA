# [GPU Cluster Scheduling for Network-Sensitive Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16492)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "GPU Cluster Scheduling for Network-Sensitive Deep Learning":

Problem:
- Deep learning (DL) workloads running on distributed GPU clusters suffer from high communication overhead, which increases training time and cost. 
- Communication overhead arises from exchanging gradients between GPUs during distributed training and depends on the network interconnects between the GPUs.
- Consolidating a DL job's GPUs onto physically close GPUs reduces communication overhead, but waiting for such consolidated GPUs increases queueing delays. 
- Different DL models have varying sensitivity to network conditions, so they do not all benefit equally from consolidation.
- Existing GPU cluster schedulers lack awareness of network topology, latest networking hardware capabilities, and each model's network sensitivity.

Proposed Solution:
- A new GPU cluster scheduler called Dally that employs "delay scheduling" to improve consolidation while managing queueing delays. 
- A network-sensitive preemption policy to prioritize resource offers to jobs that suffer more from poor network placements.
- An "auto-tuner" to dynamically optimize the delay timers used in scheduling based on cluster contention.
- A DL cluster simulator called Artist that integrates the Astra simulator to accurately model network overhead for evaluations.

Main Contributions:
- Dally scheduler with delay scheduling, network-sensitive preemption, and auto-tuning of delay timers.
- Artist cluster simulator that can dynamically determine network overhead for a DL job based on its assigned GPUs and underlying network hardware.
- Evaluations using real-world traces showing Dally improves makespan by 69%, reduces average job completion time by 83%, and slashes communication overhead by 98%.

In summary, the paper proposes a new DL cluster scheduling technique called Dally along with a simulation platform Artist to address limitations of existing schedulers. Dally leverages principles like delay scheduling and network sensitivity awareness to significantly improve efficiency and reduce cost. Extensive evaluations demonstrate major gains over state-of-the-art schedulers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Dally, a novel GPU cluster scheduler for distributed deep learning that enables proximity-based consolidation of GPU resources based on the jobs' sensitivities to anticipated communication-network delays in order to minimize end-to-end makespan, average job completion time, and communication overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel GPU cluster scheduler called Dally for distributed deep learning (DDL) workloads. The main contributions are:

1) Dally employs delay scheduling for job placement and consolidation to reduce end-to-end makespan, average job completion time (JCT), and communication overhead. It allows jobs to wait for resource offers with better consolidation up to certain delay timers.

2) It incorporates a network-sensitive preemption policy to prioritize giving consolidated resource offers to jobs that are more sensitive to network communication overhead.

3) It introduces an "auto-tuner" that dynamically adjusts the delay timer values based on historical job waiting times to optimize delay scheduling. 

4) The authors develop a DDL cluster simulation platform called Artificial Intelligence System Simulator (ARTISt) using ASTRA-sim that can accurately model network slowdowns for job placements and simulate clusters with modern networking hardware.

5) Evaluations using production workload traces show significant improvements in makespan, JCT, and communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art schedulers like Tiresias and Gandiva.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the Dally scheduler that leverages delay scheduling, network-sensitive preemption, and auto-tuning of timers to improve performance for DDL workloads. The ARTISt simulation platform also facilitates further research in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel network-sensitive priority metric Nw_sens to determine job priority for preemption. How is this metric calculated? What are the key components and how do they capture network sensitivity?

2. The paper employs delay scheduling for job placement. Explain the core concept behind delay scheduling and how it is adapted in this context for distributed deep learning workloads. What are the tradeoffs associated with this technique?

3. The paper introduces an auto-tuner module to dynamically adjust the delay timers used in delay scheduling. Walk through the details of how this auto-tuner functions. What metrics and historical data does it leverage to tune the timers? 

4. The high-fidelity simulator Artist is a key contribution enabling the evaluation of the proposed method. Elaborate on how Artist integrates Astra-sim to enable accurate modeling of network delays. What modifications were made to prior work Themis?

5. Discuss the process used to calibrate the simulator Artist to ensure accuracy. What real-world measurements were incorporated and how were the Astra configurations tuned?

6. The paper evaluates Dally under both batch and Poisson job arrival patterns. Analyze the tradeoffs associated with each pattern and how that impacts the performance of the different scheduling schemes.

7. The paper demonstrates up to 69% improvement in Makespan compared to prior consolidation-based techniques. Delve deeper into the factors driving this substantial improvement in light of the constraints and assumptions made.

8. The concept of "network sensitivity" plays a pivotal role in the decisions made by Dally. Elaborate further on how this sensitivity is defined and captured to enable sensitivity-aware consolidation. 

9. Queueing delays are significantly reduced under Dally compared to other schemes. Explain the mechanisms in Dally that contribute to minimizing queueing delays while still achieving high consolidation.

10. The paper indicates only a weak correlation between model skew and network sensitivity. Speculate on other potential factors that may govern a model's network sensitivity. What future work could be undertaken to better predict sensitivity?
