# [Robust Surgical Tool Tracking with Pixel-based Probabilities for   Projected Geometric Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04971)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Surgical automation relies on accurate localization of robotic manipulators in the camera frame. However, uncertainties in mechanical systems and camera calibration create errors that limit localization accuracy.
- Surgical robots often have partially visible kinematic chains visible in the camera frame making it hard to estimate the full set of parameters (camera-to-base transform, joint angles) for localization.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a lumped error parameterization that captures both the camera-to-base transform and joint angle errors. This enables localization of visible surgical robot links.
- Use the insertion shaft feature on surgical tools as an observation for estimating the lumped error. The insertion shaft can be modeled as a cylinder.
- Present a DNN-based insertion shaft line detection algorithm that is more robust than traditional edge detection approaches.
- Develop probabilistic observation models that fit detected pixels to the projected cylinder model for updating error estimates.

Contributions:
- Novel DNN-based insertion shaft detection that is robust in unstructured environments
- Multiple probabilistic observation models for incorporating shaft detections into Bayesian filtering
- Experimental comparison showing proposed approach reduces tracking error in structured and unstructured scenes
- Proposed methods enable more accurate surgical automation tasks by improving surgical tool localization

The key ideas are using the insertion shaft as a feature for localization, leveraging a DNN for robust detection, and fitting pixels to an analytic cylinder projection model to update state estimates in a probabilistic filtering framework. Comparative experiments demonstrate improved performance.
