# [End-to-end multilingual fact-checking at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12147)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spread of misinformation is a major global issue, made worse by lack of multilingual fact-checking tools. Most tools target English, leaving other languages disadvantaged. 
- Manual fact-checking by editors is time-consuming and not scalable.
- Existing automation extends only to grammar checkers and writing assistants, not fact-checking.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces Factiverse AI Editor (\system) - an innovative multilingual text editor capable of automatically identifying factual inaccuracies and suggesting corrections in over 100 languages.

Key Contributions:
- \system leverages cutting-edge AI models for end-to-end fact-checking within a text editor.
- It can identify check-worthy sentences that need verification.
- For these sentences, it searches multiple information sources for evidence and predicts a verdict on the claim's veracity.  
- If disputed, it also suggests corrections backed by evidence.
- Experiments show Factiverse models significantly outperform LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for claim detection and veracity prediction over 100+ languages.
- The system is easily accessible via a web interface.

In summary, the paper presents \system, an AI-powered multilingual text editor that performs automated end-to-end fact-checking to assist in combating the spread of misinformation globally. Both the problem and solution are timely and impactful.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper describes an AI-powered multilingual text editor called Factiverse AI Editor that can detect check-worthy claims in over 100 languages and verify their factuality using evidence from various sources, outperforming large language models like GPT-3.5 and Mistral-7b on claim detection and veracity prediction benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing and evaluating an end-to-end fact-checking system called Factiverse AI Editor that can detect check-worthy claims, search for evidence, predict claim veracity, and suggest corrections in over 100 languages. Specifically:

- They developed a web-based editor with AI models to assist in multilingual fact-checking by identifying factual inaccuracies and proposing corrections.

- They evaluated Factiverse AI models against GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and Mistral-7B on claim detection and veracity prediction tasks in over 100 languages, showing superior performance of Factiverse models in most languages. 

- They highlighted the capability of Factiverse models to outperform large language models adapted using prompt engineering for multilingual fact-checking tasks.

So in summary, the key contribution is the development and benchmarking of the Factiverse AI Editor system for end-to-end fact-checking across many languages.

The paper describes an end-to-end multilingual fact-checking system called Factiverse AI Editor that can detect check-worthy claims, search for evidence, and predict claim veracity in over 100 languages. It compares performance of Factiverse's fine-tuned Transformer models to LLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Mistral-7b on claim detection and veracity prediction using a Macro F1 evaluation metric. The key focus is on fact-checking performance in low-resource and multilingual settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using transformer models for claim detection. Can you elaborate on the specific architecture used? What modifications were made to the standard transformer model to adapt it for this task?

2. How exactly are the relevance scores calculated when picking evidence snippets from search results? What similarity metrics are used to match evidence snippets to the original claim?  

3. The paper evaluates models on translated evaluation sets. Could the translation process have introduced noise or errors that make the evaluation less reflective of real-world performance? How can this be accounted for?

4. When aggregating predictions from individual evidence snippets, what weighting schemes or ensemble techniques are used? Are certain sources considered more credible than others?

5. For the LLMs used, what specific prompt engineering strategies were utilized? How were the prompts tailored to improve performance on the fact checking tasks?

6. The Factiverse model seems to struggle on some European languages - why might this be the case? Is there something inherent about those languages that makes the tasks more difficult?

7. How exactly are corrections to disputed claims generated? Does the system provide multiple correction options or a single suggestion?

8. What quality assurance practices are utilized to ensure high precision and integrity of corrections suggested to users? How are bad or inaccurate suggestions avoided?

9. How is the system able to scale to supporting over 100 languages? What infrastructural or engineering solutions enable such broad language coverage?  

10. What future directions are planned for improving coverage of European languages identified as areas needing improvement? Will new training data be collected or other enhancements be made?
