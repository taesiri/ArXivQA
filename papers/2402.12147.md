# [End-to-end multilingual fact-checking at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12147)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spread of misinformation is a major global issue, made worse by lack of multilingual fact-checking tools. Most tools target English, leaving other languages disadvantaged. 
- Manual fact-checking by editors is time-consuming and not scalable.
- Existing automation extends only to grammar checkers and writing assistants, not fact-checking.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces Factiverse AI Editor (\system) - an innovative multilingual text editor capable of automatically identifying factual inaccuracies and suggesting corrections in over 100 languages.

Key Contributions:
- \system leverages cutting-edge AI models for end-to-end fact-checking within a text editor.
- It can identify check-worthy sentences that need verification.
- For these sentences, it searches multiple information sources for evidence and predicts a verdict on the claim's veracity.  
- If disputed, it also suggests corrections backed by evidence.
- Experiments show Factiverse models significantly outperform LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for claim detection and veracity prediction over 100+ languages.
- The system is easily accessible via a web interface.

In summary, the paper presents \system, an AI-powered multilingual text editor that performs automated end-to-end fact-checking to assist in combating the spread of misinformation globally. Both the problem and solution are timely and impactful.
