# [RetiGen: A Framework for Generalized Retinal Diagnosis Using Multi-View   Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models trained on one medical imaging domain often fail to generalize well to new target domains due to domain shift. This limits their practical deployment in real-world healthcare settings.
- Existing domain generalization methods rely only on single-view image data and cannot leverage multi-view images from target domain, even if available, to enhance adaptation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called RetiGen that utilizes unlabelled multi-view images from target domain to improve model's generalization capability. 

- RetiGen has 3 main components:
   1) Pseudo-label based Distribution Calibration (PDC): Addresses class imbalance by assigning pseudo-labels and undersampling target data.
   2) Test-time Self-Distillation with Regularization (TSD): Aligns model predictions on strongly augmented images with original image using pseudo-labels to refine decision boundaries. Employs memory queue for nearest neighbor search to refine pseudo-labels. 
   3) Multi-view Local Clustering and Ensembling (MVLCE): Enriches feature space using multi-view images. Aggregates predictions from multiple views of the same patient using soft voting.

- These components address various challenges of domain shift like class imbalance, noisy pseudo-labels, and limited single view perspective.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes new application area of utilizing unlabelled multi-view medical images for domain generalization.
- Proposes a novel 3-step framework RetiGen that leverages multi-view images to significantly enhance adaptation capability of models to new target domains.
- Achieves consistent and significant performance gains when integrated with multiple state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques.
- Demonstrates clear improvements compared to existing test-time adaptation methods.
- Can be deployed in online setting by relying solely on MVLCE component.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in advancing domain generalization for medical imaging by strategically exploiting the richness of multi-view data from target domain.
