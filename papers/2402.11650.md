# [Theoretical foundations for programmatic reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn optimal policies for agents acting in unknown environments. Typically policies are represented explicitly as mappings from states to actions, which does not scale well. 
- An emerging approach called "programmatic RL" represents policies as programs involving higher-order constructs like loops, making them more readable, interpretable and generalizable. 
- However, little is known theoretically about what makes a good class of programmatic policies, whether small optimal policies exist for environments, and how to learn such programmatic policies.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper defines a framework to study expressivity and succinctness of programmatic policy classes on environment classes.
- A simple programming language is used to define a class of gridworld environments with convex polygonal regions and linear transition predicates.
- A class of loop-based programmatic policies using subgoals is proposed. The size only depends on the number of regions, not full state space.
- Key theoretical results proven:
  - Expressivity: For any environment, an optimal policy exists in this policy class 
  - Succinctness: Upper bound on size independent of state space size
  - Algorithm to synthesize compact policies from paths 
- Experiments validate the framework on gridworld benchmarks.

Main Contributions:
- First theoretical formulation to study programmatic RL
- Novel environment class and policy class with loops/subgoals 
- Expressivity and succinctness results for policy class
- Efficient policy synthesis algorithm
- Implementation and empirical evaluation on gridworlds

This establishes an approach to design and analyze theoretically-grounded programmatic policy classes. Key directions identified for future work are studying performance/reward tradeoffs, verification of policies, generalizability, and developing learning algorithms for such programmatic policy classes.
