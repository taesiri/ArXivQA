## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the LaTeX code provided, it does not contain the full text of a research paper, but rather just the LaTeX formatting and document structure. The central research question or hypothesis cannot be determined from the LaTeX code alone. The LaTeX code sets up a main paper section and a supplementary materials section, includes various LaTeX packages for formatting, and defines some commands, but does not contain the core content of the paper that would describe the research goals and findings. To summarize the research question or hypothesis, the actual text contents of the "paper" and "supplementary" files would need to be provided. The LaTeX code structures the document but does not present the substantive content needed to ascertain the research goals of the paper.
