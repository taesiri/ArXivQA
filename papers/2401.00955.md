# [Learning Long Sequences in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) struggle to model long-range dependencies in sequences compared to Transformers. This is due to issues like vanishing gradients in RNNs and the challenge of training with non-differentiable spikes in SNNs.

- However, Transformers have high computational costs that scale quadratically with sequence length, making them unsuitable for deployment on low-power neuromorphic hardware. 

- Hence, there is a need for recurrent, neuro-inspired models that can capture long-range dependencies as effectively as Transformers but also be hardware friendly.

Solution:
- The paper proposes using state space models (SSMs) as the backbone for SNNs. SSMs are linear time-invariant systems that can model long sequences.

- Two SSM-based SNN architectures are presented - Binary S4D and Gated Spiking Unit (GSU).

- Binary S4D uses binary spiking activations for event-based computation. GSU mixes continuous SSM features using sparse ternary weights and ternarized SSM outputs using continuous weights.

Contributions:

- First demonstration of SSM-based SNNs outperforming Transformers on long-range sequence modeling tasks from the LRA benchmark.

- Binary S4D and GSU also outperform prior SNN methods on sequential MNIST using fewer parameters.

- Analysis showing non-differentiable spikes limit accuracy, but GSU with ternary weights matches SSM performance.

- Overall, the paper makes a case for bringing efficient SSM architectures to neuromorphic hardware via SNN implementations. The proposed Binary S4D and GSU aim to bridge this gap.

In summary, the key insight is leveraging the modeling capacities of SSMs to create hardware-friendly SNNs for better sequence learning than RNNs and Transformers. The GSU in particular stands out for matching SSM accuracy without dense computations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates state space model-based spiking neural networks for long sequence modeling, finding they can outperform Transformers while identifying challenges of binary spiking activations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) This study formulates SSM-based SNNs and tests SNNs for the first time on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, which contains much longer sequences than traditional neuromorphic benchmarks. It shows for the first time that SNNs can outperform Transformers on these established long-range sequence tasks. 

2) The paper demonstrates that SSNs built using SSMs can outperform current state-of-the-art SNNs on Sequential MNIST, while using fewer parameters. 

3) The paper provides evidence to suggest that the saturating behavior of spiking activations, not necessarily their discontinuity, can be considered the main challenge to scaling SNNs for long sequences and larger models. By introducing the Gated Spiking Unit (GSU), it is further highlighted how this problem can be avoided without using dense vector-matrix multiplications relying on multiplyâ€“accumulate (MAC) operations.

In summary, the main contributions are around formulating and evaluating SSM-based SNNs on long sequence tasks, showing they can outperform Transformers and other state-of-the-art SNNs, and identifying the key challenges (saturating activations) and potential solutions (GSU) to further improve SNN performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of Binary SSMs. How do they differ structurally from traditional SSM architectures like S4? What modifications were required to enable binary spiking activations?

2. The Gated Spiking Unit (GSU) is proposed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem imposed by binary activations. Explain the inspiration, formulation and training advantages of employing parallel pathways with ternary weights and ternarised features within the GSU.  

3. Surrogate gradient functions like fast sigmoid and arctangent are crucial for training SNNs. Analyze and compare the behaviour of these two functions. How may the choice of surrogate impact model performance and why?

4. The paper benchmarks Binary SSMs on the Long Range Arena (LRA) tasks for the first time. Elaborate on the significance of evaluating SNN architectures on the LRA compared to traditional neuromorphic benchmarks.

5. Binary SSMs manage to outperform Transformers on all LRA tasks, even on Path-X where accuracy degrades substantially relative to baselines. Discuss the implications of this result in assessing the viability of SSM-based SNNs.

6. On sequential MNIST, Binary SSMs surpass state-of-the-art SNN accuracy while using fewer parameters. Explain how the structured state space backbone enables improved performance over traditional spiking neurons.

7. The paper argues binary spikes may not be an inherent requirement for SNNs. Elaborate on the evidence presented, especially GSU results, to support this claim. What alternatives exist?

8. Analyze the experiments conducted using continuous saturating activations. What performance bounds do they highlight with regards to binary SSMs and surrogate gradient training?

9. The GSU allows propagating non-saturating signals to avoid vanishing gradients while retaining efficient operations. Propose other potential solutions one could explore instead of the GSU to achieve this.

10. The paper focuses on modelling accuracy. Discuss what considerations should be made regarding deploying Binary SSMs and GSU-based models to neuromorphic hardware in terms of energy efficiency.
