# [A Framework for Portrait Stylization with Skin-Tone Awareness and Nudity   Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Portrait stylization is challenging to transform an input image into a specific art style while preserving inherent characteristics. Recent models like Stable Diffusion have improved quality but lack ability to effectively filter harmful content and preserve distinct input features like skin tone.

- Two main challenges: 
1) Skin tone representation - models alter users' actual skin tones to match trained style, raising ethical concerns. 
2) Potential to generate sexualized content that undermines IP value.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose portrait stylization framework with two modules:
1) Skin-Tone-Aware Portrait Stylization Module (STAPSM) - Uses low-rank adaptation model fine-tuned on skin-tone augmented data and two-stage progressive inference to represent style in detail while preserving input skin tone.

2) Nudity Content Identification Module (NCIM) - Uses CLIP embedding classifier combined with BLIP caption-based keyword matching to identify harmful input content. Addresses biases in embedding classifier.

Main Contributions:
- STAPSM accurately represents diverse skin tones while expressing unique art style. Two-stage progressive inference preserves both skin tone and intricate input details.

- NCIM enhances filtering of explicit content over standalone classifiers, while allowing flexible management of filters to suit cultural norms.

- Framework deployed in practice for over 2 million stylized portraits. Validation of skin tone representation and nudity filtering ability to meet real-world requirements.
