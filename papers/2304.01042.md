# [DivClust: Controlling Diversity in Deep Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01042)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently produce multiple, diverse partitionings (clusterings) of a dataset using deep learning frameworks. The key points are:- Existing deep clustering methods focus on producing a single clustering solution. However, consensus/ensemble clustering using multiple diverse base clusterings can produce better and more robust results. - Generating diverse clusterings typically requires training models multiple times, which is computationally costly. - This paper proposes a method called DivClust to address this gap. DivClust can be incorporated into existing deep clustering frameworks to efficiently produce multiple clusterings with controlled diversity.- DivClust uses a diversity controlling loss function to restrict the similarity between pairs of clusterings produced by the model. This allows tuning the clusterings to have a desired degree of diversity.- Experiments show DivClust can effectively control diversity without reducing clustering quality. The diverse clusterings can be aggregated via consensus clustering to improve performance over single clustering baselines.In summary, the key research question is how to efficiently generate diverse clusterings with deep learning models, which DivClust addresses by controlling inter-clustering diversity via a novel loss function.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contribution appears to be a new method called DivClust that can be incorporated into existing deep clustering frameworks to learn multiple clusterings with controlled diversity. Specifically:- DivClust proposes a novel loss function that restricts inter-clustering similarity to be below a dynamically adjusted threshold. This allows controlling diversity according to a user-defined metric.- DivClust introduces minimal computational overhead compared to training a single deep clustering model, making it efficient. - Experiments on multiple datasets and frameworks show DivClust can effectively control diversity without reducing clustering quality. - When used with consensus clustering, the diverse clusterings learned by DivClust produce solutions superior to single clustering baselines and alternative ensemble methods.In summary, the key contributions seem to be: 1) An efficient way to control diversity in deep clustering 2) Demonstrating this improves performance of deep clustering via consensus clustering. The proposed DivClust method enables studying the impact of diversity and is broadly applicable across deep clustering frameworks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is how I see this paper comparing to other research in the field of deep clustering:- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a method called DivClust to control diversity in deep clustering ensembles. This allows generating multiple diverse clusterings efficiently using a single model. Other deep clustering methods have not explicitly focused on controlling diversity. - Most prior work on diverse clustering has been in traditional (non-deep) methods like k-means. Those cannot be easily adapted for deep clustering. The few deep clustering methods that generate multiple views like DiMVMC and ENRC use subspace clustering which does not directly control inter-clustering diversity.- For consensus clustering, most existing deep clustering methods rely on training multiple separate models. DivClust provides an efficient alternative by producing diverse clusterings from a single model with minimal overhead. - The loss function proposed in DivClust to control diversity appears novel and suited for deep clustering frameworks. The dynamic threshold adjustment method is also a useful contribution.- Experiments show DivClust can control diversity across datasets and frameworks. The consensus solutions it produces tend to outperform single clustering baselines. This demonstrates its robustness and potential to improve deep clustering outcomes.Overall, I believe this paper makes an important contribution by addressing the largely overlooked problem of diversity control in deep clustering. The proposed DivClust method appears to be a flexible and efficient solution with solid experimental results. This can open up new research directions at the intersection of deep clustering and ensemble methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing methods to determine the optimal level of diversity for clustering ensembles in different settings. The paper notes that identifying what degree of diversity leads to the best consensus clustering performance remains an open problem. The ability to control diversity with DivClust can facilitate this research.- Exploring the impact of diversity in deep clustering ensembles more thoroughly. The authors state that DivClust provides a new tool to study this problem.- Applying DivClust to additional deep clustering frameworks beyond the ones tested in the paper, to further demonstrate its adaptability.- Evaluating the performance of DivClust on larger-scale datasets. The paper focuses on smaller image datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet subsets. Testing on larger datasets could further validate its scalability.- Examining the use of different diversity metrics beyond NMI. The authors use average NMI between clusterings to measure diversity, but other metrics could also be applicable.- Investigating modifications to the loss function, such as enforcing diversity between each pair of clusterings rather than in aggregate. The paper suggests this as a straightforward extension.- Combining DivClust with improvements to consensus clustering algorithms. The paper notes DivClust could potentially be used jointly with methods that develop better consensus clustering techniques.In summary, some of the key future directions are studying the optimal levels of diversity, evaluating the impact of diversity in deep clustering ensembles, applying DivClust to more frameworks and datasets, exploring additional diversity metrics, modifying the loss function, and combining it with advancements in consensus clustering algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes DivClust, a method to control diversity in deep clustering frameworks. DivClust introduces an additional loss function that restricts the similarity between cluster assignment outputs from the model to be below a user-defined threshold. This encourages the model to learn multiple diverse clusterings simultaneously using a shared feature extractor and multiple projection heads. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs datasets demonstrate that DivClust can effectively control inter-clustering diversity across different frameworks like IIC, PICA, and CC. The diverse clusterings learned by DivClust lead to improved consensus clustering performance compared to single clustering baselines when using an off-the-shelf consensus method. A key advantage of DivClust is that it requires minimal additional computational cost beyond training a single clustering model. The paper demonstrates an effective way to control diversity in deep clustering to improve performance via consensus clustering.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes DivClust, a method for incorporating diversity control into deep clustering frameworks. Deep clustering has seen significant progress, but most methods focus on producing a single clustering solution. However, consensus clustering, which combines multiple diverse clustering solutions, often outperforms single clusterings. To enable consensus clustering in deep clustering, DivClust adds a complementary loss function to existing deep clustering models to control the diversity between multiple learned clusterings. Specifically, given a user-defined inter-clustering similarity target, DivClust restricts similarity between pairs of clusterings to be below a dynamically adjusted threshold. This is achieved by calculating a similarity matrix between cluster assignment vectors and penalizing values exceeding the threshold. Importantly, DivClust introduces minimal computational overhead to existing deep clustering frameworks. Experiments were conducted with various datasets and frameworks. Results demonstrate DivClust can effectively control diversity without reducing clustering quality. Further, with an off-the-shelf consensus method, the diverse DivClust clusterings produced solutions superior to single-clustering baselines, effectively improving their performance. DivClust provides a simple, efficient way to apply consensus clustering to deep clustering and study diversity's impact. The method's robustness across settings and minimal overhead make it an attractive tool for improving deep clustering frameworks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes DivClust, a method to control diversity in deep clustering frameworks. DivClust adds a novel loss function to existing deep clustering objectives that restricts the similarity between multiple clusterings learned by the model. Specifically, given a user-defined inter-clustering similarity target, DivClust dynamically estimates an upper bound on the similarity between cluster pairs. This is used in a loss that penalizes the model if the aggregate similarity between clusterings exceeds the bound, thereby promoting diversity. The method requires minimal changes to integrate into existing frameworks - just duplicating the projection heads. Experiments on various datasets and clustering methods demonstrate DivClust can effectively control diversity without sacrificing clustering quality. Further, consensus clustering on the diverse clusterings improves over single clustering baselines, highlighting the utility of DivClust.
