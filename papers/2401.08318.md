## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- With rising communication capacities, there is a growing need for enhanced digital pre-distortion (DPD) methods to correct non-linearities in wideband power amplifiers (PAs). However, there is a lack of open-source platforms for fast DPD exploration and objective comparison of DPD models.  

- Traditional DPD methods like general memory polynomial (GMP) struggle with increasingly wider signal bandwidths that introduce intricate non-linearity and memory effects in PAs.

- Deep learning has advanced DNN-based DPD but entails greater computational demand. Also, inconsistent experimental setups and methodologies make objective evaluation of DPD models difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents OpenDPD, an open-source end-to-end (E2E) learning framework in PyTorch for PA modeling and DPD. 

- It introduces a dataset from a digital PA (DPA) in a digital transmitter architecture along with simulated metrics like SIM-ACPR and SIM-EVM for consistent testing.

- A Dense Gated Recurrent Unit (DGRU) based DPD architecture is proposed that outperforms LSTM, GRU and prior works in correcting non-linearity of the DPA regarding measured ACPR and EVM.

Main Contributions:
- OpenDPD framework to streamline DPD exploration with standardized dataset and benchmarks for objective comparisons

- Introduction of an E2E learning architecture using backpropagation through a DNN-based PA model to train DPD without assumptions on PA commutability

- DGRU-DPD architecture that achieves state-of-the-art ACPR of -44.69/-44.47 dBc and EVM of -35.22 dB on 200 MHz OFDM signals  

- Extensible OpenDPD platform with plan to add more PA datasets and pre-trained models to benefit interdisciplinary DPD research
