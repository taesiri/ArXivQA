# [Towards providing reliable job completion time predictions using PCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10354)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper argues that providing reliable job completion time predictions should be a core primitive in today's cloud systems, similar to how real-world systems like transportation and e-commerce provide users with estimated timelines (e.g. package delivery date). However, analyzing existing GPU scheduling policies reveals a trade-off - policies optimized for performance/fairness use unbounded preemption, making them unpredictable, while non-preemptive policies like FIFO are predictable but impractical due to poor performance. The paper identifies a need for scheduling policies that can provide predictability while balancing performance and fairness.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents Predictability-Centric Scheduling (PCS), a novel scheduling framework that aims to provide reliable completion time estimates while being practical. PCS allows operators to specify objectives related to performance, fairness and predictability via a preference interface. To meet these objectives, PCS leverages Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) in a unique way along with a simulation-based strategy to find suitable WFQ configurations that lie on the Pareto front. WFQ provides predictability by using bounded preemption and flexibility by controlling aspects like number of classes, class weights and thresholds to optimize different objectives.

Contributions:
- Shows state-of-the-art scheduling policies are either extremely unpredictable (due to unbounded preemption) or impractical (due to no preemption)
- Proposes PCS, a scheduling framework that uses WFQ to provide predictability and flexibility to operators to balance multiple objectives
- Implements a prototype of PCS and evaluates it using DNN workloads on a GPU testbed and large-scale simulations
- Results show PCS can provide completion time estimates with low error while only marginally compromising performance/fairness compared to state-of-the-art schemes

The key insight is that by using WFQ in a novel way along with a simulation-guided strategy, PCS allows operators to make explicit trade-offs between predictability and other scheduling objectives. This is an important step towards making cloud scheduling predictable while remaining practical.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new scheduling framework called Predictability-Centric Scheduling that aims to provide reliable job completion time predictions to cloud users while balancing performance, fairness, and flexibility for cloud operators.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing PCS, a new scheduling framework that aims to provide predictability in job completion time estimates while balancing performance and fairness. Specifically:

- It shows that existing scheduling policies that optimize for performance and fairness can result in unpredictability in job completion times. 

- It presents the PCS framework that elevates predictability as an important scheduling objective, alongside performance and fairness. PCS allows cloud operators to choose desired tradeoffs between these objectives.

- It uses Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) in a novel way along with a simulation-based search strategy to find Pareto-optimal WFQ configurations that meet operator specified tradeoffs.

- It provides a bi-directional preference interface that allows operators to specify high level objectives and presents them with Pareto-optimal configuration tradeoffs to choose from. 

- It evaluates PCS for GPU scheduling of ML workloads, showing it can provide accurate job completion time predictions while marginally compromising on performance and fairness compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is the PCS scheduling framework that brings predictability as a first-class scheduling objective while retaining flexibility to balance performance and fairness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Predictability - Providing reliable job completion time predictions to cloud users. A core focus of the paper.

- Flexibility - Allowing cloud operators to choose different tradeoff points between predictability and other objectives like performance and fairness.

- Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) - Used as a building block for the Predictability Centric Scheduling (PCS) framework. Offers bounded preemption and tunable parameters.

- Pareto Optimality - Discovering WFQ configurations that represent different Pareto optimal tradeoff points between objectives. Enables informed decision making.

- Simulation-based Search - Used to efficiently explore the large space of possible WFQ configurations and find those on the Pareto frontier.

- Job Completion Time (JCT) - Traditional performance metric that is balanced against predictability.

- Unpredictability/Prediction Error - Captures the relative error between predicted and actual job completion times. Minimizing this is key.

- GPU Scheduling - A key use case used for evaluation, given the complexity and long running times of ML workloads.

So in summary, the core focus is achieving predictability in job completion times while retaining flexibility to balance other scheduling objectives, using concepts like WFQ and Pareto optimality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the paper define and quantify predictability for scheduling systems? What metrics are used to evaluate predictability?

2) Explain the key components and workflow of the proposed Predictability-Centric Scheduling (PCS) framework. What are the roles of the preference interface, preference solver, WFQ scheduler etc.?

3) Why is Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) chosen as the base scheduling algorithm in PCS? What properties of WFQ help provide predictability and flexibility?

4) What heuristics and optimizations does the preference solver use to efficiently search the large space of possible WFQ configurations? How does it parameterize and evaluate different configurations?

5) How does PCS handle sophisticated job demand functions and heterogeneous resources? What techniques does it leverage to deal with issues like sub-linear scaling? 

6) What are some examples of operator preferences that can be specified using the PCS interface? How does it support expressing tradeoffs between different objectives?

7) How is the prediction error metric defined? What are some sources of unpredictable behavior and error even when using WFQ?

8) Compare and contrast the predictability vs performance tradeoffs achieved by PCS to other scheduling schemes like SRSF, Max-Min fairness, and FIFO.

9) What simplifying assumptions does PCS make about the workload, jobs, and system? How can it be extended to relax these assumptions?

10) What are some practical deployment considerations and ideas for future work to improve upon PCS's approach of balancing predictability and other scheduling objectives?
