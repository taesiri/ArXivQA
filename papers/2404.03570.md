# [Embodied AI with Two Arms: Zero-shot Learning, Safety and Modularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03570)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emerging AI systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) raise new opportunities and challenges for robotics, especially around safety and reliability when deployed on physical robotic systems.

- Bi-arm robot manipulation skills are needed for robots to effectively operate in human environments, but require additional reasoning for coordination between arms. Executing instructions in natural language on a real bi-arm system poses additional challenges around planning feasibility, motion constraints, and human safety.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a modular bi-arm system architecture that connects an LLM task planner, VLM perception system, simulation-trained skills library, and constrained trajectory optimization and control modules.

- The system can take open-ended natural language instructions as input, leverage the LLM for high-level planning, use the VLM to perceive the environment, and coordinate the robot's arms to execute instructions through the skills library and control modules.

- The modular structure facilitates incorporating different modalities of safety into the system, enables explainability of failures, and allows individual components to be swapped out.

Key Contributions:

- Demonstration of an end-to-end pipeline from natural language instructions to physical bi-arm robot execution on real-world tasks.

- A modular architecture that connects state-of-the-art models in a transparent and interpretable way, facilitating safety and allowing in-place swapping of components.  

-Introduces simulations-trained skills and policies that enable zero-shot transfer of the system to the real robot without any real robot data.

- Analysis of performance on semantic bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks highlights capabilities for instruction following, coordination, and safety, as well as current limitations.
