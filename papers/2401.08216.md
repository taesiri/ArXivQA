# [Towards Efficient and Certified Recovery from Poisoning Attacks in   Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08216)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to poisoning attacks where malicious clients can manipulate their model updates to degrade the performance of the global model. Although methods exist to detect such malicious clients, by the time they are identified, the global model is already poisoned. Hence, there is a need for an efficient method to recover an accurate global model after detecting the attackers. Existing recovery methods rely on storing all historical information and rolling back to the initial unaffected model, which is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Crab, an efficient and certified recovery method that uses two key strategies:

1. Selective information storage: Instead of storing all historical information, Crab selectively stores only the most important updates from certain rounds and certain influential clients to minimize storage costs. 

2. Adaptive model rollback: Rather than reverting to the initial model, Crab rolls back to a recent model that is not too perturbed by attackers. This adaptive rollback to a good historical state accelerates recovery.  

Main Contributions:

1. Crab reduces storage and computing costs while achieving comparable recovery performance to retraining from scratch.

2. Theoretical analysis shows the model difference between Crab's recovered model and retrained model can be bounded.

3. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets and attacks demonstrate Crab's superior performance over previous approaches interms of accuracy, cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

4. Analysis of Crab's parameters provides insights on the tradeoff between resource consumption and recovery quality.

In summary, Crab enables efficient and certified global model recovery from poisoning attacks in federated learning through selective storage and adaptive rollback, outperforming existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Crab, an efficient and certified federated learning model recovery method from poisoning attacks, which relies on selective storage of essential historical information and adaptive rollback to a less poisoned global model rather than the initial one.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing Crab, an efficient and certified method for recovering the global model from poisoning attacks in federated learning. Crab relies on two key strategies - selective storage of essential historical information and adaptive rollback to a less affected historical model.

2. Proposing selective information storage and adaptive model rollback tailored for model recovery to reduce memory consumption and expedite the recovery speed.

3. Demonstrating theoretically that the difference between the global model recovered by Crab and the one recovered by train-from-scratch can be bounded under certain assumptions. 

4. Conducting extensive experiments across three datasets over multiple machine learning models and a variety of untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks. The experiments reveal that Crab is accurate, cost-effective and efficient in recovering the compromised global model.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and certified federated learning model recovery method called Crab, along with theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrating its effectiveness. The key ideas are selective storage and adaptive rollback for improved efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Federated learning (FL) - A distributed machine learning approach where models are trained locally on user devices and aggregated to construct a global model while keeping data decentralized. 

- Poisoning attacks - Attacks where malicious clients manipulate their model updates to degrade the performance of or inject backdoors into the global model.

- Model recovery - Methods to remove the effects of poisoning attacks on the global model after malicious clients are detected. 

- Selective storage - Storing only essential historical global models and gradients instead of all information to reduce storage costs.

- Adaptive rollback - Rolling back the global model to a suitable historical version that has not been significantly affected by attacks rather than always reverting to the initial model.

- Bounded model difference - Theoretical analysis proving the difference between the recovered model and training from scratch is limited.

- Evaluation metrics - Metrics like test accuracy, attack success rate, membership inference success rate used to evaluate recovery performance.

In summary, the key focus of the paper is providing an efficient and certified framework called Crab for recovering the global model in federated learning after detecting poisoning attacks, using strategies like selective storage and adaptive rollback.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using KL divergence for round selection during selective information storage. What are some alternative metrics that can be used for this purpose and what would be their advantages or disadvantages compared to KL divergence?

2. Client selection in the selective storage strategy relies on cosine similarity between client updates and the aggregated global update. Are there scenarios where this metric may not effectively capture client contribution? What modifications could make the selection more robust? 

3. The paper sets thresholds for loss reduction rate between time windows ($\alpha$) and influence rate ($\beta$) for adaptive rollback. How sensitive is the performance of the method to variations in these hyperparameters? What guidelines can be provided for tuning them?

4. Can you further explain the intuition behind using sensitivity analysis to identify the optimal rollback model? What are other ways this could be formulated as an optimization problem?

5. Theoretical analysis provides a bound on the difference between the Crab recovered model and train-from-scratch model. Can this bound be tightened further under additional assumptions?

6. How does the performance of Crab vary across different aggregation methods like FedAvg, FedProx, etc? Does it favor certain aggregation rules over others?

7. The paper focuses on image classification tasks. Would the selective storage and rollback strategies generalize effectively to other modalities like text, time-series data, etc.?

8. Can the ideas from Crab be integrated into existing defense methods that use techniques like sample filtering, noise addition, etc. to improve their efficiency?

9. The experiments primarily consider untargeted and backdoor attacks. How does Crab perform against other advanced attacks like model replacement, model inversion, etc? 

10. A limitation of Crab is the need to detect malicious clients before initiating recovery. How can the method be enhanced to remove this requirement and enable recovery even with undetected attackers?
