## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models be improved to better perform complex sequential reasoning tasks that require understanding context, maintaining state, inferring implicit knowledge, and utilizing memory? The authors hypothesize that by training large language models on multi-turn dialogues with carefully designed prompting strategies, the models can learn to carry out more sophisticated reasoning and exhibit some memory capabilities. Specifically, the paper introduces the Blender chatbot system which is built on a large pre-trained language model, Anthropic's Claude. Blender is trained on dialogues from the Blended Skill Talk (BST) dataset consisting of conversations that require skill blending - combining multiple skills like empathy, humor, knowledge lookup etc. in an integrated fashion. The key research questions/hypotheses explored are:- Can large language models acquire blended skills like empathy and humor through conversational training on diverse multi-turn dialogues?- Can prompting strategies like "tiered prompting" and providing conversation history help models effectively leverage context for coherent responses? - Can models exhibit memory over the course of a conversation via mechanisms like retrieving from context and referring back?- How do Blender chatbots powered by large language models compare to retrieval and baseline systems on conversational tasks requiring blended skills, contextual reasoning and memory?So in summary, the central goal is probing how large language models can be adapted for complex conversational AI through multi-turn dialogue training and tailored prompting strategies. The key hypothesis is that this approach can significantly enhance sequential reasoning, coherence and memory capabilities.Please let me know if I have accurately captured the core research question and hypothesis or if you need any clarification! I'm happy to discuss the paper further.
