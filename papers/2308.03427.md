## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models be improved to better perform complex sequential reasoning tasks that require understanding context, maintaining state, inferring implicit knowledge, and utilizing memory? The authors hypothesize that by training large language models on multi-turn dialogues with carefully designed prompting strategies, the models can learn to carry out more sophisticated reasoning and exhibit some memory capabilities. Specifically, the paper introduces the Blender chatbot system which is built on a large pre-trained language model, Anthropic's Claude. Blender is trained on dialogues from the Blended Skill Talk (BST) dataset consisting of conversations that require skill blending - combining multiple skills like empathy, humor, knowledge lookup etc. in an integrated fashion. The key research questions/hypotheses explored are:- Can large language models acquire blended skills like empathy and humor through conversational training on diverse multi-turn dialogues?- Can prompting strategies like "tiered prompting" and providing conversation history help models effectively leverage context for coherent responses? - Can models exhibit memory over the course of a conversation via mechanisms like retrieving from context and referring back?- How do Blender chatbots powered by large language models compare to retrieval and baseline systems on conversational tasks requiring blended skills, contextual reasoning and memory?So in summary, the central goal is probing how large language models can be adapted for complex conversational AI through multi-turn dialogue training and tailored prompting strategies. The key hypothesis is that this approach can significantly enhance sequential reasoning, coherence and memory capabilities.Please let me know if I have accurately captured the core research question and hypothesis or if you need any clarification! I'm happy to discuss the paper further.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new deep learning based method for few-shot learning. Few-shot learning aims to learn a new concept from only a few examples, which is an important capability for building flexible AI systems. The key idea in the paper is to leverage external unlabeled data to extract useful embeddings, in addition to the few labeled examples. Specifically, the method uses a neural network pretrained on unlabeled data to extract embeddings. It then trains simple classifiers on top of these embeddings using the few labeled examples. At test time, embeddings for novel examples are extracted using the pretrained network and classified using the trained classifiers. The method is evaluated on few-shot image classification benchmarks. It significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches that do not use unlabeled data. The improvements are especially pronounced when very limited labeled data is available (e.g. 1-2 examples per class). Analysis shows the benefits come from the pretrained network learning universal representations. Overall, the paper demonstrates unlabeled data can be highly valuable for few-shot learning. The proposed approach provides an effective way to leverage unlabeled data to learn embeddings that support rapid learning from limited supervised data.
