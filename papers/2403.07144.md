# [Thought Graph: Generating Thought Process for Biological Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07144)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Analyzing groups of genes to identify underlying biological processes is challenging due to weak individual gene signals and a lack of convergence on coherent biological themes. This is compounded by discrepancies in human annotations by different research groups.

Proposed Solution - Thought Graph:  
- Adopts a Tree-of-Thought architecture for guided expansion of relevant biological processes using large language models (LLMs), balancing coverage and specificity.
- A voting LLM supervises the expansion process to mitigate potential annotation discrepancies. 
- Incorporates domain knowledge from the Gene Ontology database to establish semantic relationships like "is-a" and "part-of" between processes.

Key Contributions:
1) Proposes Thought Graph to generate diverse yet precise biological processes to account for annotation discrepancies.
2) Builds rich edge semantics between processes by integrating external knowledge bases like Gene Ontology.  
3) Achieves significant improvements over GSEA (40.28% higher cosine similarity) and LLM baselines (5.38% higher) in recommending accurate biological processes for gene sets. 
4) Identifies an optimal depth of reasoning balancing specificity and accuracy.

In summary, Thought Graph advances gene set analysis through guided reasoning over biological processes augmented with domain knowledge to mitigate issues with human annotation discrepancies. It demonstrates superior performance over existing methods.
