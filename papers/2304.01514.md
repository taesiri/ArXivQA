# [Robust Outlier Rejection for 3D Registration with Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01514)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: How to develop a robust outlier rejection method for 3D registration that can handle scenarios with high outlier ratios where spatial consistency constraints may become ambiguous. The key ideas/contributions seem to be:1) Proposing a variational non-local network to learn discriminative correspondence features. This captures ambiguity in long-range dependencies via injected random features and uses variational Bayesian inference to model uncertainties. 2) Customizing a probabilistic graphical model over the network to enable effective variational inference and derive an optimization objective.3) Introducing a voting-based deterministic inlier searching mechanism that is theoretically shown to be more robust than RANSAC random sampling.4) Overall, developing a registration framework that uses probabilistic modeling and Bayesian learning to handle ambiguities in challenging cases like low overlap or repetitive structures. Evaluations on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch and KITTI datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.In summary, the main hypothesis is that explicitly modeling ambiguity and uncertainty can lead to more robust outlier rejection and 3D registration compared to prior spatial consistency-based methods like PointDSC. The key ideas are using variational Bayesian learning and deterministic inlier search.
