# [Efficient Discrete Physics-informed Neural Networks for Addressing   Evolutionary Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. However, they face challenges when solving evolutionary PDEs, especially for dynamical systems with multi-scale or turbulent solutions over time.  
- The reason is that standard PINNs may violate temporal causality, meaning the network is not sufficiently trained at earlier times before approximating solutions at later times. This causes training difficulties and inaccurate solutions.

Proposed Solution:
- Use implicit time differencing schemes like Crank-Nicolson to enforce temporal causality, propagating solutions from earlier to later times.
- Transfer learning to initialize the PINN at each time frame with the trained PINN from the prior frame. This accelerates training since only a small update is needed between adjacent frames.
- The proposed transfer learning enhanced discrete physics-informed neural network (TL-DPINN) method trains a sequence of PINNs, one for each time frame, transferring knowledge between them.

Main Contributions:
- Proves theoretically that the TL-DPINN method will converge if the time step is small and each PINN is well-trained per time frame.
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among PINN methods for solving evolutionary PDEs like reaction-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations.
- Improves computational efficiency by a factor of 4-40x compared to prior causal PINN formulations.
- Demonstrates the capability of discrete PINNs with low-order time stepping and transfer learning to accurately and robustly solve challenging evolutionary PDEs.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient technique to enhance PINNs for evolutionary equations using discrete-time models and transfer learning, with solid theoretical analysis and state-of-the-art numerical results.
