# [Efficient Discrete Physics-informed Neural Networks for Addressing   Evolutionary Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. However, they face challenges when solving evolutionary PDEs, especially for dynamical systems with multi-scale or turbulent solutions over time.  
- The reason is that standard PINNs may violate temporal causality, meaning the network is not sufficiently trained at earlier times before approximating solutions at later times. This causes training difficulties and inaccurate solutions.

Proposed Solution:
- Use implicit time differencing schemes like Crank-Nicolson to enforce temporal causality, propagating solutions from earlier to later times.
- Transfer learning to initialize the PINN at each time frame with the trained PINN from the prior frame. This accelerates training since only a small update is needed between adjacent frames.
- The proposed transfer learning enhanced discrete physics-informed neural network (TL-DPINN) method trains a sequence of PINNs, one for each time frame, transferring knowledge between them.

Main Contributions:
- Proves theoretically that the TL-DPINN method will converge if the time step is small and each PINN is well-trained per time frame.
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among PINN methods for solving evolutionary PDEs like reaction-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations.
- Improves computational efficiency by a factor of 4-40x compared to prior causal PINN formulations.
- Demonstrates the capability of discrete PINNs with low-order time stepping and transfer learning to accurately and robustly solve challenging evolutionary PDEs.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient technique to enhance PINNs for evolutionary equations using discrete-time models and transfer learning, with solid theoretical analysis and state-of-the-art numerical results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient method to solve evolutionary partial differential equations using transfer learning enhanced discrete physics-informed neural networks which sequentially update neural networks in time while retaining accuracy and computational efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Implicit time differencing with transfer-learning tuned physics-informed neural networks (PINN) provides more accurate and robust predictions of solutions to evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs), while retaining computational efficiency.

2. The paper proves an error estimation result for the proposed transfer learning enhanced discrete PINN (TL-DPINN) method, showing that the TL-DPINN solutions converge as long as the time step is small and each PINN in different time frames is well trained. 

3. Through extensive numerical experiments on benchmark problems like reaction-diffusion equations, Allen-Cahn equations, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations and Navier-Stokes equations, the paper demonstrates that the proposed TL-DPINN method attains state-of-the-art performance among various PINN frameworks in terms of balancing accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it improves accuracy of PINN approximations for evolutionary PDEs and also improves efficiency by a factor of 4-40 times compared to prior methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a new TL-DPINN method that enables more accurate and efficient solution of evolutionary PDEs using deep learning, with both theoretical and empirical evidence provided in the paper.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) - Neural networks that are trained on both data and physics-based loss functions to solve partial differential equations.

- Evolutionary partial differential equations - PDEs that evolve over time, such as the Navier-Stokes equations.

- Temporal causality - The principle that a model should be sufficiently trained at time t before approximating the solution at a later time t+Î”t. 

- Discrete-time PINNs - Using numerical time-stepping schemes like Crank-Nicolson to enforce temporal causality in PINN training.

- Transfer learning - Initializing a PINN at the next timestep with the trained parameters from the previous timestep to accelerate training. 

- Implicit time differencing schemes - Numerical methods like backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson that are unconditionally stable, allowing for larger timestep sizes.

- Convergence - Theoretical proof showing the PINN solutions converge as long as the timestep is small and each PINN is well-trained.

- Efficiency - Showing 4-40x speedups compared to prior PINN methods through accuracy and timing comparisons on benchmark problems.

So in summary, the key ideas are using discrete-time PINNs with transfer learning for efficient and stable training on time-dependent PDEs.
