# [Bi3D: Bi-domain Active Learning for Cross-domain 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05886)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to effectively perform cross-domain 3D object detection with high performance but low annotation cost. 

Specifically, the authors propose a new approach called Bi3D (Bi-domain Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) that actively selects informative samples from both source and target domains to adapt a 3D object detector trained on the source domain to a new target domain using minimal annotation budget. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Selecting target-like samples from the source domain can help reduce the domain gap and improve adaptation performance. 

2) Actively selecting diverse and representative samples from the target domain using a proposed similarity-based sampling strategy can further improve model adaptation with minimal annotations.

3) Combining both source and target domain active sampling strategies together in Bi3D can achieve better cross-domain detection performance than state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods, with only 1-5% annotation budget on the target domain.

So in summary, the central research question is how to achieve effective cross-domain 3D detection with low annotation cost, which is addressed through the proposed Bi3D method and associated source and target active sampling strategies. The key hypothesis is that smart bi-domain active sampling can outperform UDA given very limited target labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a novel Bi3D framework that utilizes active learning to achieve effective 3D scene-level cross-domain object detection. This is the first work to explore active domain adaptation for 3D object detection.

2. It develops a Bi-domain active sampling approach, consisting of a domainness-aware source sampling strategy and a diversity-based target sampling strategy. The source sampling strategy selects target-domain-like data from the source domain. The target sampling strategy selects the most diverse and representative data from the target domain. 

3. Extensive experiments show that Bi3D outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods with only 1% target annotation budget on various cross-domain 3DOD tasks. It achieves 89.63% AP_BEV on nuScenes->KITTI adaptation, even surpassing the fully supervised oracle result on KITTI.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel Bi-domain active learning approach to minimize the annotation cost while achieving effective domain adaptation for 3D object detection. The Bi3D framework and the associated sampling strategies are tailored for the 3D point cloud data to select the most useful source and target samples for adaptation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Bi-domain active learning framework called Bi3D for cross-domain 3D object detection, which selects informative samples from both source and target domains to adapt a detector trained on the source domain to a new target domain using minimal annotation budget.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D object detection:

- This paper proposes a novel bi-domain active learning (Bi3D) approach for cross-domain 3D object detection. It differs from prior work in domain adaptation for 3D detection which has focused primarily on unsupervised methods. 

- Existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods like ST3D and LiDAR Distillation have shown performance improvements when transferring a model from a source dataset to a target dataset. However, as discussed in the introduction, there is still a sizable gap compared to training with full supervision on the target dataset. 

- The key innovation of this paper is actively sampling a small subset of informative source and target data for annotation rather than relying entirely on unlabeled data. This allows reaching higher accuracy on the target domain while minimizing the human labeling effort.

- For source sampling, they select target-domain-like examples based on a "domainness" score. For target sampling, they propose a diversity-based strategy to pick diverse and representative examples. 

- In experiments, their approach outperforms prior UDA methods by a large margin across multiple domain shifts like cross-country, cross-sensor, etc. using only 1% target labels. The gains over UDA methods demonstrate the power of active sampling.

- Their model trained on 5% KITTI data even exceeds the fully supervised Oracle baseline trained on 100% KITTI data. This shows the effectiveness of their bi-domain sampling to achieve high accuracy with minimal annotation cost.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of cross-domain 3D detection by showing for the first time how active domain adaptation can surpass limits of unsupervised methods. The bi-domain sampling approach efficiently bridges the source and target domains.
