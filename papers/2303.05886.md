# [Bi3D: Bi-domain Active Learning for Cross-domain 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05886)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to effectively perform cross-domain 3D object detection with high performance but low annotation cost. 

Specifically, the authors propose a new approach called Bi3D (Bi-domain Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) that actively selects informative samples from both source and target domains to adapt a 3D object detector trained on the source domain to a new target domain using minimal annotation budget. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Selecting target-like samples from the source domain can help reduce the domain gap and improve adaptation performance. 

2) Actively selecting diverse and representative samples from the target domain using a proposed similarity-based sampling strategy can further improve model adaptation with minimal annotations.

3) Combining both source and target domain active sampling strategies together in Bi3D can achieve better cross-domain detection performance than state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods, with only 1-5% annotation budget on the target domain.

So in summary, the central research question is how to achieve effective cross-domain 3D detection with low annotation cost, which is addressed through the proposed Bi3D method and associated source and target active sampling strategies. The key hypothesis is that smart bi-domain active sampling can outperform UDA given very limited target labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a novel Bi3D framework that utilizes active learning to achieve effective 3D scene-level cross-domain object detection. This is the first work to explore active domain adaptation for 3D object detection.

2. It develops a Bi-domain active sampling approach, consisting of a domainness-aware source sampling strategy and a diversity-based target sampling strategy. The source sampling strategy selects target-domain-like data from the source domain. The target sampling strategy selects the most diverse and representative data from the target domain. 

3. Extensive experiments show that Bi3D outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods with only 1% target annotation budget on various cross-domain 3DOD tasks. It achieves 89.63% AP_BEV on nuScenes->KITTI adaptation, even surpassing the fully supervised oracle result on KITTI.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel Bi-domain active learning approach to minimize the annotation cost while achieving effective domain adaptation for 3D object detection. The Bi3D framework and the associated sampling strategies are tailored for the 3D point cloud data to select the most useful source and target samples for adaptation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Bi-domain active learning framework called Bi3D for cross-domain 3D object detection, which selects informative samples from both source and target domains to adapt a detector trained on the source domain to a new target domain using minimal annotation budget.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D object detection:

- This paper proposes a novel bi-domain active learning (Bi3D) approach for cross-domain 3D object detection. It differs from prior work in domain adaptation for 3D detection which has focused primarily on unsupervised methods. 

- Existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods like ST3D and LiDAR Distillation have shown performance improvements when transferring a model from a source dataset to a target dataset. However, as discussed in the introduction, there is still a sizable gap compared to training with full supervision on the target dataset. 

- The key innovation of this paper is actively sampling a small subset of informative source and target data for annotation rather than relying entirely on unlabeled data. This allows reaching higher accuracy on the target domain while minimizing the human labeling effort.

- For source sampling, they select target-domain-like examples based on a "domainness" score. For target sampling, they propose a diversity-based strategy to pick diverse and representative examples. 

- In experiments, their approach outperforms prior UDA methods by a large margin across multiple domain shifts like cross-country, cross-sensor, etc. using only 1% target labels. The gains over UDA methods demonstrate the power of active sampling.

- Their model trained on 5% KITTI data even exceeds the fully supervised Oracle baseline trained on 100% KITTI data. This shows the effectiveness of their bi-domain sampling to achieve high accuracy with minimal annotation cost.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of cross-domain 3D detection by showing for the first time how active domain adaptation can surpass limits of unsupervised methods. The bi-domain sampling approach efficiently bridges the source and target domains.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extending the Bi3D framework to other 3D tasks beyond object detection, such as 3D semantic segmentation or 3D instance segmentation. The authors suggest that active domain adaptation could be beneficial for other sparse 3D tasks as well.

- Exploring different active learning strategies beyond the proposed domainness-aware source sampling and diversity-based target sampling strategies. The authors mention that designing more advanced sampling criteria tailored for 3D data could further improve performance.

- Applying Bi3D to other types of 3D sensors beyond LiDAR, such as depth cameras or radar. The authors suggest that active domain adaptation could help transfer knowledge across different 3D sensing modalities.

- Evaluating Bi3D on more diverse domain shifts, such as weather and illumination changes. The authors currently focus on cross-dataset shifts but suggest exploring within-dataset domain gaps.

- Combining Bi3D with other unsupervised domain adaptation methods in a multi-task learning framework. The authors show initial results combining their method with self-training, but more advanced joint training schemes could be investigated.

- Extending Bi3D to the few-shot setting with extremely small annotation budgets. The authors use budgets of 1-5% but suggest exploring the limits of active domain adaptation with less labeled data.

In summary, the main directions are applying Bi3D to more 3D tasks and data types, designing better active sampling strategies, evaluating on more domain shifts, integrating with UDA methods, and reducing the annotation requirements. The core idea is to further explore active domain adaptation for 3D vision problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a bi-domain active learning approach called Bi3D for cross-domain 3D object detection. The goal is to achieve effective domain adaptation from a labeled source dataset to an unlabeled target dataset using only a small amount of annotated target data. The Bi3D method consists of a domainness-aware source sampling strategy and a diversity-based target sampling strategy. The source sampling strategy selects target-domain-like samples from the source domain to avoid negative transfer. The target sampling strategy selects diverse and representative data from the target domain for more effective adaptation. Experiments on cross-LiDAR-beam, cross-country, and cross-sensor scenarios show Bi3D outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods using only 1% annotated target data. Bi3D even surpasses a fully supervised model trained on the full target dataset, demonstrating the ability to achieve high performance with low annotation cost. Key innovations include the bi-domain sampling approach and designing strategies specifically for challenges of sparse 3D point cloud data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Bi3D for cross-domain 3D object detection. The goal is to adapt a 3D object detector trained on a source domain to a new target domain using only a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. The key innovation is a bi-domain active learning approach that selects informative samples from both the source and target domains. 

First, a domainness-aware source sampling strategy identifies target-domain-like samples in the source data and fine-tunes the detector on those samples. This aligns the source data distribution closer to the target. Next, a diversity-based target sampling strategy selects diverse and representative target samples by maintaining a similarity bank and clustering target data. The selected source and target samples are manually annotated and used to further adapt the detector to the target domain. Experiments on multiple domain shifts like cross-country and cross-sensor show Bi3D outperforms prior unsupervised domain adaptation methods using only 1% labeled target data. For nuScenes to KITTI, it even exceeds fully supervised training on 100% KITTI data.

In summary, this paper presents a novel bi-domain active learning approach for cross-domain 3D detection that achieves impressive performance using minimal target labeling. The core ideas are aligning the source data distribution to the target and actively sampling diverse target data to efficiently adapt the detector.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Bi-domain active learning (Bi3D) framework for 3D cross-domain object detection. Bi3D consists of two main components: 1) A domainness-aware source sampling strategy that selects target-domain-like samples from the source domain to avoid negative transfer. This is done by training a foreground region-aware discriminator to measure the domainness score of each source sample. Source samples with high domainness are selected. 2) A diversity-based target sampling strategy that selects the most informative and diverse subset from the target domain. It maintains a similarity bank of candidate target samples and clusters them based on feature similarity. The samples closest to the cluster centers are selected to ensure diversity. The selected source and target samples are then used to adapt a 3D detector pretrained on the source domain to the target domain. This allows effective domain adaptation with minimal target annotation cost.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Bi3D, a bi-domain active learning framework for cross-domain 3D object detection. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods for 3D detection still have a significant performance gap compared to models trained on fully annotated target data. To address this, Bi3D explores using active learning to select a small subset of important target data to annotate, enabling effective adaptation at low cost. The key ideas are: 1) A domainness-aware source sampling strategy identifies target-domain-like source data to avoid negative transfer and enhance adaptation. 2) A diversity-based target sampling method selects diverse and representative target frames using a similarity bank. Experiments on cross-domain scenarios like Waymo-to-KITTI show Bi3D outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods with only 1% target annotation budget. For example, on KITTI it achieves 89.63% AP compared to 84.29% for a UDA method, and even surpasses a supervised oracle trained on all KITTI data fully labeled (88.98% AP). The bi-domain active learning approach provides a new perspective on performing effective and low-cost cross-domain detection.
