# [Bi3D: Bi-domain Active Learning for Cross-domain 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05886)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to effectively perform cross-domain 3D object detection with high performance but low annotation cost. 

Specifically, the authors propose a new approach called Bi3D (Bi-domain Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) that actively selects informative samples from both source and target domains to adapt a 3D object detector trained on the source domain to a new target domain using minimal annotation budget. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Selecting target-like samples from the source domain can help reduce the domain gap and improve adaptation performance. 

2) Actively selecting diverse and representative samples from the target domain using a proposed similarity-based sampling strategy can further improve model adaptation with minimal annotations.

3) Combining both source and target domain active sampling strategies together in Bi3D can achieve better cross-domain detection performance than state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods, with only 1-5% annotation budget on the target domain.

So in summary, the central research question is how to achieve effective cross-domain 3D detection with low annotation cost, which is addressed through the proposed Bi3D method and associated source and target active sampling strategies. The key hypothesis is that smart bi-domain active sampling can outperform UDA given very limited target labels.
