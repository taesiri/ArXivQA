# [Bi3D: Bi-domain Active Learning for Cross-domain 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05886)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to effectively perform cross-domain 3D object detection with high performance but low annotation cost. 

Specifically, the authors propose a new approach called Bi3D (Bi-domain Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) that actively selects informative samples from both source and target domains to adapt a 3D object detector trained on the source domain to a new target domain using minimal annotation budget. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Selecting target-like samples from the source domain can help reduce the domain gap and improve adaptation performance. 

2) Actively selecting diverse and representative samples from the target domain using a proposed similarity-based sampling strategy can further improve model adaptation with minimal annotations.

3) Combining both source and target domain active sampling strategies together in Bi3D can achieve better cross-domain detection performance than state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods, with only 1-5% annotation budget on the target domain.

So in summary, the central research question is how to achieve effective cross-domain 3D detection with low annotation cost, which is addressed through the proposed Bi3D method and associated source and target active sampling strategies. The key hypothesis is that smart bi-domain active sampling can outperform UDA given very limited target labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a novel Bi3D framework that utilizes active learning to achieve effective 3D scene-level cross-domain object detection. This is the first work to explore active domain adaptation for 3D object detection.

2. It develops a Bi-domain active sampling approach, consisting of a domainness-aware source sampling strategy and a diversity-based target sampling strategy. The source sampling strategy selects target-domain-like data from the source domain. The target sampling strategy selects the most diverse and representative data from the target domain. 

3. Extensive experiments show that Bi3D outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods with only 1% target annotation budget on various cross-domain 3DOD tasks. It achieves 89.63% AP_BEV on nuScenes->KITTI adaptation, even surpassing the fully supervised oracle result on KITTI.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel Bi-domain active learning approach to minimize the annotation cost while achieving effective domain adaptation for 3D object detection. The Bi3D framework and the associated sampling strategies are tailored for the 3D point cloud data to select the most useful source and target samples for adaptation.
