# [Acquiring Linguistic Knowledge from Multimodal Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17936)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) require much more training data than humans to acquire language proficiency. For example, humans can learn language from less than 100 million words, whereas LMs need 10-100 billion words of text. This is known as the "data efficiency gap".

- The authors hypothesize that the lack of multimodal sensory input, such as vision, could partly explain this gap. Prior work on multimodal LMs has found mixed or negative results on improving language performance when adding vision, perhaps due to catastrophic forgetting or other technical issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- Train multimodal LMs while varying the text data volume (10M or 100M words) and image data volume (0, 40K, 400K or 4M images) independently. Use the FLAVA architecture and WiT dataset.

- Aim to prevent catastrophic forgetting of language through multitask learning on language-only objectives like masked language modeling, plus cross-modal objectives.

Main Contributions:

1. Developed codebase for training large multimodal LMs with varying text and vision.  

2. Evaluated effects of visual input on linguistic performance of text encoder in controlled setting.

3. Investigated potential mechanisms for how multimodal input could affect language learning in models.

Key Results:

- Adding visual input does not harm language performance but also does not provide clear consistent benefits. 

- There are occasional small improvements on grammar benchmarks with lower text data volume (10M) when adding images.

- No strong evidence that improvements are from grounding or cross-situational learning.

Limitations:
- Only one run per input configuration due to compute constraints, reducing robustness.

Conclusions:
- Current methods do not enable multimodal models to benefit from richer sensory signals for language acquisition. Architectures and techniques need further development to support hypothesis that multimodality helps explain data efficiency gap between LMs and humans.
