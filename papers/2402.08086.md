# [Text-centric Alignment for Multi-Modality Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Text-centric Alignment for Multi-Modality Learning":

Problem:
- Multimodal learning models often rely on fixed modalities during both training and inference. This limits their ability to handle unpredictable changes or absence of modalities at test time. 
- Traditional methods using embeddings from upstream foundation models for each modality fail to adapt when modalities change.
- Goal is to develop a model invariant across modalities that can train on certain modalities but perform zero-shot prediction on unseen modalities.

Proposed Solution - Text-centric Alignment for Multi-Modality Learning (TAMML):
- Leverages text as a unified semantic space using Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning.
- Transforms all modalities (image, text, tabular) into text representations.
- Further translates text styles across modalities to reduce gaps.  
- Summarizes text from different modalities to align distributions.
- Augments data with LLM reasoning to enhance predictions.
- Trains transformer model end-to-end on concatenated text.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes using LLMs and text representation for multimodal learning flexibility.
- TAMML significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predicting unseen modalities.
- Ablation studies validate effectiveness of each TAMML component.  
- TAMML maintains strong performance even when test modalities were seen during training.
- Analysis shows text representation more robust than embeddings for cross-modality translation.

In summary, this paper pioneers a novel approach to multimodal learning that can generalize to unpredictable modalities at test time. By unifying modalities through text and LLMs, TAMML provides an adaptable solution to limitations of traditional fixed-modality systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a text-centric multimodal learning approach called TAMML that leverages large language models and in-context learning to align representations across modalities, enabling robust performance even when modalities differ between training and inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. The paper investigates the potential advantage of using large language models (LLMs) and text representation for multimodal learning. It proposes TAMML, an in-context cross-modality translation method that utilizes foundation models to tackle training/testing modality mismatch and generalize to any unseen modality at test time.

2. The paper demonstrates through experiments on real-world datasets that TAMML can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches for handling unseen and diverse modality combinations. It also shows TAMML maintains robust performance even when the testing modality has been seen during training.  

3. Additional experiments and analyses provide evidence that using text as a representation is generally more robust for cross-modality translation compared to solutions relying on embedding representations. The visualization and distribution distance measurements also support the effectiveness of TAMML in aligning different modalities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a novel method called TAMML that leverages large language models and text representation to achieve flexible and effective multimodal learning that can generalize to unseen modalities at test time. The method outperforms existing solutions and establishes the potential of using text as a unified representation for bridging across modalities.
