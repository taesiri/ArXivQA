# [Pretraining Codomain Attention Neural Operators for Solving Multiphysics   PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Solving complex multiphysics PDEs with traditional numerical methods is computationally challenging as it requires discretizing on very fine grids to capture important physics accurately. 
- Existing neural operator architectures have limitations in solving multiphysics PDEs with complex geometries, interactions between physical variables, and lack of large amounts of high-resolution training data.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel neural operator architecture called Codomain Attention Neural Operator (CoDA-NO) to address these challenges. 

- CoDA-NO tokenizes functions along the codomain or channel space, treating each physical variable as a token. This allows it to handle varying numbers of interacting physical variables across different PDE systems.

- It extends concepts of positional encoding, self-attention, and normalization from transformers to function spaces to enable learning representations across diverse PDE systems.

- A graph neural operator is used as the encoder-decoder module to handle complex and dynamic geometries.

- The model is pre-trained using a self-supervised objective of reconstructing masked input functions and fine-tuned on downstream tasks with limited supervised data.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a neural operator architecture CoDA-NO that can capture dependencies between physical variables by extending self-attention to function spaces.

- Achieves discretization invariance by formulating transformer operations for infinite dimensional functions.

- Enables self-supervised pre-training on function spaces for diverse PDE systems by handling varying input functions and geometries.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in adapting to new physical systems with very limited data, establishing CoDA-NO as a foundation model for multiphysics problems.

- Provides strong empirical evidence for the model's ability to generalize to unseen physical interactions and variables on complex geometries.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing neural operators that can learn representations across diverse multiphysics PDEs and rapidly adapt to new systems with minimal data.
