# [Adapting HouseDiffusion for conditional Floor Plan generation on   Modified Swiss Dwellings dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of generating feasible room layouts and polygons for the Modified Swiss Dwellings (MSD) dataset, conditioned on a given access graph between rooms and an input mask of structural walls. Compared to previous datasets like RPLAN, MSD has fewer training examples (5k vs 60k), more rooms per floorplan, and room types need to be predicted from zoning types rather than given as input. 

Method:
The paper builds on the HouseDiffusion model, which represents rooms by corner embeddings and refines the layout through neural attention layers. The key modification is to add cross-attention between room corner embeddings and structural corner embeddings derived from the input walls mask. This allows conditioning the layout generation on the structural walls.  

The walls mask is converted to lines using skeletonization and filtering. Room types are predicted using a 3-layer Graph Attention Network from zoning types. Rooms are approximated as minimum rotated rectangles, refined by structural walls, to limit complexity.

Results: 
Qualitative results on a validation set show decent layouts and room alignments, but precision needs improvement. Quantitatively, refining rectangles by structural walls improves IOU. Future work includes assessing the usefulness of the minimum rotated rectangle approximation, finding better ways to encode structural walls, and investigating whether more training data is needed.

Main Contributions:
- Adaptation of the HouseDiffusion model to condition on structural wall inputs through additional cross-attention mechanisms
- Preprocessing pipeline to extract structural walls and predict room types
- Experiments on the MSD dataset demonstrating feasibility of conditioned layout generation, but need for further improvements

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem, method, results and future work, as well as highlighting the main contribution of conditioning an existing layout generation method on structural wall inputs. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.
