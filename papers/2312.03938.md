# [Adapting HouseDiffusion for conditional Floor Plan generation on   Modified Swiss Dwellings dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03938)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of generating feasible room layouts and polygons for the Modified Swiss Dwellings (MSD) dataset, conditioned on a given access graph between rooms and an input mask of structural walls. Compared to previous datasets like RPLAN, MSD has fewer training examples (5k vs 60k), more rooms per floorplan, and room types need to be predicted from zoning types rather than given as input. 

Method:
The paper builds on the HouseDiffusion model, which represents rooms by corner embeddings and refines the layout through neural attention layers. The key modification is to add cross-attention between room corner embeddings and structural corner embeddings derived from the input walls mask. This allows conditioning the layout generation on the structural walls.  

The walls mask is converted to lines using skeletonization and filtering. Room types are predicted using a 3-layer Graph Attention Network from zoning types. Rooms are approximated as minimum rotated rectangles, refined by structural walls, to limit complexity.

Results: 
Qualitative results on a validation set show decent layouts and room alignments, but precision needs improvement. Quantitatively, refining rectangles by structural walls improves IOU. Future work includes assessing the usefulness of the minimum rotated rectangle approximation, finding better ways to encode structural walls, and investigating whether more training data is needed.

Main Contributions:
- Adaptation of the HouseDiffusion model to condition on structural wall inputs through additional cross-attention mechanisms
- Preprocessing pipeline to extract structural walls and predict room types
- Experiments on the MSD dataset demonstrating feasibility of conditioned layout generation, but need for further improvements

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem, method, results and future work, as well as highlighting the main contribution of conditioning an existing layout generation method on structural wall inputs. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper adapts the HouseDiffusion model for conditional floor plan generation to use structural walls as additional input on the Modified Swiss Dwellings dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be adapting the HouseDiffusion model to allow conditioning on structural walls. Specifically:

- The HouseDiffusion architecture is modified by adding a cross-attention operation between each room corner and all structural corners. This allows the model to take into account the structural walls during the floor plan generation process.

- The paper experiments with this modified architecture on the Modified Swiss Dwellings dataset, which requires generating floor plans constrained by structural walls. This demonstrates the capability to condition HouseDiffusion on structural inputs.

- Various data preprocessing steps are introduced to extract the necessary graph and geometric representations from the Modified Swiss Dwellings dataset to serve as inputs to the modified HouseDiffusion model.

So in summary, the key contribution is showing that the HouseDiffusion generative model for floor plan layouts can be adapted to allow conditioning on structural wall constraints, enabling its application to datasets such as Modified Swiss Dwellings. The modifications and experiments demonstrate this capability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper uses minimum rotated rectangles (MRR) to approximate the room polygons. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approximation compared to using the original polygons? How could the quality of the MRR approximation be further improved?

2. The paper uses a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the room types from the zoning types. What were the reasons for choosing a GNN over other models? How was the GNN model optimized and evaluated? What improvements could be made? 

3. The paper adds cross-attention between room corners and structural corners. What is the intuition behind this modification? Were any ablation studies done to evaluate the effect of this cross-attention? 

4. The structural walls are encoded using a separate transformer before being input to the cross-attention. What is the motivation behind this? Were any experiments done without this transformer to evaluate its effect?

5. The model seems to struggle with aligning the generated layout properly with the structural walls. What could be the reasons for this? How could the alignment be improved in the future?

6. The paper uses a relatively small training set of around 3800 examples. Do you think lack of data is a key limitation? How could more training data help improve performance?

7. The post-processing step of refining the polygons using the structural walls helps improve IoU. However, visual inspection shows alignment issues remain. How could this post-processing be improved further?

8. For training, the paper discards floor plans with too many rooms to limit GPU memory usage. Could this discarding introduce a bias? How else could the memory issue be addressed?

9. The quantitative evaluation seems inconsistent between the val set and test set. What could explain this discrepancy? How could the evaluation be made more robust?

10. The paper does not include ablation studies for key modifications to HouseDiffusion. What ablation studies should have been included to better analyze the method?
