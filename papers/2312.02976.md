# [Imitating Shortest Paths in Simulation Enables Effective Navigation and   Manipulation in the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02976)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents SPOC, an embodied navigation and manipulation agent trained via imitation learning to follow shortest path experts in simulation. SPOC uses a transformer-based architecture and is trained on a large-scale procedurally generated dataset of over 200,000 houses with 40,000 unique 3D assets. Surprisingly, despite being trained only to imitate shortest paths, SPOC demonstrates sophisticated exploration and backtracking behaviors in novel environments. When trained on a benchmark suite of tasks including navigation, manipulation, and language grounding, SPOC achieves high success rates of 49.9% in simulation and 56.1% when directly transferred to the real world without any fine-tuning. The authors identify scale, diversity, choice of visual encoder, and transformer architecture as key factors enabling effective simulation-to-real transfer. SPOC significantly outperforms prior reinforcement learning methods and sets a new state-of-the-art on the task suite. Its ability to explore, avoid obstacles, follow instructions, and manipulate objects after training solely on shortest paths in simulation highlights the promise of imitation learning from heuristic planners for real-world robotics.
