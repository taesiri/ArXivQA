# [Adapting Learned Image Codecs to Screen Content via Adjustable   Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Learned image codecs (LICs) have become very efficient at compressing natural images. However, they suffer from poor performance on out-of-distribution data such as screen content (SC) images. Retraining LICs to adapt them to new domains like SC is very difficult without breaking backwards compatibility of already encoded bitstreams. Hence, there is a need for methods to adapt LICs to SC images without modifying the underlying LIC architecture or weights.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose introducing parameterized and invertible linear transformations as prefilters and postfilters around an existing LIC pipeline. This allows adapting the LIC to SC images without retraining the codec itself. Specifically, they use:

1) Desaturation Transformation: Converts image RGB channels towards grayscale to increase compressibility.

2) Compact Representation (CR) Module: A neural network before the codec that adds spatial modulations to input to improve compressibility.

3) Reconstruction Stage (RS) Module: A neural network after the codec to remove artifacts and recover original input from the decoding.

The modules are trained end-to-end with the codec frozen. The transformations help reduce bitrate and the neural networks focus on maximizing quality.

Main Contributions:

- First work to adapt LICs to new domains without retraining the underlying codec by using external differentiable modules

- Introduces parameterized linear transformations along with neural networks as prefilters and postfilters to a codec

- Achieves up to 10% lower bitrate on SC images with only 1% overhead in parameters over baseline LICs

- Performs ablation studies to analyze contribution of each component showing end-to-end training is necessary

- Demonstrates feasibility of adapting any black-box LIC with small modifications to enhance performance on out-of-distribution data

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end trainable framework with linear transformations and neural network modules that can enhance coding efficiency of existing LICs on SC images without retraining the codec itself.
