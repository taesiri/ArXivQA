# [No more optimization rules: LLM-enabled policy-based multi-modal query   optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13597)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capability for query planning. However, their ability for query optimization has not been studied. Query optimization is critical for efficient query execution.  
- Existing query optimizers rely on manually created rules, which does not scale for multi-modal queries across text, images, etc. Designing an optimizer with enumeration of multi-modal rules is time-consuming. 
- LLMs provide an opportunity to build optimizer without needing explicit rules, but it has not been explored.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose LaPuda, an LLM and policy based multi-modal query optimizer, which uses abstract policies instead of rules.
- A key novelty is the guided cost descent (GCD) algorithm and two-level guidance strategy. GCD provides coarse error-driven guidance to fix invalid plans, and finer cost-based guidance to optimize direction.  
- The guidance helps LLM optimize plans without negative impact. The supervisor checks for structural and semantic equivalence of plans.
- A cost model estimates plan costs for guidance. Aggregation selects best candidate plan.

Main Contributions:  
- First LLM based optimizer explored; saves significant human effort in rule design
- Novel GCD algorithm and two guidance levels prevent negative optimization 
- Effective use of aggregation and cost model to pick best plans
- Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning methods on multi-modal optimization
- Up to 2x speedup compared to baselines by executing LLM optimized plans
- First step towards next-generation LLM-centered optimizer in multi-modal era

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to build multi-modal query optimizer using LLM, without needing manual rules. A key innovation is the guided optimization process using two-level guidance and cost models to prevent negative impact. Experiments show promising results surpassing other reasoning methods.
