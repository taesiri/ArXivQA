# [Causal discovery from conditionally stationary time-series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06257v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we perform causal discovery from time-series data where the underlying dynamics are not stationary, but rather change depending on an underlying state variable? 

The key hypothesis is that by conditioning the stationarity of time-series data on categorical state variables, it is possible to recover the underlying causal structure even when the dynamics are not stationary overall.

In particular, the paper proposes a method called State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI) to address this problem. The main ideas are:

- Model the dynamics as conditionally stationary given an underlying state variable
- Infer a causal summary graph that describes the edge interactions conditioned on the state 
- Learn functions to infer the state-conditioned causal graph and fit it to the dynamics

The method is evaluated on two synthetic datasets where the dynamics change according to different state transition schemes. The main result is that SDCI can accurately recover the causal graph structure even when the states are hidden, demonstrating its effectiveness for conditional non-stationary time-series.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that conditioning on state variables enables causal discovery in non-stationary time-series, and SDCI provides an effective algorithmic approach to achieve this. The experiments on synthetic data provide supporting evidence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a new method called State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI) for performing causal discovery from time-series data where the dynamics depend on an underlying state variable. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Formulating the problem of causal discovery from conditionally stationary time-series, where the stationarity is conditioned on a categorical state variable. This allows modeling more complex real-world scenarios where system dynamics change depending on underlying factors.

- Proposing the SDCI method which can extract state-dependent causal graphs from such time-series data by conditioning the causal structure on states. This allows handling non-stationarity.

- Providing a probabilistic deep learning implementation of SDCI using ideas from variational autoencoders. The method has an encoder to infer a latent causal graph conditioned on states, and a decoder to model system dynamics based on the inferred graph.

- Evaluating SDCI on two synthetic datasets with different types of system dynamics and state variables. Experiments cover scenarios ranging from observed independent states to complex hidden state dependencies.

- Results showing SDCI can accurately recover ground truth causal graphs in these conditional time-series settings, significantly outperforming prior methods that assume stationarity.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel SDCI formulation and method for the new problem of causal discovery in conditionally stationary time-series, along with providing an implementation and demonstrating its effectiveness on complex synthetic datasets. This represents an advance over prior work that handles only stationary dynamics.
