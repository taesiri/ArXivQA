# [What Are Tools Anyway? A Survey from the Language Model Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15452)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) struggle with complex reasoning tasks and lack real-world knowledge/perception abilities on their own. Tools can help facilitate and extend LM abilities, but there is no unified definition or systematic understanding of tools for LMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a unified definition of tools as external program interfaces that LMs can call to facilitate/extend abilities.
- Systematically review tool usage scenarios, methods, evaluations, and efficiency trade-offs:
  - Scenarios: Knowledge access, computation, world interaction, multimodal tasks, accessing specialized LMs.
  - Methods: Complex tool selection/usage, tools in programmatic contexts, tool creation. 
  - Evaluations: Repurposed datasets, API benchmarks; metrics - task completion, tool selection accuracy, tool reusability. 
  - Efficiency trade-offs: Tools most useful for multi-domain APIs, math problems; training approaches more expensive but faster at inference.

Main Contributions:
- Unified definition and taxonomy of tools for LMs
- First systematic review covering scenarios, advanced methods, evaluations and efficiency of tool use
- Concrete suggestions to improve evaluations: efficiency, tool quality, reliability, reproducible testing, safe usage
- Analysis and guidelines on when tools are most useful and efficient methods to use them

The paper provides a holistic understanding of tools for LMs through its systematic review, taxonomy and analyses. It also offers concrete suggestions for better evaluations and actionable guidelines on efficient tool usage.
