# [ConvNets Match Vision Transformers at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16764)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether ConvNets can match the performance of Vision Transformers when given access to very large datasets and compute budgets for pre-training. 

The abstract states:

"We evaluate the scaling properties of the NFNet model family, a pure convolutional architecture published concurrently with the first ViT papers, and the last ConvNet to set a new SOTA on ImageNet. We do not make any changes to the model architecture or the training procedure (beyond tuning simple hyper-parameters such as the learning rate or epoch budget). We consider compute budgets up to a maximum of 110k TPU-v4 core hours, and pre-train on the JFT-4B dataset which contains roughly 4 billion labelled images from 30k classes. We observe a log-log scaling law between validation loss and the compute budget used to pre-train the model. After fine-tuning on ImageNet, our networks match the performance of pre-trained ViTs with comparable compute budgets."

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that ConvNets can match the performance of Vision Transformers on large datasets if given comparable compute budgets during pre-training. The authors evaluate this by pre-training a ConvNet architecture (NFNet) on a very large dataset (JFT-4B) using large compute budgets, and showing it achieves comparable performance to Vision Transformers after fine-tuning on ImageNet.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that ConvNets can match the performance of Vision Transformers on large-scale image classification tasks when given similar amounts of compute and data during pre-training. 

Specifically, the authors show that by pre-training the NFNet family of ConvNets on up to 110K TPU-v4 core hours using the JFT dataset, they are able to achieve 90.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet after fine-tuning. This is comparable to recent results from pre-trained Vision Transformers like ViT and SoViT that used similar amounts of compute and data. 

The key findings are:

- There is a clear log-log scaling relationship between compute used for pre-training ConvNets and held-out loss/accuracy after fine-tuning. This matches scaling laws seen for transformers in NLP tasks.

- The optimal model size and training epochs increase with more available compute, similar to findings in NLP.

- With sufficient compute and data, ConvNets can match Vision Transformers for image classification without changes to model architecture or training procedures. 

Overall, this challenges the notion that Vision Transformers inherently outscale ConvNets, and shows that compute and data are still the primary factors driving performance rather than architectural choices. The results suggest ConvNets remain competitive for computer vision if provided with resources comparable to what Vision Transformers have used.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

Training pure convolutional networks (ConvNets) at scale matches the performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs); there is no clear evidence that ViTs outperform ConvNets given similar compute budgets for pre-training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) and vision transformers (ViTs):

- The paper challenges the notion that ViTs consistently outperform ConvNets given the same training data and compute budget. Many previous papers have claimed ViTs have better scaling properties but the evidence is limited.

- The authors demonstrate ConvNets can match ViTs by pre-training a series of NFNet models on a very large dataset (JFT-4B) using up to 110k TPU-v4 core hours. After fine-tuning on ImageNet, the ConvNets match ViTs pre-trained with similar budgets.

- This suggests the superior performance of ViTs may simply be due to them being pre-trained with larger datasets and compute budgets, rather than the architecture itself being fundamentally better. With proper scaling, ConvNets remain competitive.

- The results reinforce the importance of the "bitter lesson" - with sufficient data and compute, fairly basic model architectures can achieve excellent performance. Model architecture alone is less crucial than scale.

- The paper does not make changes to the NFNet architecture or training process, demonstrating the strength of the original model. Many other ConvNet papers propose architectural modifications or training tweaks.

- The scaling laws and optimal hyperparameter values observed align with those from language modeling, suggesting general principles for scaling models.

In summary, this paper provides solid evidence that ConvNets can match ViTs given large resources, challenging claims that ViTs intrinsically outscale ConvNets. The results highlight the primacy of scale over innovations in model architecture.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring convolutional-attention hybrid architectures that combine strengths of ConvNets and Vision Transformers. The authors note promising results have been obtained with models like CoAtNet, and believe these hybrids may outperform pure ConvNets and ViTs.

- Training even larger ConvNet models using more compute and data. The authors show ConvNets continue to improve with more scale, so pushing this further with larger models, datasets, and compute budgets could lead to additional gains.

- Studying what causes the gap between best JFT validation loss and best ImageNet accuracy after transfer. The authors observe a gap where the best pre-trained models don't always transfer best, suggesting more work to understand transfer learning dynamics.

- Evaluating relative advantages of ConvNets and ViTs in different practical contexts. The authors believe both can achieve similar performance but ViTs may have advantages for multi-modality, while ConvNets are optimized for TPUs. More analysis of tradeoffs could guide model selection.

- Exploring other model families besides ConvNets and Transformers. While the paper focuses on comparing ConvNets and ViTs, developing novel architectures beyond these two could lead to models better suited for vision tasks.

In summary, the main directions are exploring convolutional-attention hybrids, scaling up ConvNets further, better understanding transfer learning, evaluating contextual tradeoffs between model families, and developing new model architectures tailored for vision. More work in these areas could yield additional progress in computer vision.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper challenges the notion that Vision Transformers (ViTs) consistently outperform ConvNets when given access to very large datasets and compute budgets for pre-training. The authors take an existing high-performing convolutional neural network architecture called NFNet and pre-train scaled up versions on up to 110k TPU-v4 core hours using the JFT dataset. They show NFNet obeys similar log-log scaling laws between compute and loss as transformers during pre-training. When fine-tuned on ImageNet, the scaled up NFNet models match ViTs in accuracy for similar pre-training compute budgets, with the largest NFNet achieving 90.4% top-1 accuracy. The authors conclude that with sufficient data and compute, properly designed ConvNets can match ViTs, and the choice of architecture is less important than scale.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates the scaling properties of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) compared to vision transformers (ViTs). The authors train a series of NFNet convolutional models of increasing size and compute budget on the large JFT dataset. They observe a clear log-log scaling law between model size, compute budget, and validation loss. After fine-tuning on ImageNet, the NFNet models achieve accuracy comparable to ViTs with similar pre-training compute. Their largest model achieves 90.4% ImageNet top-1 accuracy after pre-training on 110k TPU hours and fine-tuning on 1.6k TPU hours. 

The key conclusion is that properly scaled ConvNets can match the performance of ViTs. While many believe ViTs have better scaling properties, the authors show ConvNets also benefit from increased model size and compute. With similar model scale and datasets, differences between ViTs and ConvNets are small. The results reinforce the importance of compute and data rather than model architecture. This suggests fairly-evaluated ConvNets remain competitive with ViTs for computer vision tasks.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper evaluates the scaling properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by training models from the NFNet family on the large JFT-4B image dataset. The authors train NFNet models of increasing depth and width, with pre-training compute budgets ranging from 0.4k to 110k TPU-v4 core hours. They observe a log-log scaling law between validation loss on held-out data and compute budget. After fine-tuning on ImageNet, the performance of these scaled up NFNet models matches that of vision transformers (ViTs) pre-trained with similar compute budgets. The results suggest that properly scaled CNNs can match the performance of ViTs, and the most important factors determining model performance are compute and data rather than architectural choices between CNNs and ViTs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is investigating whether convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) can match the performance of vision transformers (ViTs) when pre-trained at scale on large datasets. 

Specifically, it challenges the belief that ViTs outperform ConvNets when given access to web-scale datasets. The key question is whether ViTs show better scaling properties and performance compared to ConvNets when trained with similar computational budgets.
