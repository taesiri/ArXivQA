# [Model Editing with Canonical Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06155)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper introduces "model editing with canonical examples", where the goal is to improve language models by providing a single simple example per desired behavior change. The setting has 3 key aspects: (1) learning from a single example, (2) generalizing to more complex out-of-distribution examples, (3) strictly limiting deviation from the original model to avoid catastrophic forgetting. For example, providing the statement "The capital of Mauritius is Port Louis" to teach that fact.

Solution:
The authors create 6 datasets covering knowledge, debiasing, and syntactic improvements. They evaluate finetuning methods like full finetuning and LoRA on Pythia LMs. They find LoRA works best but improvements are limited. 

They then leverage the Backpack LM architecture which has interpretable "sense vectors" for words. They propose a new "sense finetuning" method which selects and finetunes a small number of sense vectors per example. This outperforms other methods, e.g. 4.8% vs 0.3% improvement.

Finally, they show sense-finetuned Backpacks can be used to improve bigger models like GPT-J via an ensemble method. Remarkably, this outperforms finetuning GPT-J directly, showing Backpacks are more editable.

Main Contributions:
- Formalized the "model editing with canonical examples" setting 
- Created 6 new datasets for evaluating targeted model improvements
- Proposed "sense finetuning" for Backpack models that works better than other methods
- Demonstrated improving large models by editing smaller Backpacks, showing editability can be separated from scale

Overall the key insight is that model architectures can be explicitly designed to enable precise editing, and smaller editable models can improve state-of-the-art larger models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key ideas from the paper:

The paper introduces model editing with canonical examples, a setting for evaluating targeted language model improvements using simple but descriptive training examples and strict constraints on model deviation, and shows that methods leveraging interpretable lexical components of models like Backpack's sense vectors can reliably make focused edits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces the setting of "model editing with canonical examples", which focuses on learning from a single example, evaluating out-of-distribution generalization, and strictly limiting catastrophic forgetting.

2) It creates and adapts 6 datasets for evaluating model editing methods in areas like knowledge improvement, debiasing, and learning syntactic edge cases.

3) It evaluates several finetuning methods like full finetuning, LoRA, and MEMIT on these datasets using Pythia language models, finding that LoRA works best.

4) It proposes a new finetuning method called "sense finetuning" for Backpack models, which automatically selects a small number of sense vectors to update. This outperforms other methods.  

5) It shows how sense finetuning on a small Backpack model can be used to improve a much larger model like GPT-J in an ensemble, sometimes even outperforming finetuning GPT-J directly.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing the canonical example setting, new datasets, evaluating methods on Pythia LMs, proposing sense finetuning, and showing how to use it to improve large LMs like GPT-J.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Model editing - The concept of making targeted updates to language models to fix issues or improve performance. A main focus of the paper.

- Canonical examples - Simple training examples that demonstrate a desired or undesired behavior. Used to make updates to models.

- Out-of-distribution generalization - Evaluating model updates on more complex, naturalistic data that differs from the simple canonical examples.

- Catastrophic forgetting - When updating a model leads to degraded performance on the original data/tasks. Strictly limited in this paper's setting.  

- LoRA finetuning - A parameter-efficient finetuning method based on low-rank updates. Tested as an approach.

- Backpack architecture - A recently introduced model architecture designed to enable targeted improvements. Leveraged in this work.  

- Sense vectors - Word representations in Backpack models that encode different meanings/uses of words. Sense finetuning updates these.

- Sense finetuning - Proposed method that automatically selects and finetunes a small number of sense vectors to update models based on canonical examples.

- Inference-time ensembling - Technique shown at end of paper to leverage sense-finetuned small Backpack models to improve much larger models like GPT-J without changing GPT-J itself.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes "sense finetuning" for the Backpack model architecture. What specifically does this method entail and how does it leverage the sense vectors in Backpack?

2. How does the proposed "sense finetuning" method compare to other finetuning techniques like full finetuning and LoRA finetuning? What are the key advantages and limitations?

3. The paper evaluates the methods on a variety of tasks like knowledge improvement, debiasing, and handling syntactic edge cases. Why are these good test cases for model editing techniques? What aspects do they stress test?  

4. What were some key findings from the experiments on editing Pythia LMs of varying sizes? How did the methods compare and what does this suggest about model scale versus editability?

5. The paper proposes an inference-time ensemble to improve large LMs like GPT-J using a sense finetuned Backpack. Can you explain this approach and why it is able to outperform finetuning GPT-J directly?

6. What is the motivation behind the "model editing with canonical examples" setting proposed in the paper? How is it different from other model editing paradigms?

7. The paper argues that model architecture can have implications for editability separate from base capabilities. Can you expand on this concept and discuss the tradeoffs at play?

8. How exactly does the sense finetuning gradient update the Backpack sense vectors? What causes it to specialize them to the desired behaviors in the canonical examples?  

9. The paper finds finetuning methods are very sensitive to hyperparameters when strictly limiting model deviation. Why might this be the case? Are there ways to make editing more robust?

10. The paper uses several techniques to limit catastrophic forgetting, like KL divergence regularization. Can you discuss the role of continual learning methods for model editing and whether they are sufficient?
