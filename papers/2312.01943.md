# [Instance-guided Cartoon Editing with a Large-scale Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01943)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for high-quality instance segmentation of cartoon images to enable advanced cartoon editing applications. The key contributions include: (1) a large-scale high-resolution cartoon segmentation dataset of over 98,000 images prepared using a reverse engineering method based on chroma keying and illustration synthesis; (2) a two-stage instance-aware segmentation model tailored for cartoons that first locates rough masks for each instance then refines them into high-resolution masks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Grounded SAM and YAAS; and (3) demonstrations of how the extracted precise instance masks can significantly streamline segmentation-dependent workflows for effects like 3D Ken Burns parallax animation, text-guided style editing with consistency between instances, and puppet animation from single illustrations. Limitations still exist when handling crowded ambiguous regions. Overall, this work delivers a high-quality dataset and model for detailed cartoon instance extraction to facilitate advanced creative editing.
