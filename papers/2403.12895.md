# [mPLUG-DocOwl 1.5: Unified Structure Learning for OCR-free Document   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack abilities to understand complex textual and structural information in text-rich document images like documents, tables, charts etc. 
- They are not specifically optimized to represent the textual and layout information in such images.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a unified structure learning approach across 5 domains - documents, tables, charts, webpages, natural images to empower MLLMs to understand text-rich images.
- Unified structure learning involves:
  - Structure-aware parsing tasks to teach model to parse text contents and layout.
  - Multi-grained text localization tasks to correlate texts with positions.
- Designed a spatial-aware vision-to-text module named H-Reducer to maintain layout information and reduce length of visual features.
- Constructed a comprehensive dataset DocStruct4M with structure-aware sequences and text-bounding box pairs to support unified structure learning.  

Main Contributions:
- First work to propose unified structure learning on text-rich images for MLLMs across 5 domains with structure-aware parsing and multi-grained localization tasks.
- Designed H-Reducer module to better represent structure and spatial information in images. 
- Constructed DocStruct4M dataset for unified structure learning of text-rich images.
- Achieved new SOTA results on 10 text-rich image understanding benchmarks, improving over MLLMs by 10+ points on 5 tasks.

In summary, the paper focuses on empowering MLLMs to understand layout and textual information in diverse text-rich images by proposing a unified structure learning approach along with a spatial-aware vision-to-text module and dataset. This leads to new state-of-the-art OCR-free results on multiple text-rich image understanding benchmarks.
