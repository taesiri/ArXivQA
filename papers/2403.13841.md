# [Integrating Wearable Sensor Data and Self-reported Diaries for   Personalized Affect Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current affect detection systems rely primarily on objective sensor data and neglect valuable self-reported textual data like diaries. They also focus only on short-term detection rather than longer-term forecasting of affect status.

- There is a need for models that can forecast affect status farther in advance using both objective multi-modal sensor data as well as self-reported diaries, to enable more timely prevention strategies.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multimodal deep learning model combining a Transformer encoder and pre-trained language model DistilBERT to forecast affect status 1 week in advance. 

- The model integrates both objective features (physiological, sleep, activity data) from wearables and self-reported diaries, specifically extracting diary content features and diary submission frequency features.

- A two-step training strategy first fine-tunes DistilBERT on the affect forecasting task before end-to-end training of the full model.

Contributions:
- Conducts a longitudinal study collecting extensive multimodal dataset from college students including sensor data and self-reported diaries over 1 year.

- Achieves forecasting accuracy of 82.5% for positive affect and 82.76% for negative affect one week in advance, comparable to state-of-the-art for next-day detection.

- Demonstrates value of incorporating self-reported diaries - improves accuracy over using objective features alone.

- Provides model explainability by analyzing contribution of individual features and attention to keywords in diaries.

- Emphasizes importance of personalized models tailored to individuals' behavioral and emotional patterns.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling longer-term affect status forecasting by fusing multimodal objective sensor data and subjective self-reported diaries using deep learning. Personalization and explainability are also notable aspects. The accuracy achieved highlights feasibility and potential for more timely mental health interventions.
