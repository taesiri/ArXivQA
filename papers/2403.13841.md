# [Integrating Wearable Sensor Data and Self-reported Diaries for   Personalized Affect Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current affect detection systems rely primarily on objective sensor data and neglect valuable self-reported textual data like diaries. They also focus only on short-term detection rather than longer-term forecasting of affect status.

- There is a need for models that can forecast affect status farther in advance using both objective multi-modal sensor data as well as self-reported diaries, to enable more timely prevention strategies.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a multimodal deep learning model combining a Transformer encoder and pre-trained language model DistilBERT to forecast affect status 1 week in advance. 

- The model integrates both objective features (physiological, sleep, activity data) from wearables and self-reported diaries, specifically extracting diary content features and diary submission frequency features.

- A two-step training strategy first fine-tunes DistilBERT on the affect forecasting task before end-to-end training of the full model.

Contributions:
- Conducts a longitudinal study collecting extensive multimodal dataset from college students including sensor data and self-reported diaries over 1 year.

- Achieves forecasting accuracy of 82.5% for positive affect and 82.76% for negative affect one week in advance, comparable to state-of-the-art for next-day detection.

- Demonstrates value of incorporating self-reported diaries - improves accuracy over using objective features alone.

- Provides model explainability by analyzing contribution of individual features and attention to keywords in diaries.

- Emphasizes importance of personalized models tailored to individuals' behavioral and emotional patterns.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling longer-term affect status forecasting by fusing multimodal objective sensor data and subjective self-reported diaries using deep learning. Personalization and explainability are also notable aspects. The accuracy achieved highlights feasibility and potential for more timely mental health interventions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning model that combines objective data from wearable devices and self-reported diaries to forecast college students' positive and negative affect status a week in advance with over 80% accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The paper proposes a multimodal deep learning model for affect status forecasting that combines objective sensor data from wearable devices (physiological, environmental, sleep, metabolic, physical activity data) with self-reported diary data. The key benefits and main contributions of this model are:

1) It can forecast positive and negative affect status a full week in advance, with accuracy over 80% for both. This allows more lead time for prevention and intervention compared to prior day-ahead prediction models.

2) It incorporates both objective sensor data and subjective self-reported diary data. The inclusion of diary data, specifically diary content analyzed by DistilBERT and diary submission frequency, improves forecasting accuracy over using objective data alone.

3) The model is explainable through analysis of feature Shapley values and attention scores to diary keywords. This provides insight into how different data modalities and features influence the affect forecasting.

4) Personalized models tailored to an individual's data patterns are shown to outperform non-personalized models, demonstrating the value of personalization in mental health monitoring.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of multimodal data including both sensor and diary data via a transformer-based model to enable personalized and explainable forecasting of affect status a full week in advance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a transformer encoder in the predictive model architecture. What are the benefits of using a transformer encoder over other sequence models like RNNs or CNNs for this multimodal affect forecasting task?

2. The paper extracts two main features from the self-reported diaries - diary content and diary submission frequency. Why are both these features important for affect forecasting? What additional diary features could be extracted to further improve the model performance?

3. The paper uses a two-step training process - first fine-tuning the DistilBERT model and then training the full model end-to-end. Why is this two-step approach preferred over joint training? How does it help prevent the diary features from being omitted?

4. For explainability, Shapley values are used to analyze feature importance. What are some pros and cons of using Shapley values over other methods like LIME or integrated gradients? Are there any limitations in how they are used for explainability in this paper?

5. The personalized models outperform the non-personalized models in forecasting accuracy. Why does personalization help in improving affect prediction? What are some challenges in deploying personalized affect forecasting models?

6. The paper evaluates forecasting accuracy with a one week delay. How does this time frame for prediction compare to other existing works on affect detection/forecasting? What are the limitations in forecasting further into the future?

7. What additional modalities could be incorporated along with the wearable sensor data and diaries to potentially improve affect forecasting? For example - voice, video, or social media data.

8. How was the label distribution for positive and negative affect ensured to be balanced for training the models? What are some better evaluation metrics than simple accuracy for imbalanced classification tasks?  

9. The paper evaluates accuracy using cross-validation on collected dataset. What are some limitations of this evaluation approach? How could the model be validated in a real-world deployment?

10. How was the DistilBERT model customized for the affect forecasting task during fine-tuning in the first step? What affect-specific datasets were used? What modifications could further improve its representations for this task?
