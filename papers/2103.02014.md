# [Online Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02014)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How feasible are adversarial attacks in an online setting where data arrives as a stream, and attackers must make irrevocable decisions about whether to attack each instance as it arrives?The key elements that make this an open research question are:1) The online nature of the threat model, where data arrives sequentially and decisions about attacking each instance must be made immediately without knowledge of future instances. 2) The constraints this places on attackers in terms of budget and information. Attackers can only attack a small fraction of instances to remain undetected, and they lack full information about the data stream or target model.3) The lack of existing approaches that can craft adversarial examples under these constraints of a transient data stream. Prior work has focused on static datasets.The paper aims to rigorously analyze this online threat model, propose algorithms suited to this setting, and empirically demonstrate their effectiveness on image classifiers. The feasibility of online attacks in such a constrained setting was an open question that this paper tries to address through both theory and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces a new "online threat model" for studying adversarial attacks against streaming data. The two key aspects of this threat model are:1) Attackers must operate under partial knowledge of the target model, using a surrogate model to craft attacks. 2) The attacker must make irrevocable decisions on whether to attack each data point as it arrives in the stream. Attacked data points cannot be revisited later.The main contributions are:- Formalizing the online threat model and connecting it to the theoretical computer science problem of the "k-secretary problem". - Proposing a new online algorithm called Virtual+ for selecting which data points to attack in the streaming setting. Theoretical analysis shows Virtual+ achieves near optimal performance.- Introducing a "stochastic k-secretary problem" to model uncertainty in the surrogate model's loss estimates. Bounds are proven on the competitive ratio under this stochastic setting.- Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of online attacks, the importance of carefully selecting which points to attack, and some counterintuitive phenomena unique to the online setting.Overall, the paper opens up a new direction in adversarial attack research by considering the realistic constraint of attacking streaming data under partial knowledge. The connections to secretary problems provide a theoretical foundation for developing online attack algorithms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR of the paper:The paper proposes a new online adversarial attack threat model against streaming data where attackers must make irrevocable decisions under partial knowledge, draws connections to the k-secretary problem in computer science, and introduces a practical online algorithm called Virtual+ with proven competitive ratio guarantees that enables simple attackers to achieve high attack success rates when paired with optimal online selection strategies.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on online adversarial attacks compares to other related work:- It proposes a new threat model, the online adversarial attack setting, that captures attacking streaming data. This is different from prior work that focuses on static datasets. The online setting imposes new constraints like making irrevocable attack decisions on transient data points.- The paper connects the online attack problem to the k-secretary problem in theoretical computer science. This allows the application of online algorithms from that domain. Prior work has not made this connection to study online attacks.- The paper analyzes the competitive ratio of a novel online algorithm called Virtual+ for the stochastic k-secretary problem. This analysis extends the theory on single threshold algorithms. - Experiments demonstrate strong attack success on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenet classifiers using online algorithms. Prior work either lacks experiments or evaluations in restricted whitebox settings unlike the challenging blackbox transfer setting here.- The results reveal counterintuitive phenomena unique to online attacks. For example, attacking robust models can be easier than non-robust ones based on the online value distribution. Simple attacks like FGSM can also outperform stronger ones like PGD when paired with the right online selection algorithm.In summary, this paper introduces a new threat model, connects it to theoretical computer science, advances the theory of online algorithms, and conducts extensive experiments revealing new insights unique to the online attack setting. The formalization of this new problem opens up many directions for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Investigating the optimal threshold values for \algoname\ for larger values of k. The paper analyzes \algoname\ for small values of k (k<5) and shows it achieves state-of-the-art competitive ratios compared to prior work. However, analyzing and deriving theoretical guarantees for larger k values is posed as an interesting open question.- Competitive analysis of \algoname\ and other online algorithms in more general stochastic settings. The paper analyzes a specific stochastic variant called the "stochastic k-secretary problem" but suggests more analysis could be done for broader noise models. - Empirical evaluation of online algorithms on a wider range of datasets, models, and attack strategies. The paper conducts experiments primarily on MNIST and CIFAR-10 but suggests expanding the empirical analysis to study the interplay between attack strategies and online algorithms in more diverse settings.- Developing online algorithms that adaptively set their thresholds/hyperparameters based on observed data. The paper uses fixed predetermined thresholds but notes that adaptive data-driven approaches could be promising.- Designing efficient stateful defense strategies tailored to mitigating these types of online attacks. The threat model exposes risks of online attacks, and the paper suggests developing defenses specifically aimed at detecting and limiting such attacks as an important direction.In summary, the main suggested future directions are: 1) theoretical analysis for larger k, 2) broader stochastic analysis, 3) more comprehensive empirical evaluation, 4) adaptive online algorithms, and 5) tailored defense strategies. The paper lays solid groundwork and poses these as interesting open questions stemming from their novel online threat model.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper formalizes the online adversarial attack problem, where an adversary must attack a target model using a stream of data that arrives sequentially. Two key constraints are imposed: the attacker must operate with only partial knowledge of the target model, and decisions to attack each data point are irrevocable. First, the paper draws a connection between this problem and the well-studied k-secretary problem in theoretical computer science. Based on this, they propose Virtual+, a simple yet effective algorithm for selecting which data points to attack. They prove competitive ratio bounds for Virtual+ that improve on prior algorithms. Second, the paper introduces a stochastic variant of the k-secretary problem to model uncertainty in the adversary's estimates of each data point's value. Under mild assumptions, they prove Virtual+ retains provable guarantees in this noisy setting. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of online attack algorithms, enabling even simple attacks like FGSM to achieve high attack rates. Key findings include the advantage of online algorithms over naive selection, the ability to attack robust models, and the complex interplay between attack strategy and online selection. Overall, the paper formalizes and provides an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis of online adversarial attacks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an online adversarial attack threat model where the adversary must make irrevocable decisions about attacking a data stream in an online fashion. The method draws parallels between this threat model and the k-secretary problem in computer science. Based on this connection, the authors propose using online algorithms for the k-secretary problem, like Virtual+, to optimally select data points in the stream to attack within a budget. They also introduce a stochastic variant of the k-secretary problem to model uncertainty about the target model's loss, and analyze the theoretical guarantees of different online algorithms in this setting. The bulk of the paper analyzes Virtual+ theoretically and proves competitive ratio guarantees that improve on prior algorithms. Empirically, the method combines different online algorithms with fixed attack strategies like FGSM to attack streaming test data from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet classifiers in a challenging blackbox transfer setting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my review, the key points of this paper are:- The paper formalizes the online adversarial attack problem, where an attacker must make irrevocable decisions to attack or not attack data points as they arrive in a stream. This is in contrast to most prior adversarial attack settings that assume full access to a static dataset. - The online adversarial attack problem is connected to the k-secretary problem in theoretical computer science. The k-secretary problem involves selecting k high value candidates from a stream of applicants when their values are only revealed upon arrival. - The paper proposes a new algorithm called Virtual+ for solving the online adversarial attack problem by adapting algorithms for the k-secretary problem. Virtual+ is analyzed theoretically and shown to achieve near optimal competitive ratio for small k.- Experiments are conducted using Virtual+ and other online algorithms against MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classifiers. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of online attacks, and interestingly show simple attacks like FGSM can outperform stronger attacks like PGD when paired with the right online selection algorithm.- Overall, the paper introduces and formalizes an important new threat model for adversarial attacks that captures real-world constraints faced by attackers on streaming data. Both the theory and experiments highlight the importance of intelligent online selection of which points to attack.In summary, the key focus is formalizing and demonstrating attacks on streaming data where decisions must be made online with limited knowledge, as opposed to most prior adversarial attack settings that assume full static access to the data.
