# [Online Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02014)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How feasible are adversarial attacks in an online setting where data arrives as a stream, and attackers must make irrevocable decisions about whether to attack each instance as it arrives?The key elements that make this an open research question are:1) The online nature of the threat model, where data arrives sequentially and decisions about attacking each instance must be made immediately without knowledge of future instances. 2) The constraints this places on attackers in terms of budget and information. Attackers can only attack a small fraction of instances to remain undetected, and they lack full information about the data stream or target model.3) The lack of existing approaches that can craft adversarial examples under these constraints of a transient data stream. Prior work has focused on static datasets.The paper aims to rigorously analyze this online threat model, propose algorithms suited to this setting, and empirically demonstrate their effectiveness on image classifiers. The feasibility of online attacks in such a constrained setting was an open question that this paper tries to address through both theory and experiments.
