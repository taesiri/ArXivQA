# [ProSparse: Introducing and Enhancing Intrinsic Activation Sparsity   within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA mostly use non-ReLU activations like GELU and Swish, which lack intrinsic activation sparsity. 
- Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements in activation outputs, which can be leveraged to accelerate inference.
- Some works try to introduce ReLU activations to achieve sparsity, but fail to reach high sparsity without compromising performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ProSparse, an effective progressive ReLUfication method to introduce high activation sparsity into non-ReLU LLMs without decreasing performance.

Main Steps of ProSparse:
1) Replace original activation with ReLU and continue training to adapt to ReLU first.
2) Progressively increase L1 regularization factor on activations in multiple stages - starts low for warmup then increases smoothly over stages. This avoids radical distribution shifts.  
3) Shift ReLU threshold to positive value to further prune unimportant activations.

Contributions:
- Obtain 89.32% and 88.80% activation sparsity for LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with ProSparse, without performance drop.
- Demonstrate practical acceleration effects of higher sparsity using approximate and accurate algorithms. Higher sparsity leads to more acceleration.
- Analyze sparsity over training process, dataset components and layers to explain ProSparse's effectiveness in boosting sparsity smoothly without comprising performance or load balance.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective progressive method ProSparse to introduce high activation sparsity into non-sparse LLMs, analyzes the sparsity deeply and demonstrates practical acceleration effects.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an effective method called ProSparse to introduce high activation sparsity into large language models with non-ReLU activations, through progressive regularization and threshold shifting, achieving comparable performance to the original models and accelerated inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing ProSparse, an effective ReLUfication method that converts non-ReLU large language models (LLMs) into much sparser ReLU-activated LLMs without decreasing model performance.

2. Obtaining sparsely-activated versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B that are comparable to their original Swish-activated versions in performance. These models are made available. 

3. Demonstrating the practical inference acceleration effect brought by the higher activation sparsity that ProSparse can achieve. Experiments show significant speedup on both approximate and accurate acceleration algorithms.

So in summary, the paper introduces an effective method to introduce high activation sparsity to non-ReLU LLMs, obtains sparse LLM models without performance drop, and shows their practical acceleration value.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a 3-step method called ProSparse to enhance activation sparsity in large language models. Can you explain in detail the rationale behind each of the 3 steps - activation function substitution, progressive sparsity regularization, and activation threshold shifting? 

2. The progressive sparsity regularization increases the regularization factor $\lambda$ gradually based on a sine function schedule. What is the motivation behind using a sine schedule rather than a simple linear increase? How does this help prevent radical shifts in the activation distribution?

3. Activation threshold shifting is claimed to help improve sparsity in the lower layers. Can you analyze why the lower layers tend to have lower sparsity compared to higher layers in the first place? 

4. The paper demonstrates practical acceleration from higher sparsity using both approximate and accurate algorithms. Can you summarize the key differences in mechanisms between these two categories of algorithms in leveraging activation sparsity?

5. One of the metrics used to evaluate approximate acceleration algorithms is activation recall. Explain what activation recall refers to and why it is an important metric in analyzing the practical speedup potential.  

6. The accurate acceleration algorithms in the paper implement custom sparse GPU operators. Can you explain some of the key optimizations like operator fusion, memory access patterns etc. that have been applied in these operators?

7. ProSparse obtains higher sparsity on more formatted datasets like QA compared to free-form text. Analyze the potential reasons behind this phenomenon and discuss its practical implications.

8. The activation predictors used for approximate acceleration algorithms are claimed to perform better for models with higher sparsity. Explain the underlying reasons behind why higher sparsity leads to better predictor performance.

9. Discuss the limitations of focusing only on sparsification of the feedforward layers. What are some potential directions for future work to address these limitations? 

10. The paper demonstrates results on 7B and 13B parameter models. How do you think the conclusions might change if applied to much larger models with over 100B parameters?
