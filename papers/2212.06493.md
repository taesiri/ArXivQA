# [Pixel is All You Need: Adversarial Trajectory-Ensemble Active Learning   for Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06493)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether a saliency model trained on weak point-level supervision can achieve equivalent performance to a model trained on dense pixel-wise supervision. The key hypothesis the authors propose and aim to validate is:"There exists a point-labeled dataset where saliency models trained on it can achieve equivalent performance when trained on the corresponding pixel-wise annotated dataset."In other words, the authors hypothesize that dense pixel-wise annotation is unnecessary and a sparsely annotated point-labeled dataset can enable a saliency model to reach the same level of performance. The paper aims to prove this hypothesis and find such a point-labeled dataset.The main contributions and innovations proposed to address this question include:1) An adversarial attack method to trigger and identify uncertain pixels that existing active learning methods fail on.2) A trajectory ensemble technique to efficiently estimate uncertainty. 3) A relationship-aware diversity sampling strategy to select informative points.Through extensive experiments, the authors are able to validate their hypothesis and achieve 97-99% of the performance of fully supervised models using only 10 annotated points per image. This provides evidence that dense pixel annotation can potentially be replaced by sparse point annotation without loss in model performance.
