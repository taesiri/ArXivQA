# [Can Large Language Models Detect Rumors on Social Media?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) for rumor detection on social media. Rumor detection is challenging because LLMs may not concentrate on key clues in the complex propagation information on social media, and have trouble reasoning when facing massive and redundant information.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an LLM-empowered Rumor Detection (LeRuD) approach. The key ideas are:

1) Design rational and conflicting prompts to teach the LLM to concentrate on important clues like writing styles, commonsense mistakes, rebuttals and conflicts when analyzing news and comments.

2) Divide the propagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation (CoP) to reduce the LLM's burden, by enabling it to conduct reasoning step-by-step with a reasonable number of comments. 

The prompts and CoP aim to guide the LLM to detect rumors from commonsense perspectives instead of relying on its exact factual knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Propose to apply LLMs for rumor detection by modeling both news content and comments
- Design prompts to teach LLMs to concentrate on key clues for reasoning  
- Propose Chain-of-Propagation to reduce LLMs' burden when facing massive comments
- Experiments show LeRuD outperforms state-of-the-art models by 3.2% to 7.7%, and has promising ability in few-shot/zero-shot settings

In summary, the paper explores the power of LLMs for rumor detection on social media, and makes efforts like designing prompts and Chain-of-Propagation to enable LLMs to well detect rumors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called LeRuD that uses large language models with specially designed prompts and chain-of-reasoning to detect rumors in social media posts without needing any training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. Proposing to apply large language models (LLMs) to detect rumors on social media using the entire propagation information, which contains both news contents and comments.

2. Designing proper prompts to teach LLMs to concentrate on key clues in news and comments, enabling LLMs to conduct reasoning from multiple perspectives. 

3. Dividing the propagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation, which allows LLMs to conduct reasoning step-by-step with a reasonable amount of information in each step.

4. Conducting extensive experiments that compare the proposed LLM-empowered Rumor Detection (LeRuD) approach with several state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the superiority of LeRuD. 

5. Showing that with the efforts made in this paper (i.e. the prompts and Chain-of-Propagation), LLMs can well detect rumors on social media.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an approach to empower LLMs to effectively detect rumors on social media by designing prompts and decomposition methods to guide the reasoning process. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) for rumor detection on social media. It proposes an approach called LeRuD which utilizes rational prompts and a Chain-of-Propagation to help the LLM reason over news contents and user comments. The approach is evaluated on Twitter and Weibo datasets and compared against state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong performance.

In summary, the key terms cover: LLMs, rumor detection, reasoning over propagation information, prompts, chain-of-reasoning, and performance evaluation on social media datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions designing proper prompts to teach language models to concentrate on key clues for rumor detection. What considerations went into designing the Rational Prompts and Conflicting Prompts to enable improved reasoning capability?

2. The Chain-of-Propagation (CoP) reasoning process divides the propagation information into steps over time. What was the rationale behind selecting 100 comments per step? Were other step sizes experimented with? 

3. How was the final prediction decision made after going through the multiple CoP reasoning steps? Was there a weighting or aggregation method used across steps?

4. Were other large language models besides GPT-3.5 experimented with? If so, how did their rumor detection capabilities compare? If not, what factors led to only evaluating GPT-3.5?

5. The prompts designed for the language model contain specific instructions intended to guide reasoning, such as considering writing style and commonsense knowledge. How rigidly does the model adhere to these guidelines or does it tend to stray? 

6. For early rumor detection with limited comments, how well does the approach perform compared to models that utilize propagation structure? Are certain types of comments more informative early on?

7. The paper filters out samples where the language model already knows facts that could bias rumor detection. What percentage of samples tended to be filtered and did this differ across datasets?

8. How sensitive is performance based on the specificity of the prompts provided? Would more open-ended prompts lead to different results or types of reasoning chains?

9. Did an error analysis reveal any systematic weaknesses in the modelâ€™s reasoning process or rumorous content that it struggled with reliably detecting?

10. The method does not require training data. How well does it generalize to rumor detection in different domains like health or finance? What adaptations would be needed?
