# [Towards Compositional Adversarial Robustness: Generalizing Adversarial   Training to Composite Semantic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04235)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) How to generalize adversarial training from a single threat model (e.g. $\ell_p$ norm bounded perturbations) to defend against multiple/composite semantic perturbations? 

2) How to optimize the perturbation order when combining multiple semantic and $\ell_p$ norm perturbations into a composite adversarial attack?

3) Can the proposed generalized adversarial training (GAT) approach outperform other adversarial training baselines in defending against composite perturbations?

In particular, the authors propose a novel composite adversarial attack method that can find optimal attack compositions by attack order scheduling and component-wise projected gradient descent. They then propose GAT to train models robust to not only single threats like $\ell_\infty$ perturbations, but also combinations of multiple semantic perturbations like changes in hue, saturation, brightness, etc. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that their proposed GAT approach can achieve state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of single and composite adversarial threats, compared to prior adversarial training methods. The results on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 appear to support this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research questions addressed are: 1) how to achieve compositional robustness via adversarial training, 2) how to optimize composite attacks, and 3) evaluating if the proposed GAT outperforms other adversarial training baselines. The central hypothesis is that GAT can provide robustness against diverse composite adversarial examples.
