# [Towards Compositional Adversarial Robustness: Generalizing Adversarial   Training to Composite Semantic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04235)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) How to generalize adversarial training from a single threat model (e.g. $\ell_p$ norm bounded perturbations) to defend against multiple/composite semantic perturbations? 

2) How to optimize the perturbation order when combining multiple semantic and $\ell_p$ norm perturbations into a composite adversarial attack?

3) Can the proposed generalized adversarial training (GAT) approach outperform other adversarial training baselines in defending against composite perturbations?

In particular, the authors propose a novel composite adversarial attack method that can find optimal attack compositions by attack order scheduling and component-wise projected gradient descent. They then propose GAT to train models robust to not only single threats like $\ell_\infty$ perturbations, but also combinations of multiple semantic perturbations like changes in hue, saturation, brightness, etc. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that their proposed GAT approach can achieve state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of single and composite adversarial threats, compared to prior adversarial training methods. The results on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 appear to support this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research questions addressed are: 1) how to achieve compositional robustness via adversarial training, 2) how to optimize composite attacks, and 3) evaluating if the proposed GAT outperforms other adversarial training baselines. The central hypothesis is that GAT can provide robustness against diverse composite adversarial examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel composite adversarial attack (CAA) method that can generate adversarial examples across multiple perturbation types, including semantic perturbations (e.g. hue, saturation, rotation, etc.) and l_p norm attacks. A key part of CAA is an attack order scheduling algorithm that can find the optimal attack order to maximize the adversarial effect.

2. It proposes a generalized adversarial training (GAT) framework to train models that are robust to composite adversarial attacks. GAT incorporates the proposed CAA method to generate composite adversarial examples during training. 

3. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that models trained with GAT achieve much higher robust accuracy against composite attacks compared to prior adversarial training methods focused on single perturbation types. For example, GAT improves robust accuracy by 30-60% on semantic attacks and 15-22% on full attacks combining semantic and l_inf attacks.

4. Analysis shows the proposed CAA achieves higher attack success rates compared to random attack ordering, demonstrating the effectiveness of the attack order scheduling algorithm. 

In summary, the main contribution is developing novel attacks and defenses to improve robustness against composite/semantic adversarial perturbations, going beyond the typical single perturbation adversarial training. The proposed GAT framework significantly outperforms prior art in defending against a combinational of multiple perturbation types.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called generalized adversarial training (GAT) to improve the robustness of deep learning models against composite adversarial attacks involving multiple perturbation types, such as combinations of semantic and Lp-norm attacks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related research:

- This paper focuses on improving adversarial robustness against multiple perturbation types, including semantic perturbations like changes in hue, saturation, etc. as well as Lp norm perturbations. Many prior works have focused only on robustness against Lp norms like Linfty. Considering multiple perturbation types together is still an open research problem.

- The proposed generalized adversarial training (GAT) method aims to train models that are robust to combinations of different perturbation types. Most prior adversarial training methods target robustness to a single perturbation model like Linfty adversarial examples. Training for robustness against multiple perturbation types is more challenging.

- A key contribution is the composite adversarial attack (CAA) method that can generate adversarial examples across multiple perturbation types and automatically learn good attack combinations. This is different from prior works that usually consider attacks limited to a single perturbation type.

- The paper shows GAT can improve robustness against a wide range of semantic and norm-based attacks both individually and in combinations. Many previous adversarial training methods have struggled to generalize robustness beyond the particular perturbation type they are trained on.

- The attack order scheduling algorithm used in CAA to find optimal sequences of perturbation types is novel. Most prior composite attacks do not explicitly optimize the attack composition.

Overall, this paper pushes research forward in considering more diverse and realistic adversarial threats during training. The results demonstrate improved generalized robustness compared to prior adversarial training methods focused on individual perturbation models like Linfty. The composite attack methodology and generalized adversarial training approach offer promising directions for future research on more comprehensive adversarial robustness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different attack compositions and new threat models beyond the ones studied in this paper. The authors mainly focused on a few semantic perturbations (hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, rotation) plus l-infinity, but there are many other potential semantic or physical threat models that could be incorporated into the composite attack framework.

- Developing more advanced attack scheduling algorithms. The authors propose a basic scheduling approach using relaxed doubly stochastic matrices, but more sophisticated ML-based methods could be developed to learn optimal attack schedules. 

- Generalizing the defense approach to other model architectures and threat models. The authors demonstrate their generalized adversarial training (GAT) on CNNs against the perturbations they considered, but it would be useful to evaluate the effectiveness for other models (e.g. transformers) and attacks.

- Scaling up evaluation to larger and more complex datasets. The authors used ImageNet and CIFAR-10, but testing on higher resolution, more diverse datasets could reveal limitations.

- Considering computational efficiency andMemory overhead during training and attack generation. The proposed methods add complexity, so improving efficiency is important for real-world usage.

- Studying certified or provable robustness to composite perturbations. The empirical defense approach may still have vulnerabilities, so formal verification methods could complement this.

- Analyzing theoretical connections between robustness to single vs. composite perturbations. Further analysis may reveal more fundamental insights about the principles of robustness.

- Developing adaptive, ensemble attack methods. Having attacks that can automatically select and combine perturbations could reveal additional model weaknesses.

Overall, the authors' approach opens up an interesting new direction, and they discuss many worthwhile avenues for extending this line of research on compositional robustness further. Testing new attacks, developing more advanced defenses, scaling up the problem setting, and deeper theoretical analysis seem like particularly promising follow-ons.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called generalized adversarial training (GAT) to improve the robustness of deep neural networks against composite adversarial attacks involving multiple perturbation types. The key ideas are 1) a composite adversarial attack framework that can find optimal attack compositions by optimizing attack order and individual attack components, and 2) incorporating such composite attacks into adversarial training. The composite attack uses a scheduling algorithm to determine the best order of semantic (hue, saturation, etc) and Lp-norm attacks. Each attack component is optimized using projected gradient descent to maximize classification error. GAT trains models on these composite attacks to make them robust. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show GAT models achieve much higher robust accuracy on composite attacks than baselines like standard or Lp-norm adversarial training. The results demonstrate GAT is effective at improving robustness against combinations of multiple realistic perturbation types.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called generalized adversarial training (GAT) to improve the robustness of deep learning models against composite adversarial attacks. The key ideas are 1) a new composite adversarial attack (CAA) that combines multiple perturbation types such as semantic and L_p attacks in an optimal order, and 2) incorporating these composite attacks into adversarial training. The CAA method utilizes component-wise PGD and automatic attack order scheduling to find the best sequence of semantic and L_p attacks. The attack order scheduling is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to identify the sequence that maximizes the loss. The GAT framework then trains models using adversarial examples generated by CAA to improve robustness against composite attacks. 

Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that GAT significantly outperforms existing adversarial training methods against a wide range of individual and composite attacks. For example, on ImageNet, GAT improves robust accuracy over baselines by 30-60% on semantic attacks and 15-22% on combined semantic and L_infty attacks. The results show GAT can maintain high robustness not just to single threat models like L_infty, but also to any combinations of semantic and L_infty perturbations. The visualizations also reveal GAT produces smoother loss landscapes. Overall, this work represents an important advance towards achieving compositional robustness in deep learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called generalized adversarial training (GAT) to improve model robustness against composite adversarial attacks involving multiple perturbation types. GAT consists of two key components: 1) A composite adversarial attack (CAA) method that can generate optimized attacks with different semantic perturbations (e.g. hue, saturation, rotation) and $\ell_p$ norms, leveraging an attack order scheduling algorithm and projected gradient descent optimization of each attack component. 2) Adversarial training using the generated composite adversarial examples from CAA to train neural network models that are robust to various single and combined adversarial threats. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GAT can achieve significantly higher robust accuracy compared to baseline adversarial training methods when evaluated on composite semantic and $\ell_\infty$ attacks. The attack scheduling and per-component optimization in CAA are shown to be critical for producing strong composite adversarial examples during training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main questions it aims to address are:

1. How to generalize adversarial training from a single threat model to multiple? 

The paper notes that most prior adversarial training approaches focus on improving robustness against a single perturbation type, such as those bounded in an Lp norm. However, they argue that robustness against a single threat model may not guarantee robustness against other types of perturbations. So the paper aims to develop a more comprehensive adversarial training approach that can handle multiple perturbation types.

2. How to optimize the perturbation order from a set of semantic and Lp-norm perturbations?

When composing multiple perturbation types, the order in which they are applied affects the effectiveness of the resulting composite adversarial example. The paper proposes an attack order scheduling algorithm to find the optimal ordering that leads to the strongest composite attack.

3. Can the proposed generalized adversarial training (GAT) outperform other adversarial training baselines against composite perturbations?

The paper empirically evaluates GAT against several other adversarial training methods and demonstrates its superior robustness against both single and composite adversarial attacks. This provides evidence that GAT is more effective at achieving robustness across a diverse set of threat models.

In summary, the key focus is on expanding adversarial training to handle multiple perturbation types in combination, rather than just a single threat model, which has been the main emphasis in prior work. The paper's main contributions are the proposed GAT framework, composite attack method, and empirical results demonstrating the benefits of GAT.
