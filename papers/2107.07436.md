# [FastSHAP: Real-Time Shapley Value Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07436)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to develop efficient methods for estimating Shapley values that can scale to large, high-dimensional machine learning models. In particular, the paper proposes a new method called FastSHAP that can estimate Shapley values with high accuracy using a single forward pass through a learned explainer model. The key hypotheses are:1. It is possible to train an explainer model to accurately estimate Shapley values without requiring a large dataset of ground truth Shapley values, by using an objective function derived from the Shapley value's weighted least squares characterization.2. By amortizing the cost of computing Shapley values across many data samples, FastSHAP can provide a significant speedup over existing Shapley value approximation techniques that require multiple model evaluations per sample.3. FastSHAP can generate high-quality explanations for complex models and data like images, where computing exact Shapley values is intractable.The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by evaluating FastSHAP's accuracy, speed, and ability to explain image models relative to baseline Shapley value estimators and gradient-based explanation methods. The key research contributions are developing the training procedure and objective for FastSHAP to enable efficient learning without ground truth Shapley values, and demonstrating its capabilities empirically on tabular and image data.
