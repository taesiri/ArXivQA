## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "StreamingDialogue: Prolonged Dialogue Learning via Long Context Compression with Minimal Losses":

Problem:
- Standard large language models (LLMs) struggle to handle dialogues with long contexts due to efficiency and consistency issues. Attention mechanisms incur quadratic growth in computational complexity with text length, leading to increased memory usage and slowed generation speed.
- Existing methods like sparse attention or memory augmentation have limitations in preserving dialogue history or expanding the context window for prolonged conversations.

Proposed Solution: 
- Identify separator tokens "End-of-Utterance" (EoU) as "conversational attention sinks" (conv-attn sinks) which aggregate utterance information. 
- Propose StreamingDialogue framework to compress lengthy dialogues into conv-attn sinks with minimal losses to improve efficiency. Only cache conv-attn sinks, first token, and recent utterances.
- Devise short-memory reconstruction (SMR) and long-memory reactivation (LMR) strategies to enhance conv-attn sinks' capability to aggregate and reactivate information.

Main Contributions:
- Discover EoU tokens' potential to aggregate utterance information and define them as conv-attn sinks.
- StreamingDialogue handles prolonged dialogues by caching critical tokens only, reducing complexity. 
- SMR and LMR strategies augment model's short and long term memory capabilities regarding information aggregation and extraction.
- Experiments show StreamingDialogue outperforms baselines in metrics, efficiency, inference length capability and long-term memory while maintaining information integrity. Enables prolonged multi-turn conversations.

In summary, StreamingDialogue leverages dialogue structure via conv-attn sinks to achieve efficient and consistent prolonged dialogue learning and generation through targeted caching, information compression and strategic learning.
