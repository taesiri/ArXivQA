# [Rethinking Object Saliency Ranking: A Novel Whole-flow Processing   Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03226)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel paradigm for saliency ranking that addresses three core issues in existing methods: improper ground truth generation, interference from multi-task learning, and complexity of regression techniques. The authors pioneer a relationship-aware saliency ranking ground truth (GT) approach to produce reliable GT orders aligned with human visual perception. They also introduce a flexible single-task classification framework called FOSRNet that leverages off-line proposals and an adaptive circulative bagging method to simplify training and enhance efficiency. Moving from regression to classification reduces reliance on pixel-level masks and extensive data. Together, these contributions form a whole-flow processing paradigm - spanning GT generation, network design, and training protocol - that sets a strong foundation to advance saliency ranking research. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate clear superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, with consistent performance across GT thresholds. By tackling limitations in prevailing techniques through a systematic methodology, this work provides key insights and a robust benchmark for determining relative saliency of objects.
