# [Onion-Peel Networks for Deep Video Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08718)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:How can deep neural networks be effectively applied to the problem of video completion (i.e. filling in missing or unwanted regions in a video sequence) in order to achieve high quality results while remaining efficient?The authors propose a novel "onion-peel" network that progressively fills in missing video regions by referring to content in nearby reference frames. Their method does not rely on optical flow computation like some other techniques, allowing it to handle challenging scenes with occlusion or fast motion that are not easily modeled by flow. The onion-peeling approach allows the network to exploit richer context for filling in missing areas compared to one-shot methods. An asymmetric attention mechanism enables non-local matching between hole and non-hole regions across unlimited spatial and temporal windows.In summary, the key hypothesis seems to be that an iterative onion-peel approach with asymmetric attention can enable deep networks to achieve efficient, high-quality video completion compared to existing optimization or learning based techniques. The experiments aim to validate the quality, efficiency, and flexibility of their proposed method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel deep network architecture called Onion-Peel Networks for video completion. The key aspects are:- It uses an "onion peeling" approach to progressively fill in missing regions in a video frame by frame, enabling it to handle even large holes successfully. - It proposes an asymmetric attention block to match hole boundary pixels in the target frame with non-hole pixels in reference frames to retrieve proper contents. This allows exploiting richer contextual information from reference frames.- The attention mechanism provides an unlimited spatial-temporal window for retrieving contents, without relying on optical flow computation. This makes it robust in cases where flow estimation is difficult.- The method can be applied to both video completion as well as image completion using reference images, without modification.- It achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art optimization methods for video completion, while being much faster. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness.In summary, the main contribution is the novel deep network architecture for flow-free video/image completion that exploits spatial-temporal attention over reference frames to achieve high-quality hole filling. The onion-peeling approach also enables handling large holes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This paper proposes a deep learning framework called Onion-Peel Networks for video completion, which progressively fills in missing regions in a video by referring to content in other frames using an attention mechanism.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of video completion:- The main contribution is proposing a deep learning approach called the Onion-Peel Network for video completion. This is in contrast to previous optimization-based methods like Huang et al. and other learning-based methods like VINet.  - The Onion-Peel Network fills in holes in a video frame by gradually eroding the hole from the boundary inwards. This allows it to exploit richer context compared to methods that fill the entire hole in one pass.- It uses an asymmetric attention mechanism to match hole boundary pixels to visible pixels in reference frames. This allows an unlimited spatial-temporal window for retrieving content, unlike prior learning methods with limited receptive fields.- It achieves comparable quality to the state-of-the-art optimization method of Huang et al. but is over 50x faster since it is deep learning based.- The approach works for both video completion and image completion tasks by using reference frames. Most prior video completion methods are not easily adaptable to the image completion task.- One limitation is that it may produce flickering artifacts in videos, requiring a post-processing step for temporal consistency. The optimization methods may handle consistency better.Overall, this paper presents a novel deep learning approach for flow-free video completion that achieves strong results compared to prior optimization and learning techniques. The onion-peel idea and asymmetric attention mechanism are innovative ways to achieve globally coherent completion from an unlimited spatio-temporal window.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the conclusion section:- They mention exploring temporal coherency in the framework for video completion as a potential avenue for future work. They indicate encoding temporal consistency directly in the network could be beneficial.- They suggest exploring the application of the approach to other tasks such as video stylization or animation. The attention mechanism and onion peeling approach may be useful in those domains as well.- They propose investigating adaptive schemes for things like the peel width and number of recursions. Allowing those to vary based on the hole size/characteristics could improve results.- They mention the post-processing step for temporal consistency has some limitations like blurring. Improving this step to stabilize videos while retaining sharpness could be valuable.- They suggest evaluating the approach on higher resolution videos is an area for future work.So in summary, the main future directions mentioned are: exploring temporal coherency in the framework itself, applying the approach to other tasks like stylization, improving the post-processing step, evaluating on higher resolution videos, and investigating adaptive schemes for things like peel widths. The core areas seem to be around video-specific enhancements and applications to other tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an onion-peel network for video completion. The method takes a target image with holes and reference images as input. It fills in the holes in the target image by retrieving content from the reference images. The network progressively fills in the hole region starting from the boundary, peeling layers like an onion. This allows it to exploit richer contextual information at each step. An asymmetric attention block is used to match features between the target and references to locate relevant content for filling holes. This attention mechanism allows the network to have an unlimited spatial-temporal window for retrieving content. The method can do both image completion using reference images and video completion. For video, frames are sampled as references to fill holes in a target frame. Experiments show the approach produces results comparable to state-of-the-art optimization methods but much faster. It also outperforms learning methods with limited receptive fields. The onion peeling enables handling large holes. Overall, the method enables high quality, efficient video and image completion.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel deep network called Onion-Peel Network (OPN) for video completion. Given a set of reference frames and a target frame with holes, the network fills in the holes by referring to content in the reference frames. The onion-peel network progressively fills in the hole from the boundary inwards, allowing it to exploit richer contextual information at each step. This enables it to handle even large holes successfully after sufficient recurrences. To attend to missing information visible in the references, an asymmetric attention block is proposed that computes similarities between hole boundary pixels in the target and non-hole pixels in references in a non-local manner. This allows the network to have an unlimited spatio-temporal window and fill holes with globally coherent content, without needing to compute optical flow. The framework can also be used for image completion guided by reference images without modification, unlike previous methods. Experiments validate the method produces visually pleasing results for both image and video completion.In summary, the key points are:- Proposes onion-peel network for video completion that progressively fills holes by eroding hole boundary.- Uses asymmetric attention to match hole pixels to references for unlimited spatio-temporal window.  - Achieves state-of-the-art quality at fast speed and handles cases where flow is challenging.- Also applicable to image completion guided by references without modification.- Produces visually pleasing results for both image and video completion.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method used in this paper is an onion-peel network for video completion. The key ideas are:- The network fills in missing regions in a video frame by frame. For each frame, it progressively fills in the hole from the boundary inwards, peeling away layers like an onion. This allows it to exploit richer contextual information at each step. - It uses an asymmetric attention block to match pixels in the hole boundary (peel) region to valid pixels in reference frames. This allows retrieving missing content from reference frames in a non-local manner, without relying on optical flow. - The network is trained on synthesized data with holes, using a combination of pixel reconstruction loss and perceptual losses. The onion peeling allows it to handle large holes.- At inference, it can do image completion using reference images or video completion by looping over frames. For video, it samples reference frames sparsely.- A post-processing step is added to improve temporal coherence in videos.In summary, the core idea is the onion-peel architecture with asymmetric attention to match hole pixels to reference frames, enabling flow-free video completion with large spatial-temporal receptive fields.
