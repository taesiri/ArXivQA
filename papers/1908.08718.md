# Onion-Peel Networks for Deep Video Completion

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:How can deep neural networks be effectively applied to the problem of video completion (i.e. filling in missing or unwanted regions in a video sequence) in order to achieve high quality results while remaining efficient?The authors propose a novel "onion-peel" network that progressively fills in missing video regions by referring to content in nearby reference frames. Their method does not rely on optical flow computation like some other techniques, allowing it to handle challenging scenes with occlusion or fast motion that are not easily modeled by flow. The onion-peeling approach allows the network to exploit richer context for filling in missing areas compared to one-shot methods. An asymmetric attention mechanism enables non-local matching between hole and non-hole regions across unlimited spatial and temporal windows.In summary, the key hypothesis seems to be that an iterative onion-peel approach with asymmetric attention can enable deep networks to achieve efficient, high-quality video completion compared to existing optimization or learning based techniques. The experiments aim to validate the quality, efficiency, and flexibility of their proposed method.
