# [FreeControl: Training-Free Spatial Control of Any Text-to-Image   Diffusion Model with Any Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07536)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed high-level summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper presents FreeControl, a novel training-free approach for spatially controlling text-to-image (T2I) generation using pretrained diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. The key innovation is using principal component analysis (PCA) on the internal self-attention features of the diffusion model to obtain a consistent semantic structure representation across diverse modalities. This representation, along with structure and appearance guidance, enables aligning the generated image with a guidance image while preserving fidelity to the text prompt. FreeControl supports diverse control signals like sketches, depth maps, human poses etc. and multiple model architectures and checkpoints without any modifications. Experiments demonstrate it escapes the appearance leakage issue in other training-free methods, provides strong controllability relative to baselines, and balances spatial alignment and text-fidelity better than training-based methods like ControlNet. FreeControl generalizes to text-guided image-to-image translation as well. Overall, it offers a scalable training-free solution for steerable generation of visual content while retaining model expressivity, without constraints on control signals or model customization needs.
