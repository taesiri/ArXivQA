# [The Effectiveness of Random Forgetting for Robust Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - small intentional perturbations to inputs that cause erroneous predictions. Adversarial training (AT) trains models on adversarial examples to improve robustness. However, AT suffers from "robust overfitting", where test robustness decreases with prolonged training despite increasing train robustness. This hinders generalization. Conventional regularization methods fail to mitigate this phenomenon.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "Forget to Mitigate Overfitting (FOMO)", a new AT paradigm inspired by active forgetting in the human brain. FOMO alternates between:

1) Forgetting Phase: Randomly resets a subset of weights in later layers to partially "forget" overfitted information and regulate model capacity.

2) Relearning Phase: Interleaved adversarial training to relearn generalizable patterns.

3) Consolidation Phase: Exponentially averages model weights into a "stable" model to consolidate generalized knowledge across relearning phases.  

The cyclic process interacts forgetting, relearning and consolidation to achieve robust generalization in AT.

Key Contributions:

- FOMO significantly reduces robust overfitting - improving robust test accuracy and lowering gap between best and final test performance.

- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets and architectures. More resilient to natural corruptions and perturbation attacks.

- Robust to AutoAttack, demonstrating real-world effectiveness. Generalizes better on larger datasets like TinyImagenet.

- Converges to flatter minima, evident from higher resilience to Gaussian noise in weights.

- Computationally efficient as forgetting through weight resets adds negligible overhead.

In summary, FOMO provides a promising solution for alleviating robust overfitting in AT by emulating active forgetting to improve generalization, leading to enhanced robustness. The alternating phases regulate model capacity and consolidate robust patterns to mitigate overfitting.
