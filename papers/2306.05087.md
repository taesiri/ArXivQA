# [PandaLM: An Automatic Evaluation Benchmark for LLM Instruction Tuning   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05087)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:Can an automatic, robust, and reliable evaluation benchmark be developed to facilitate hyperparameter optimization for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs)?The authors propose a judge LLM called PandaLM to address the need for such an evaluation benchmark. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) PandaLM can accurately evaluate and compare the performance of different instruction-tuned LLMs in order to identify optimal hyperparameters. 2) Models tuned using PandaLM's selected hyperparameters will demonstrate improved performance compared to models tuned with default hyperparameters.3) PandaLM provides advantages over human evaluation or commercial LLMs in terms of cost, efficiency, privacy protection, and open access.The paper seems focused on introducing PandaLM and experimentally validating that it can effectively optimize hyperparameters for instruction tuning, outperforming default tuning methods while avoiding the limitations of other evaluation approaches. Developing an automatic evaluation benchmark is positioned as the main gap being addressed.In summary, the central hypothesis is that PandaLM enables robust, low-cost hyperparameter optimization for instruction tuning LLMs through automatic and reliable model evaluation. The paper aims to introduce and validate this approach as superior to alternatives.
