# [Controllable Human-Object Interaction Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the problem of synthesizing continuous human-object interaction motions in 3D environments from natural language commands. The task involves generating synchronized motions of a human and an object, grounded in the 3D scene context. It is challenging because the motions need to (1) follow the directives in the language command, (2) maintain realistic contact between human and object as well as with the environment, (3) accommodate constraints from the cluttered 3D scene. Prior works are limited in handling larger objects or generating interactions solely from initial states. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes CHOIS, an approach that utilizes a conditional diffusion model to generate object motion and human motion simultaneously. The model conditions on language embeddings, initial object and human states, and sparse object waypoints extracted from the 3D scene. To align the generated object motion with input object waypoints, an additional object geometry loss is incorporated during training. Moreover, to ensure realistic contacts in the results, guidance terms related to hand-object contact, feet-floor contact, and object-floor penetration are designed and applied to perturb the sampling process.

Main Contributions:
1) Identifies that language commands combined with sparse object waypoints, which can be obtained from high-level planning methods, provide effective grounding for interaction synthesis in 3D scenes.

2) Proposes a conditional diffusion model that generates synchronized object and human motions guided by language and sparse waypoints. Achieves state-of-the-art performance.

3) Integrates guidance terms during sampling to enhance contact realism without expensive losses during training. Ablations validate their effectiveness.  

4) Demonstrates an application that leverages the proposed interaction synthesis module to generate long-horizon human-object interactions conditioned on language input and 3D scenes.
