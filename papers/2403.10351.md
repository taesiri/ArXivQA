# [TriSum: Learning Summarization Ability from Large Language Models with   Structured Rationale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10351)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown great performance on text summarization. However, their massive size limits widespread deployment and raises privacy concerns when sending data to external services. There is a need for compact local models that can distill the summarization abilities of LLMs while enhancing interpretability.

Method - TriSum:
The paper proposes TriSum, a 3-step framework to transfer summarization skills from LLMs to small models:

1. LLM Rationale Probing: Use the LLM to extract "aspect-triple" rationales - key aspects, relational triples and summaries tied to them, through prompting over multiple iterations.

2. Golden Rationale Selection: Select high-quality rationales using a scoring method based on summary semantic similarity and topic coherence.

3. Curriculum Learning: Progressively train the small model on tasks ranging from aspect extraction to joint rationale-summary generation, evolving from simple to complex objectives.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a novel distillation approach to transfer LLM's summarization abilities to compact local models with enhanced transparency through rationales.
- Designs a scoring mechanism for choosing high-quality rationales to supervise local model training.  
- Demonstrates superior performance over SOTA models on CNN/DailyMail (+4.5% ROUGE), XSum (+8.5% ROUGE) and a clinical trial dataset (+7.4% ROUGE).
- Enhances model interpretability by generating and analyzing rationales that offer insights into LLM summarization processes.

In summary, the paper enables streamlined and transparent summarization models for resource-constrained settings by strategically distilling and transferring inherent skills of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces TriSum, a novel 3-step framework to distill large language models' text summarization abilities into compact local models by extracting aspect-triple rationales from the LLM, selecting high-quality rationales, and training the local model using curriculum learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing TriSum, a novel framework for distilling the text summarization abilities of large language models (LLMs) into compact, local models. Specifically:

1) TriSum probes LLMs to generate aspect-triple rationales (key aspects, relevant triples, summaries tied to them) from input texts. 

2) It employs a dual scoring method to select high-quality rationales from the LLM to use for training.

3) It trains a small local model using these rationales, employing a curriculum learning strategy that evolves from simple to complex summarization tasks. 

Through experiments, the paper shows TriSum can enhance local model performance on CNN/DailyMail, XSum, and ClinicalTrial benchmarks, outperforming baselines. It also improves interpretability by providing insights into the models' summarization rationale.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the proposed TriSum method transfer summarization abilities from a large language model (LLM) to a small local model? What are the key steps it follows to achieve this transfer?

2. What is the rationale probing step in TriSum and how does it elicit aspect-triple rationales from the LLM? How do the extracted aspects and triples provide transparency into the LLM's summarization process?  

3. Explain the dual scoring method used for selecting high-quality, "golden" rationales in TriSum. How do the summary score and LDA-based coherence score ensure coherent and relevant rationales?

4. Discuss the curriculum learning strategy utilized to train the small local model in TriSum. Why is singular-task learning useful initially? How does concurrent and joint learning build on this?  

5. How does providing LLM-generated rationales as additional supervision in TriSum help improve the local model's summarization performance? What role does the golden rationale selection play?

6. Analyze and compare the summaries created by TriSum and baseline models like BART qualitatively through case studies. How does TriSum's explicit rationale aid interpretability? 

7. What hyperparameter tuning was performed for components of TriSum like golden rationale selection and rationale-summary generation? How were optimal values determined experimentally?  

8. How robust is TriSum across diverse datasets like news articles, extreme summaries, and clinical trials? Does it consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines?

9. What limitations remain in extracting rationales from LLMs? Could biases or flaws in the LLM negatively impact the local model trained using TriSum?

10. How can the aspect-triple rationale approach proposed in TriSum be extended to other language generation tasks beyond summarization for enhanced transparency?
