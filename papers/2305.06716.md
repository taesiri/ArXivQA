# [Distracting Downpour: Adversarial Weather Attacks for Motion Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06716)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- Can naturally occurring weather effects like snow, rain, or fog be manipulated to serve as adversarial examples that fool motion estimation methods?

- Will adversarial weather attacks that respect the 3D geometry and temporal consistency of scenes be more effective at fooling motion estimation compared to existing 2D adversarial attacks? 

- Are motion estimation methods that show good robustness to small per-pixel perturbations also robust to adversarial weather effects?

- Can augmenting training data with non-adversarial weather effects increase robustness to both weather and adversarial weather attacks?

The central hypothesis seems to be that adversarial weather attacks that mimic realistic weather conditions in a 3D and temporally consistent manner will be able to significantly degrade optical flow predictions, even for methods that are robust to other types of adversarial perturbations. The paper also hypothesizes that training with realistic weather data can increase robustness.

To test these hypotheses, the paper proposes a differentiable particle rendering framework to generate adversarial rain, snow, fog etc. that obeys 3D geometry and motion consistency. It then evaluates several optical flow methods on these adversarial weather examples and also trains a model with augmented weather data. The key findings appear to confirm the hypotheses about the effectiveness of realistic adversarial weather and the benefits of weather data augmentation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A differentiable particle-to-scene rendering framework for generating realistic moving particles like rain, snow, fog, etc. in 3D scenes over multiple time steps. This allows adversarial optimization of the particles.

2. Adversarial weather attacks on optical flow using the particle rendering framework. The attacks optimize particle motion and appearance to degrade optical flow predictions, while still maintaining realistic weather effects. 

3. Analysis showing high-quality optical flow methods are more robust to these non-Lp adversarial weather attacks, compared to their vulnerability to Lp attacks.

4. Demonstrating that augmenting training with random (non-adversarial) weather improves robustness to weather effects and generalizability, without much additional cost.

In summary, the key novelty is the differentiable weather rendering for adversarial attacks on optical flow, evaluating robustness in a more natural threat model compared to existing Lp attacks. The findings also suggest random weather augmentation as a cheap way to improve robustness.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a comparison to other related research:

- The paper presents a novel adversarial attack method for optical flow by manipulating simulated weather effects like fog, rain, and snow. This is a new type of attack compared to previous work on adversarial attacks for optical flow, which focused on small per-pixel perturbations or adversarial patches. The weather attack is more realistic and constrained to plausible 3D motion and appearance.

- The differentiable rendering framework for inserting simulated weather particles into a scene is also novel. Previous work on rendering weather effects for augmentation purposes used classical non-differentiable rendering. The differentiable rendering enables adversarial optimization of the weather parameters.

- The finding that methods robust to Lp norm attacks can be more vulnerable to weather attacks is interesting. It suggests robustness to different perturbation types may not be strongly correlated.

- Training with random (non-adversarial) weather augmentation improves robustness to weather effects more than adversarial training helps for Lp norm attacks. This could be a useful robustness technique.

- Overall, the weather attacks seem more realistic than previous adversarial attacks on optical flow. The constraints like 3D motion, temporal consistency, and realistic appearance help achieve this. The work is still limited to attacking optical flow instead of real systems.

In summary, this paper introduces more realistic adversarial attacks on optical flow using novel differentiable weather rendering. The results provide new insights into robustness against different perturbation types. The work helps better evaluate optical flow methods for real-world conditions.
