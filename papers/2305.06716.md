# [Distracting Downpour: Adversarial Weather Attacks for Motion Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06716)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

- Can naturally occurring weather effects like snow, rain, or fog be manipulated to serve as adversarial examples that fool motion estimation methods?

- Will adversarial weather attacks that respect the 3D geometry and temporal consistency of scenes be more effective at fooling motion estimation compared to existing 2D adversarial attacks? 

- Are motion estimation methods that show good robustness to small per-pixel perturbations also robust to adversarial weather effects?

- Can augmenting training data with non-adversarial weather effects increase robustness to both weather and adversarial weather attacks?

The central hypothesis seems to be that adversarial weather attacks that mimic realistic weather conditions in a 3D and temporally consistent manner will be able to significantly degrade optical flow predictions, even for methods that are robust to other types of adversarial perturbations. The paper also hypothesizes that training with realistic weather data can increase robustness.

To test these hypotheses, the paper proposes a differentiable particle rendering framework to generate adversarial rain, snow, fog etc. that obeys 3D geometry and motion consistency. It then evaluates several optical flow methods on these adversarial weather examples and also trains a model with augmented weather data. The key findings appear to confirm the hypotheses about the effectiveness of realistic adversarial weather and the benefits of weather data augmentation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A differentiable particle-to-scene rendering framework for generating realistic moving particles like rain, snow, fog, etc. in 3D scenes over multiple time steps. This allows adversarial optimization of the particles.

2. Adversarial weather attacks on optical flow using the particle rendering framework. The attacks optimize particle motion and appearance to degrade optical flow predictions, while still maintaining realistic weather effects. 

3. Analysis showing high-quality optical flow methods are more robust to these non-Lp adversarial weather attacks, compared to their vulnerability to Lp attacks.

4. Demonstrating that augmenting training with random (non-adversarial) weather improves robustness to weather effects and generalizability, without much additional cost.

In summary, the key novelty is the differentiable weather rendering for adversarial attacks on optical flow, evaluating robustness in a more natural threat model compared to existing Lp attacks. The findings also suggest random weather augmentation as a cheap way to improve robustness.
