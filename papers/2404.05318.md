## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling online learning algorithms to be effectively deployed on cyber-physical systems and robots. Such systems have continuous state and action spaces, complex and often unknown dynamics, and only partial state observability. Standard online learning algorithms rely on assumptions like function convexity that are not satisfied in this domain. Additionally, they require gradient information that is very difficult to obtain accurately for cyber-physical systems.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel gradient-based online learning framework that encompasses both gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. It incorporates approximate gradients as prior knowledge to guide the learning process. Convergence guarantees are provided that rely only on smoothness assumptions, avoiding convexity requirements. The impact of gradient estimation errors is quantitatively characterized to ensure applicability to real systems. The algorithm is connected to cyber-physical systems through a two-degrees-of-freedom (feedback plus feedforward) control formulation. Both open loop and closed loop update schemes are derived.

Main Contributions:
- A gradient-based online learning algorithm that allows switching between GD and quasi-Newton methods. Convergence is proven without convexity assumptions.

- Quantitative analysis of the algorithm's robustness to gradient modeling errors. The modeling error modulus Îº is introduced to characterize the estimation quality.

- Formulation enabling direct deployment of the algorithm on cyber-physical systems through a two degrees-of-freedom control architecture. Update rules are derived for both feedforward and feedback control.

- Evaluations on a flexible beam system, a quadruped robot, and a real pneumatic robot arm for playing table tennis. The experiments demonstrate fast convergence, robustness to poor gradient estimates, and applicability to complex nonlinear systems.

In summary, the paper presents an online learning framework that can leverage approximate gradient information to achieve fast, robust learning on real-world cyber-physical systems despite lack of convexity and gradient accuracy. Both theoretical and practical effectiveness is demonstrated.
