# [LitSim: Conflict-aware Policy for Long-term Interactive Traffic   Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing traffic simulators like SUMO and CARLA rely on log replay or simple heuristic models which leads to unrealistic collisions or lack complex interactions between agents. 
- Some learning-based methods encourage interactions but deviate from real-world data over long horizons due to error accumulation.
- Fragmented real-world driving datasets also make long-term simulation challenging.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes LitSim, a long-term interactive traffic simulation method to maximize realism while avoiding unrealistic collisions. 
- LitSim replays logs for most scenarios but intervenes to take over agents when it predicts unrealistic conflicts using a joint motion prediction model.  
- A conflict-aware policy is used to guide taken over agents to encourage interactions while resolving conflicts and reducing likelihood of collisions.
- Once conflicts are resolved, control is switched back to log replay.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes LitSim method combining log replay, joint motion prediction and conflict-aware policy for long-term interactive simulation.
- Identifies potential unrealistic conflicts by predicting future motions of agents jointly.
- Trains a behavior policy from real-world data to take over agents while encouraging interactions. 
- Implemented on SUMO and evaluates on NGSIM dataset, showing improved realism and reactivity over baselines.
- Greatly reduces unrealistic collisions while maintaining scenario realism.

In summary, the key idea is to minimize interventions in log replay through joint motion prediction and only take over agents briefly using a specially trained policy to resolve conflicts, thereby improving realism and reactivity for long-term interactive traffic simulation.
