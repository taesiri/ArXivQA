# [Can LLMs Speak For Diverse People? Tuning LLMs via Debate to Generate   Controllable Controversial Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) lack sufficient controllability to generate statements supporting diverse or controversial perspectives when prompted by users. They tend to produce inconsistent, neutral or biased statements instead.
- Existing methods try to align LLMs to an averaged, majority-endorsed viewpoint, overlooking diversity of opinions fundamental to society. This restricts the potential breadth of LLM responses on controversial topics.
- LLMs should help people with diverse views express opinions to create an inclusive environment. But they currently lack capability to strictly adhere to given stances and remove potential bias.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use a debate mechanism between two LLMs to generate higher-quality, more salient statements supporting arguments on controversial topics. 
- Develop a novel "Debate & Tuning" pipeline called DEBATunE finetuning LLMs using statements obtained from debate to improve stance controllability.
- Curate a large dataset of 710 debate topics covering controversial issues with arguments for positive and negative stances.

Key Contributions:
- A new debate pipeline strengthening opposing statements on controversies instead of reaching consensus, using them to tune LLM's capability to express diverse perspectives.
- Largest debate topic dataset so far with clear distinction of stances.
- A new metric assessing LLM's controllability on controversial topics.
- First evaluation of open-sourced LLMs on debate topics, analyzing strengths and weaknesses.
- Show DEBATunE significantly improves controllability to generate high-quality statements adhering to given stances, even on unseen topics.
