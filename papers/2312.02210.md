# [Low-Precision Mixed-Computation Models for Inference on Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices is challenging due to their large size and high complexity. 
- Using low-precision quantization (e.g. 4-bit) can enable efficient deployment but causes significant accuracy drops.
- Existing number systems like fixed-point (FixP) and floating point struggle at very low precisions. Posit number system has benefits but incurs high computational costs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a mixed-computation approach that combines the strengths of 4-bit Posit and 4-bit FixP number systems.
- Use Posit to represent weights that are more sensitive to quantization errors, since Posit offers better precision near zero.
- Use FixP for other weights to limit computational overhead of Posit.
- Present a sensitivity analysis heuristic to determine which weights should use Posit vs FixP. 
- Introduce approximate gradient for Posit in backpropagation to enable training.
- Propose efficient Posit/FixP hardware design for multiply-accumulate operation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework for developing low-precision mixed-computation neural network models for edge devices.
- Specialized training methodology using customized backpropagation and gradient approximation for Posit parameters.
- Sensitivity analysis technique to assign appropriate number representation to different parameters.  
- Efficient hardware implementation of mixed Posit/FixP multiply-accumulate unit.
- Extensive evaluations showing accuracy improvements of mixed-computation over FixP across vision and language models, with minimal overhead.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative approach to combine the strengths of Posit and FixP in one system to enable higher compression rates and efficient deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a mixed-computation approach for neural network processing on edge devices that strategically uses 4-bit Posit and 4-bit fixed-point number systems to represent different parts of the model, achieving higher accuracy than fixed-point alone with minimal energy overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a mixed-computation neural network processing approach that incorporates both low-precision Posit and low-precision fixed-point number systems. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Introducing a framework for developing low-precision mixed-computation models for edge applications. This framework strategically uses 4-bit Posit to represent sensitive weights and 4-bit fixed-point for other weights.

2) Presenting a training methodology involving a customized backpropagation algorithm to update parameters in Posit layers. 

3) Proposing an efficient hardware implementation of a 4-bit Posit/fixed-point multiply-accumulator (MAC) unit.

4) Evaluating the proposed mixed-computation approach on various vision and language models. Results show the accuracy is improved by about 1.5% on average compared to fixed-point only, with small 0.19% energy overhead.

In summary, the main contribution is the idea of a mixed Posit/fixed-point computation strategy to balance accuracy and hardware efficiency for low-precision neural network inference on resource-constrained edge devices. The paper demonstrates this approach can outperform fixed-point alone with reasonable overhead.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Mixed-computation: Refers to the proposed approach of using a combination of low-precision Posit and low-precision fixed-point number systems to represent the weights in a neural network model. This aims to leverage the benefits of both systems.

- Posit: The Posit number system that offers higher dynamic range and more precision around zero compared to fixed-point. The paper uses 4-bit Posit specifically.

- Fixed-point: The standard fixed-point number representation with uniform precision. The paper uses 4-bit fixed-point.  

- Quantization: The process of reducing the bit-width of weights and activations in a neural network model. This is done to enable low-precision computation.

- Sensitivity analysis: The method proposed to determine which layers would benefit more from Posit quantization vs fixed-point. 

- Backpropagation: The training process, specifically the weight update phase. A gradient approximation method is introduced for Posit weights.

- Edge applications: Resource-constrained edge devices are the target deployment for the proposed mixed-computation approach.

- Energy efficiency: A key motivation is to improve computational efficiency and reduce energy consumption for edge devices.

In summary, the key focus is on a mixed Posit/fixed-point framework to balance accuracy and hardware efficiency for low-precision deep learning on edge.
