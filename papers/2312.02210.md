# [Low-Precision Mixed-Computation Models for Inference on Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices is challenging due to their large size and high complexity. 
- Using low-precision quantization (e.g. 4-bit) can enable efficient deployment but causes significant accuracy drops.
- Existing number systems like fixed-point (FixP) and floating point struggle at very low precisions. Posit number system has benefits but incurs high computational costs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a mixed-computation approach that combines the strengths of 4-bit Posit and 4-bit FixP number systems.
- Use Posit to represent weights that are more sensitive to quantization errors, since Posit offers better precision near zero.
- Use FixP for other weights to limit computational overhead of Posit.
- Present a sensitivity analysis heuristic to determine which weights should use Posit vs FixP. 
- Introduce approximate gradient for Posit in backpropagation to enable training.
- Propose efficient Posit/FixP hardware design for multiply-accumulate operation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework for developing low-precision mixed-computation neural network models for edge devices.
- Specialized training methodology using customized backpropagation and gradient approximation for Posit parameters.
- Sensitivity analysis technique to assign appropriate number representation to different parameters.  
- Efficient hardware implementation of mixed Posit/FixP multiply-accumulate unit.
- Extensive evaluations showing accuracy improvements of mixed-computation over FixP across vision and language models, with minimal overhead.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative approach to combine the strengths of Posit and FixP in one system to enable higher compression rates and efficient deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices.
