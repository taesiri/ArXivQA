# [StoryGPT-V: Large Language Models as Consistent Story Visualizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing story visualization methods struggle with generating accurate and consistent characters across a sequence of frames based on co-referential text descriptions (e.g. using pronouns like "he", "she", "they"). This is due to the inability to effectively resolve ambiguous references in the descriptions and ensure coherence.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes StoryGPT-V, a two-stage method that utilizes the strengths of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for high-quality image generation and Large Language Models (LLMs) for coherent language modeling and reasoning.

In the first stage, the method enhances the LDM by fusing visual features of characters with text embeddings as conditional inputs. It also uses character segmentation masks to refine cross-attention maps, improving character generation accuracy. 

In the second stage, an LLM takes interleaved images and text as input, allowing it to implicitly resolve ambiguous references using context. Its output tokens are aligned with the augmented input space of the LDM using a learned mapping, providing visual features for consistent character generation.

Main Contributions:

- Enhances LDM with character-aware input representations and cross-attention control for precise character generation

- Leverages reasoning and context modeling capacity of LLMs for reference resolution by aligning LLM output with LDM input space  

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating accurate and consistent characters across frames based on co-referential descriptions

- Efficiently retains context as token embeddings compared to pixel-space methods, allowing visualization of longer stories

- First model capable of jointly generating coherent language and corresponding visuals for story continuation/expansion

In summary, the key innovation is effectively combining LDMs and LLMs to harness their complementary strengths for the challenging task of consistent story visualization from ambiguous language descriptions.
