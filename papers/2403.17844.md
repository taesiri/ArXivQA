# [Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17844)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing new deep learning architectures is challenging due to the vast design space, long prototyping times, and high costs of training and evaluating models. 
- Most models rely on the standard Transformer architecture, rather than exploring other arrangements of computational primitives.

Proposed Solution - Mechanistic Architecture Design (MAD):
- Introduce a methodology to streamline architecture design through small-scale "unit tests" on synthetic tasks like compression and recall. These tasks test key capabilities and provide quick performance estimates predictive of scaling laws.
- Design hybrid architectures that combine different computational primitives (like attention, convolutions, recurrences) in an optimal topology to leverage their specialized capabilities.

Key Contributions:
- Propose MAD framework with suite of synthetic tasks to evaluate architectures. Use this to identify improved hybrid designs.
- Conduct extensive analysis on scaling laws, training over 500 language models from 70M to 7B parameters to validate MAD framework and architectures. 
- Find optimal hybridization ratios and topologies for mixing different primitives. Introduce state-optimal scaling analysis.
- Show MAD task scores correlate with compute-optimal perplexity at scale. Enables faster architecture iteration.
- New state-of-the-art architectures designed via MAD outperform Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent baselines by up to 20% in perplexity.

In summary, the paper presents a methodology to accelerate architecture design using small-scale unit tests, identifies optimal ways to combine different primitives into hybrid models, executes large-scale analysis to validate the approach, and demonstrates improved perplexity compared to existing architectures.
