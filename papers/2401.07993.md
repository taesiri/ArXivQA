# [Carrying over algorithm in transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies how transformer models implement the carrying over algorithm for integer addition. The carrying over algorithm consists of two main tasks: 1) adding digits at each position of two integers, and 2) carrying over a digit (typically 1) to the next position whenever the sum at the current position is greater than or equal to 10. The authors aim to understand how different parts of small transformer models contribute to these two tasks.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. For two-layer encoder-only models, the paper shows that each step of the carrying over algorithm is implemented in a modular way by different components of the architecture:
- Layer 1 adds digits at each position. 
- Layer 2 first decides in the attention blocks whether carry over is needed at each position. Then the final MLP performs the actual carry over by adding 1's wherever needed.

2. The same modular implementation was found in three-layer models and small decoder-only models.

3. For large language models - Alpaca 7B, Llemma 7B and Zephyr 7B - the paper provides suggestive evidence that aspects of the modular carrying over implementation also exist. Key evidence includes finding "staircase" attention patterns and transformations in the residual stream similar to the small models.

4. The paper shows the implementation of the carrying over algorithm for 3-digit numbers generalizes to longer numbers after "priming" with a small set of longer addition examples during training. Finetuning also achieves similar generalization.

5. The paper identifies interesting structures in the hidden representations, such as periodic pentagon arrangements of output digits in the residual stream.

6. The evolution of the final MLP during training reveals it gradually develops the capability of carrying digits, measurable by the accuracy on carry vs non-carry tasks over time.

In summary, the paper provides a detailed analysis of how transformer models modularly implement the integer carrying over algorithm, and shows the generalizability of these implementations to larger models and longer numbers. The analysis also reveals interesting properties of the hidden representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies how transformer models implement the carrying over algorithm for integer addition, finding that small encoder-only models allocate the steps of adding digits and carrying over ones to different parts of the network in a modular fashion, and provides evidence that some aspects of this implementation also occur in large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is an analysis of how small transformer models implement the carrying over algorithm for integer addition. Specifically:

1) For two-layer encoder-only models, the paper shows that each step of the carrying over algorithm is implemented in a modular fashion by different parts of the architecture. The first layer adds digits in the same position, the second layer attention determines where a carried one is needed, and the second layer MLP performs the actual carrying over.

2) The paper provides evidence that some of these findings for small models also apply to large language models like Alpaca, Llemma, and Zephyr after fine-tuning on integer addition. Specifically, the presence of "staircase" attention patterns and separation in the residual stream related to carrying over. 

3) The paper shows that the implementation of the carrying over algorithm for 3-digit numbers generalizes to longer integers through priming or finetuning, rather than requiring full retraining. The tiny priming set allows the model to stabilize and generalize the structures already developed for 3-digit addition.

4) The paper identifies a phase transition in one-layer models where the attention blocks suddenly become adders, implementing the first step of the carrying over algorithm.

In summary, the main contribution is a detailed analysis of how transformers of varying sizes implement the integer carrying over algorithm in a modular and generalizable way.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Carrying over algorithm - The algorithm for integer addition that involves adding digits position-by-position and carrying over any values greater than 10 to the next position. The paper analyzes how this algorithm is implemented in transformers.

- Modular implementation - The paper shows that in two-layer encoder-only transformers, each step of the carrying over algorithm is implemented in a parallel, modular fashion by different components of the architecture. 

- Attention patterns - The "staircase" patterns in the self-attention that allow transfer of information between digits to enable addition.

- Residual stream - Studying the representations flowing through the network by doing PCA reveals insights into how examples are grouped and processed. 

- Decision head - An attention head that helps decide whether a carried one needs to be added at a position or not. 

- Final MLP - Shown to be responsible for actually adding any carried ones. 

- Dissection - Identifying the specific neurons responsible for carrying over by systematic ablation studies. 

- Length generalization - Studying if the carrying over implementation generalizes to longer integer additions than seen during training, using ideas like priming.

- Large language models - Attempting to relate and apply some findings from small interpretable models to large pre-trained models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper shows that small transformer models implement the carrying algorithm in a modular way, with different components handling digit addition vs carrying digits over. Does this modular implementation still hold for larger language models? What evidence is there to support or refute this?

2) The paper identifies specific neurons responsible for carrying digits over in the smaller models. Is it possible to identify similar key neurons for carrying over in larger LLMs? If so, how would one go about systematically identifying those neurons?  

3) The paper demonstrates the ability to manipulate carrying over capabilities in smaller models by ablating certain neurons. Can targeted ablation of neurons in larger LLMs also turn off/on the carrying over functionality while preserving other arithmetic capabilities?  

4) The pentagon structures found in the residual streams of smaller models seem to encode information about whether carrying over is needed. Do such geometric encodings of algorithmic functions also exist in larger LLMs? If so, can these provide insight into how functions are implemented?

5) The paper shows that a small amount of priming examples helps smaller models generalize the carrying algorithm to longer numbers. Does this priming effect hold for large models as well? How does the required amount of priming scale with model size and does the type of priming examples matter?

6) The paper suggests stabilization of attention patterns is key for length generalization in smaller models. Do attention patterns destabilize in similar ways for large models? If so, can techniques like priming also stabilize attention patterns in large models? 

7) The analysis shows the carrying steps get distributed across layers in 3-layer models compared to being concentrated in one layer for 2-layer models. How does the distribution of algorithmic steps across layers change for much deeper large LLMs?

8) The adders found in attention resemble half-adder circuits. Do large LLMs also implement modular circuit-like architectures for arithmetic functions? If so, can these be reverse engineered systematically?

9) The paper demonstrates interpreting model internals by projecting hidden states onto lower dimensions and studying separated clusters. What other analysis techniques could provide insight into how algorithms are implemented in large blackbox LLMs?

10) The findings rely on studying models trained only on addition. How do the results extend to large models trained on diverse tasks? Are cleanly separable modular implementations still found when many functionalities are interleaved?
