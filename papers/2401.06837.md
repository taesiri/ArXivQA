# [Structsum Generation for Faster Text Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06837)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing effective prompting strategies and pipelines for generating structured summaries in the form of tables and mind maps from input text passages. This includes a divide-and-generate approach for tables and an iterative expansion approach for mind maps.

2) Identifying common issues with factuality, local structure, and global structure when generating structured summaries, and proposing automatic critics to catch and correct these issues. Using the critics improves output quality by 37pp for mind maps and 15pp for tables.

3) Introducing Auto-QA coverage as an automatic metric to measure the usefulness and coverage of the generated structured summaries. This compares the ability to answer questions from the summary vs the original text.

4) Conducting user studies showing that the generated summaries lead to faster comprehension without loss of accuracy. Specifically, tables allow 42.9% faster comprehension and mind maps allow 31.9% faster comprehension compared to just reading the text.

In summary, the main contribution is developing effective methods and evaluations for generating high-quality structured summaries from text that demonstrably improve text comprehension.

The paper introduces the concept of structured summaries, focusing on tables and mind maps, as a way to help users process and comprehend information from text passages. It proposes prompting strategies and automated critics to improve the quality of automatically generated structured outputs from large language models. An evaluation methodology called Auto-QA is introduced to measure semantic coverage. Finally, a user study demonstrates the effectiveness of structured summaries in enhancing text comprehension speed and accuracy.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of Structured Summaries (\structsum{}) for faster text comprehension. What specific modalities of \structsum{} are focused on in this work and what are some key differences between them? 

2. The paper proposes different prompting strategies for tables and mind maps. Can you explain the "divide-and-generate" prompting approach for tables? What is the intuition behind generating multiple tables instead of a single table?

3. For mind maps, an iterative prompting technique is proposed. Can you walk through the steps of this technique and explain why it is better suited for mind maps compared to a simpler chain-of-thought prompting approach? 

4. Three quality dimensions - factuality, local structure and global structure - are identified as common issues for both tables and mind maps. How does the paper attempt to ensure quality along each of these dimensions?

5. The paper introduces a metric called Auto-QA coverage to automatically evaluate semantic coverage of generated structured representations. Explain what this metric tries to measure and how it is implemented. 

6. Results show that critics significantly improve output quality for both tables and mind maps. Analyze these results - which critic helps the most and why do you think that is the case?

7. For assessing the validity of Auto-QA, the paper utilizes human annotated SQuAD dataset. What was the outcome of this analysis? Do you think Auto-QA is a reasonable substitute for human annotated questions?

8. The user study results demonstrate improved comprehension metrics when using tables and mind maps compared to just text. Dive deeper into these results - what differences do you notice between tables and mind maps and how can you explain that?  

9. The paper identifies some limitations of the current work such as focus only on English, limited modalities explored etc. What are some other limitations not explicitly stated that you think should be addressed in future work?

10. The paper provides a strong baseline for structured text summarization. What enhancements or new research directions related to this problem would you suggest as high potential future work?
