# [Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling: a research direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07871)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to create agents that behave in accordance with a user's intentions, also known as the "agent alignment problem." The authors outline a research direction centered around "reward modeling" - learning a reward function from interaction with the user and then optimizing that learned reward function using reinforcement learning. The paper discusses key challenges in scaling reward modeling to complex domains, including the amount of feedback required, distributional shift issues, reward hacking, preventing unacceptable outcomes, and the reward-result gap. It then proposes several approaches to help mitigate these challenges, such as online feedback, leveraging existing data, hierarchical feedback, adversarial training, uncertainty estimates, and careful inductive bias. The overall goal is to investigate whether these approaches can help overcome the challenges to scaling reward modeling, which the authors propose as a potential solution to the agent alignment problem.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper outlines a research direction for solving the agent alignment problem in AI using reward modeling. The key idea is to separate learning what to achieve (the reward model) from how to achieve it (the policy), in order to train artificial agents that behave in accordance with human intentions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper outlines a high-level research direction for solving the agent alignment problem in reinforcement learning. It focuses on an approach called reward modeling, where a reward model is trained to learn the user's intentions and provide rewards to a reinforcement learning agent. 

Here are some key ways this paper relates to other research on agent alignment and AI safety:

- It builds on prior problem formulations and taxonomies of alignment challenges, bringing them together into one coherent picture focused on reward modeling as a solution. For example, it incorporates ideas from cooperative inverse reinforcement learning, iterated amplification, and discussions of specification problems.

- Compared to more formal/theoretical approaches to alignment, this paper is focused on empirically testing concrete algorithms and mitigation strategies. It advocates practical experiments using deep RL on games or simulated environments.

- It sees alignment as an AI capability problem to be solved via advances in ML, unlike other perspectives viewing alignment as fundamentally different from building AI systems.

- The recursive reward modeling idea connects alignment to lines of work on hierarchical RL and learning from human preferences.

- It highlights open technical questions in RL like exploration, robustness, and scalable Bayesian deep learning as relevant for alignment.

- The discussion of establishing trust relates to emerging work on interpretability, verification, and robustness for deep RL and neural nets.

Overall, this paper consolidates a lot of existing thinking around alignment and safety challenges, while pushing forward a particular research agenda focused on recursive reward modeling and deep RL. It aims to make alignment an explicit focus of technical AI capabilities research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions to solve the agent alignment problem:

1. Scaling up reward modeling: Further developing techniques like online feedback, off-policy feedback, leveraging existing data, hierarchical feedback, natural language rewards, model-based RL, side constraints, adversarial training, uncertainty estimation, and inductive biases to overcome challenges with reward modeling such as limited feedback, distributional shift, reward hacking, unacceptable outcomes, and the reward-result gap. 

2. Establishing trust in agents: Using techniques like careful system design, testing on benchmarks, increasing interpretability, formal verification of properties, and developing theoretical guarantees to be confident that trained agents are sufficiently aligned with human intentions.

3. Recursive reward modeling: Using trained agents to assist humans in evaluating outcomes when training subsequent more capable agents, allowing alignment techniques to scale up to more complex tasks.

4. Combining reward modeling with other techniques like imitation learning, inverse RL, cooperative inverse RL, debate, and amplifying expert reasoning.

5. Empirical research to evaluate the feasibility of these techniques on existing deep RL benchmarks using synthetic user feedback.

In summary, the main suggested research avenues are developing reward modeling techniques to overcome scaling challenges, establishing trust in trained agents, recursive training of more capable agents, combining reward modeling with other approaches, and empirical testing of these ideas. The end goal is developing practical and scalable methods for training aligned agents beyond human-level capability on real-world tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper outlines a research direction for solving the agent alignment problem in reinforcement learning. The key idea is to separate learning what to achieve from how to achieve it by training two models: a reward model that learns the user's intentions from feedback, and a policy that optimizes this learned reward model using reinforcement learning. This approach, called reward modeling, allows agents to be trained on complex real-world tasks where well-specified rewards are unavailable. The authors discuss key challenges reward modeling faces when scaling to more capable agents, such as minimizing the amount of feedback needed, preventing reward hacking, and handling unacceptable outcomes. They propose several approaches to address these challenges, including online feedback, model-based RL, adversarial training, and improved inductive biases. Additional techniques like testing, interpretability, and verification are proposed to establish trust in trained agents. The authors argue this research direction is promising for developing aligned agents that robustly optimize user intentions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper outlines a research direction for solving the agent alignment problem in reinforcement learning. The agent alignment problem refers to creating agents that behave according to the user's intentions. The proposed approach involves two main components: 1) learning a reward model from user feedback that captures the user's intentions, and 2) training a reinforcement learning agent to optimize the learned reward model. 

The paper discusses key challenges that need to be addressed when scaling this reward modeling approach, including providing sufficient high-quality feedback, avoiding reward hacking, and preventing unacceptable outcomes. It then proposes several techniques that may help mitigate these challenges, such as online feedback, model-based RL, adversarial training, and improved uncertainty estimates. The paper argues that solving the alignment problem is critical for applying reinforcement learning successfully to real-world problems. While the feasibility of the proposed approach remains uncertain, concrete research can elucidate whether these challenges can be sufficiently overcome.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a research direction centered around reward modeling to achieve scalable agent alignment. The key idea is to separate learning what to achieve (the objectives or "reward function") from how to achieve it (the "policy"). A reward model is trained to learn the user's intentions and objectives by soliciting feedback. This reward model then provides rewards to a reinforcement learning agent that interacts with the environment. Both the reward model and policy are trained concurrently, with the user providing online feedback to the reward model. This approach aims to solve the agent alignment problem by accurately capturing the user's intentions in the reward model, which guides the agent's behavior. The authors discuss challenges such as providing enough high-quality feedback, reward hacking, unacceptable outcomes, and establishing trust. They propose approaches like leveraging existing data, model-based RL, and formal verification to help address these challenges. Overall, the paper lays out a research direction focused on recursive reward modeling to achieve scalable and economical alignment.
