# [Moral Foundations of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15337)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions and hypotheses appear to be:

1) Do the moral foundations exhibited by large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and PaLM demonstrate a cultural and/or political bias? The hypothesis is that due to the attributes of the training data, LLMs may have acquired a consistent set of moral foundations constituting a particular cultural or political bias. 

2) Do LLMs remain consistent with their exhibited moral foundations across different conversation contexts? The hypothesis is that if the model shows high variability in its moral foundations depending on the prompt, then the judgments may be highly context-specific rather than displaying a consistent bias.

3) Can the moral reasoning of LLMs be reliably changed in predictable ways by deliberately crafting prompts? The hypothesis is that it is possible to condition LLMs to exhibit a particular moral stance or bias through targeted prompting.

4) Do different moral foundations lead to measurably different behaviors in downstream tasks? The hypothesis is that prompting an LLM to exhibit certain moral foundations will affect its behavior on unrelated downstream tasks.

In summary, the central questions focus on assessing whether LLMs display consistent moral biases, whether these can be deliberately manipulated, and whether biased moral foundations affect downstream task performance. The key hypothesis is that moral biases are present in LLMs, are consistent, can be altered, and influence unrelated behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors apply moral foundations theory (MFT) to analyze the potential biases of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and PaLM. They administer the moral foundations questionnaire (MFQ) to the LLMs to quantify their scores on dimensions like care/harm and fairness/cheating. 

2. They compare the moral foundations exhibited by the LLMs to human studies of MFQ scores across different demographics and political ideologies. The results suggest the LLMs, especially the smaller GPT-3 models, tend to resemble a politically conservative human in their default moral foundations.

3. The authors test the consistency of the LLMs' moral foundations by prompting them with random dialogues before taking the MFQ. They find the moral foundations are relatively stable across prompts, suggesting a consistent bias. 

4. They show it's possible to deliberately prompt the LLMs to overweight certain moral dimensions, taking on a predictable moral stance. The prompts that maximize each moral foundation are identified.

5. They demonstrate that prompting the LLMs to exhibit different moral foundations significantly impacts behavior on a downstream donation task. This suggests the moral stance of the LLM affects other behaviors.

6. The authors discuss implications such as the risks of LLMs producing politically biased content if deployed without appropriate prompting. They suggest prompting as a way to mitigate bias.

In summary, the main contribution is using moral foundations theory to systematically analyze the potential moral and political biases learned by LLMs, showing these biases are consistent and consequential. The authors suggest ways to mitigate the risks through prompting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper uses moral foundations theory to analyze whether large language models like GPT-3 exhibit consistent moral and political biases, and finds they give responses most similar to politically conservative humans across contexts, but can be deliberately prompted to exhibit different moral foundations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several novel contributions compared to prior work on analyzing the moral foundations and potential biases of large language models:

- It applies the full 30-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) to assess and compare the moral foundations exhibited by popular LLMs like GPT-3 and PaLM. Prior work by Fraser et al. only analyzed Delphi using a subset of the MFQ questions.  

- It compares the moral foundations of multiple LLMs like GPT-3 and PaLM to human data from psychological studies across different demographics and cultures. This allows for an analysis of which human moral profiles the LLM scores are most similar to.

- It measures the consistency of the LLMs' moral foundations across many different conversational prompts. This tests whether any biased moral tendencies are highly context-dependent or consistent.

- It shows that the LLM can be deliberately prompted to exhibit particular moral foundations corresponding to known political ideologies.

- It demonstrates that prompting the LLM to exhibit certain moral foundations significantly impacts behavior on a downstream donation task. This illustrates that moral biases can propagate to affect other applications.

Overall, this work provides a much more comprehensive analysis of the moral biases of major LLMs using the standard MFQ. It tests consistency across prompts, manipulability of moral foundations, and downstream effects on tasks like donations. The analyses of similarity to human data and downstream effects in particular go beyond prior work and help characterize risks of deploying morally-biased LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Testing whether biases exhibited by LLMs on the Moral Foundations Questionnaire transfer to a broader range of downstream tasks beyond just the donation task studied in this paper. This would help further understand the extent to which moral biases affect LLM behavior.

- Administering the Moral Foundations Questionnaire to LLMs in different languages to see if this affects their responses, since prior work shows human responses vary across languages.  

- Providing additional contextual information like the year when prompting LLMs on the MFQ, to more accurately reflect potential changes in moral views over time.

- Further research on comparing LLMs fine-tuned with reinforcement learning to human responses, since the high confidence of RL-tuned models made their MFQ responses differ significantly from humans in this study. The authors suggest using human feedback with RL could make LLM responses more human-like.

- Testing ways to deliberately prompt LLMs to exhibit more moderate political and moral views, since this paper showed it's possible to make LLMs more liberal or conservative in a consistent way. Finding ways to mitigate political bias in LLMs is important.

- Further investigating the inconsistent findings where conservative prompts led to lower donations, even though human studies show conservatives donate more. Better understanding this could shed light on potential inaccuracies in how LLMs capture human moral and political stances.

In summary, the main future directions are: broader testing of moral biases in downstream tasks, cross-lingual research, adding temporal context, using human feedback to make LLMs more human-like, prompting to reduce bias, and further analysis of inconsistencies between LLMs and human moral views.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes large language models from the perspective of moral foundation theory, which decomposes human moral reasoning into five factors. The authors compare the moral foundations exhibited by language models like GPT-3 and PaLM to studies of human participants with different political affiliations. They find the models exhibit a bias towards certain moral foundations similar to politically conservative humans. They test the consistency of this bias by prompting the models with random dialogues, and find the moral tendencies are relatively stable. The authors are able to deliberately prompt the models to exhibit different moral foundations corresponding to political ideologies, and show this affects behavior on a donation task. The results illustrate how the models may have acquired particular moral biases from training data, and that targeted prompting can exploit these biases to influence model behavior on downstream applications. This sheds light on potential unintended consequences of deploying models that assume a biased moral stance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper analyzes large language models through the lens of moral foundations theory, a psychological assessment tool that classifies human moral reasoning into five factors. The authors apply a 30-question moral foundations questionnaire to popular language models like GPT-3 and PaLM in order to assess their exhibited moral biases. They find that without any prompting, these models tend to exhibit moral foundations most similar to politically conservative humans. The authors also test the consistency of these biases by prompting the models with random dialogues, and find the exhibited morals remain relatively stable across prompts. They show it's possible to deliberately prompt the models to assume moral stances corresponding to different political ideologies, like liberalism. Finally, they test whether prompting a model to exhibit certain moral foundations subsequently affects its behavior on a charitable donation task. They find significant differences in donated amounts that correlate with differences in moral foundations scores. 

In summary, this paper provides evidence that large language models can reflect moral and political biases absorbed from their training data. Their exhibited biases remain consistent across contexts and can affect behavior on downstream tasks unrelated to moral reasoning. The authors suggest further research is needed to understand the extent such biases could propagate to real-world applications deployed using large language models like GPT-3. However, they also show it's possible to prompt the models to reduce bias, which points towards mechanisms for mitigating harm. Overall, this work sheds light on the unintended risks of moral biases in large language models and provides techniques for investigating and addressing such biases.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The authors apply the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), a 30-item psychological assessment, to measure the moral reasoning of two large language models - GPT-3 and PaLM. They feed each MFQ question into the models as prompts and have the models select one of six possible ratings as an answer. Each question is asked 50 times with randomized example ratings to avoid bias. The authors take a majority vote of the models' 50 responses to each question to derive a moral foundations score on each of five dimensions. They compare these scores to human studies of the MFQ conducted across different demographics and cultures. The authors also test the consistency of the models' moral foundations by prompting them with 50 random dialogues before administering the MFQ. Finally, they search for prompts that maximize each moral dimension score for the GPT-3 model and test whether these different moral stances affect behavior on a donation task.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit particular moral biases that remain consistent across different contexts. Specifically, it is using moral foundations theory, a tool from psychology, to analyze the moral reasoning and values encoded in popular LLMs like GPT-3 and PaLM. 

The key questions the paper investigates are:

1) Do LLMs demonstrate cultural or political biases in their default moral reasoning, as evidenced by their scores on the moral foundations questionnaire? 

2) Are the moral tendencies exhibited by LLMs consistent across different conversation contexts, or do they vary depending on the prompt?

3) Can LLMs be deliberately prompted to exhibit a particular moral stance or set of moral foundations? 

4) If an LLM is prompted to adopt certain moral foundations, does this actually change its behavior on downstream tasks?

The motivation is to understand whether biases encoded in the training data of LLMs could lead to unintended consequences when they are deployed in applications, and whether it is possible to deliberately induce certain moral biases that could affect behavior on downstream tasks. The paper uses moral foundations theory as a lens to quantify the moral values exhibited by LLMs.
