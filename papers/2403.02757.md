# [In-Memory Learning: A Declarative Learning Framework for Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models have shown the ability to improve their performance on downstream tasks through mechanisms like in-context learning, mimicking the "declarative learning" process in humans. The authors investigate if these models can demonstrate self-improvement capabilities without relying on human-labeled data. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a framework called "In-Memory Learning" (IML) to enable self-improvement in LLM agents. IML has three main components:
  - Induction: Distill general principles from current experiences
  - Revision: Refine existing guidelines using new experiences  
  - Inference: Apply updated rules for reasoning
- The process happens iteratively within the model's memory by using natural language similar to calculating gradients in neural networks.  

Key Contributions:
- Formal definition of self-improvement problem for lifelong LLM agents
- Analysis of properties required in a benchmark to properly evaluate self-improvement
- Implementation of an initial classification benchmark for evaluation
- Introduction and experiments of IML framework 
  - Systematic tests show effectiveness on proposed benchmark
  - Analysis of impact of momentum and accumulation hyperparameters
  - Demonstration of optimization challenges analogous to local minima

Overall, the paper makes a novel formulation of self-improvement in LLM agents based on human declarative learning. Through the proposed In-Memory Learning framework and experiments, it shows initial evidence that models have inherent capability for self-improvement using only naturally supervised experiences.
