# [Prompt-based Personalized Federated Learning for Medical Visual Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional medical visual question answering (VQA) methods face two key challenges - data heterogeneity across different patients/organs and privacy concerns over sharing patient data. 

- Federated learning methods enable collaborative training without sharing private data but have high communication complexity with model weight sharing.

- Transformer models like CLIP perform well on VQA but have a large number of parameters, making federated learning difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a prompt-based personalized federated learning (pFL) method for medical VQA to address heterogeneity and privacy issues. 

- Establish separate VQA model "clients" for medical image datasets of different organs. Models trained on each client's private data.

- Introduce small, learnable prompt parameters into CLIP encoder blocks instead of communicating entire model weights between clients.

- Clients integrate prompts from other clients to get shared information and customize model to their private data.

- Use reliability parameter to control each client's influence on others based on performance and task similarity.

Key Contributions:
- Novel prompt-based pFL method enables privacy-preserving collaborative training of personalized medical VQA models tailored to different organs.

- Introduction of prompts reduces communication complexity compared to sharing model weights in traditional pFL.

- Reliability parameter prevents negative impact from lower performing or dissimilar clients.

- Evaluations on VQA-RAD and Slake datasets show accuracy improvements over individualized training and state-of-the-art medical VQA methods.
