# AssistGPT: A General Multi-modal Assistant that can Plan, Execute,   Inspect, and Learn

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key points of this paper are:1. The paper proposes AssistGPT, a general multi-modal AI assistant system that can accomplish complex visual reasoning tasks by integrating large language models (LLMs) with various external tools/models in an interleaved language and code manner. 2. AssistGPT consists of four main components: - Planner: Uses LLM to plan the reasoning steps and tool invocations needed to solve the task in natural language instructions and structured code snippets. - Executor: Invokes the external tools/models using the code and manages the inputs and outputs.- Inspector: Manages visual inputs and intermediate results, providing summaries to the Planner. - Learner: Checks reasoning progress and collects successful reasoning traces as examples to improve the Planner.3. The main research questions/hypotheses addressed are:- Can the interleaved language and code reasoning approach allow an LLM-based system to accomplish complex visual reasoning by invoking necessary tools adaptively? - Can the four components (Planner, Executor, Inspector, Learner) work together to enable flexible reasoning over diverse inputs and self-improvement of the system?4. Experiments on A-OKVQA and NExT-QA benchmarks validate AssistGPT's effectiveness. Showcases also demonstrate it can handle more complex real-world queries than current benchmarks.In summary, the central goal is to develop a general framework that allows an LLM-based assistant to accomplish complex visual reasoning tasks by adaptively combining various tools, using an interleaved language and code approach along with capabilities like visual input management and self-improvement. The experiments aim to validate the efficacy of this proposed framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main contribution is proposing a new multi-modal AI assistant system called AssistGPT that can dynamically engage various tools to address complex visual-related tasks. The key ideas include:1. AssistGPT uses an interleaved code and language reasoning approach called Plan, Execute, Inspect, and Learn (PEIL) to integrate large language models with different tools/models. 2. It consists of four main components:- Planner: Controls the reasoning process and plans which tool to invoke next using natural language.- Executor: Executes the external tools and returns feedback to the Planner.- Inspector: Manages the inputs and intermediate results to assist the Planner. - Learner: Assesses system performance and records successful trials as in-context examples to improve planning.3. The PEIL approach allows flexible language planning, structured code invocation of tools, and handling of non-textual intermediate results like images and videos during complex reasoning.4. Experiments on A-OKVQA and NExT-QA benchmarks show state-of-the-art results. The system is also showcased on complex real-world examples beyond the benchmarks.In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing AssistGPT, a novel multi-modal AI assistant that can accomplish diverse visual tasks by integrating LLMs and tools in an interleaved language and code manner, along with components like Inspector and Learner to enable complex reasoning and improve planning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes AssistGPT, a multi-modal AI assistant system with an interleaved code and language reasoning approach called Plan, Execute, Inspect, and Learn (PEIL) to integrate large language models with various tools to address complex visual tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a comparison of the key aspects of this paper to other related research:- Integrating LLMs with other models/tools: This paper proposes integrating large language models (LLMs) like GPT with other specialized models and tools to create a more capable multi-modal AI assistant. Other works like HuggingGPT, Chameleon, and ViperGPT have similar goals of combining LLMs with other expert models. However, this paper introduces a novel framework with four components (Planner, Executor, Inspector, Learner) to facilitate the integration.- Interleaved language and code reasoning: A key contribution is using both natural language and structured code snippets to invoke the different tools and models. Other methods use either just language (e.g. HuggingGPT) or just code (e.g. ViperGPT), but the interleaved approach allows flexible language planning while still having structured commands to call tools.- Managing inputs and intermediate results: The Inspector module manages all the visual inputs and intermediate outputs during the reasoning process. This allows properly feeding relevant information into each tool. Other systems like ReAct struggle with handling the diverse multimedia intermediate results. - Learning mechanism: The Learner module assesses the model's outputs and guides it to retry and improve. This simple learning approach to progressively build up successful examples is novel for modular multi-modal systems.- Evaluation on benchmarks: Experiments on A-OKVQA and NExT-QA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results, showing AssistGPT's effectiveness on complex reasoning over images and videos.In summary, the key novelty is the interleaved reasoning approach and Inspector/Learner modules to handle complex multi-modal inputs and interactions. The benchmark results validate AssistGPT's capabilities for multi-modal AI assistance.
