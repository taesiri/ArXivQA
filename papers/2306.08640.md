# AssistGPT: A General Multi-modal Assistant that can Plan, Execute,
  Inspect, and Learn

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key points of this paper are:1. The paper proposes AssistGPT, a general multi-modal AI assistant system that can accomplish complex visual reasoning tasks by integrating large language models (LLMs) with various external tools/models in an interleaved language and code manner. 2. AssistGPT consists of four main components: - Planner: Uses LLM to plan the reasoning steps and tool invocations needed to solve the task in natural language instructions and structured code snippets. - Executor: Invokes the external tools/models using the code and manages the inputs and outputs.- Inspector: Manages visual inputs and intermediate results, providing summaries to the Planner. - Learner: Checks reasoning progress and collects successful reasoning traces as examples to improve the Planner.3. The main research questions/hypotheses addressed are:- Can the interleaved language and code reasoning approach allow an LLM-based system to accomplish complex visual reasoning by invoking necessary tools adaptively? - Can the four components (Planner, Executor, Inspector, Learner) work together to enable flexible reasoning over diverse inputs and self-improvement of the system?4. Experiments on A-OKVQA and NExT-QA benchmarks validate AssistGPT's effectiveness. Showcases also demonstrate it can handle more complex real-world queries than current benchmarks.In summary, the central goal is to develop a general framework that allows an LLM-based assistant to accomplish complex visual reasoning tasks by adaptively combining various tools, using an interleaved language and code approach along with capabilities like visual input management and self-improvement. The experiments aim to validate the efficacy of this proposed framework.
