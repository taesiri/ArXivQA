# [Activating More Pixels in Image Super-Resolution Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04437)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main research goal of this paper is to design an image super-resolution transformer network that can better utilize long-range dependencies in the input image to reconstruct more accurate and better quality HR images. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Existing transformer-based SR networks like SwinIR do not fully exploit long-range dependencies, utilizing only local patches rather than the full image context.

2) Combining channel attention and self-attention in a hybrid architecture can allow utilizing both global statistics and local dependencies for better SR. 

3) Adding an overlapping cross-attention module can enhance interactions between neighboring image patches/windows to reduce blocking artifacts.

4) Large-scale same-task pre-training is beneficial for unlocking the full potential of transformers for the SR task.

So in summary, the main goal is to design a hybrid attention transformer network for SR that can utilize global context better through channel attention, self-attention on larger windows, cross-window attention, and large-scale pre-training. The hypothesis is that this will allow capturing longer-range dependencies in the image to reconstruct higher quality HR images compared to existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) architecture for image super-resolution that combines channel attention and self-attention to activate more pixels and utilize more input information. 

2. It introduces an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance interaction between neighboring windows and reduce blocking artifacts.

3. It proposes an effective same-task pre-training strategy using large-scale data (ImageNet) to further exploit the potential of the model.

4. The proposed HAT method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a large margin (0.3-1.2dB). Scaling up HAT further pushes the performance boundaries.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel HAT architecture that activates more pixels by combining channel attention, self-attention, and overlapping cross-attention. The same-task pre-training also helps unlock the potential of HAT. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT in advancing the state-of-the-art in image super-resolution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) for single image super-resolution that combines channel attention and self-attention to activate more pixels and introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance cross-window information aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in image super-resolution:

- The key innovation is in using a hybrid transformer architecture (HAT) that combines self-attention with channel attention to activate more pixels and improve performance. This builds off recent work using transformers for SR like SwinIR and EDT, but makes modifications to better exploit global and local information.

- Compared to CNN-based methods, transformers have shown strong improvements for SR recently. This work continues that trend and shows transformers still have a lot of potential for further gains. The results significantly outperform other SOTA methods.

- For training, this paper advocates for a simple same-task pretraining approach using large-scale data rather than more complex multi-task pretraining. This is in contrast to some other recent works like IPT and EDT. The results support that large-scale data matters more than pretraining tasks.

- The paper provides useful experiments and visualizations to analyze model behaviors compared to CNN and transformer baselines. This helps give insights into why the proposed architecture works better.

- Scaling up model size provides further gains, demonstrating there is still a lot of room for improvement on SR by using bigger transformers. This is an important direction as compute continues to increase.

- The overall performance gains over previous SOTA are quite significant, around 0.3-1.2dB on benchmarks. This shows the impact of the ideas and continues to push the state of the art forward appreciably.

In summary, this paper makes nice contributions in transformer architecture design, training, and scaling for SR while advancing the field notably over recent prior art. The techniques and analyses provide value to research in applying transformers to low-level vision tasks.
