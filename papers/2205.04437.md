# [Activating More Pixels in Image Super-Resolution Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04437)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main research goal of this paper is to design an image super-resolution transformer network that can better utilize long-range dependencies in the input image to reconstruct more accurate and better quality HR images. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Existing transformer-based SR networks like SwinIR do not fully exploit long-range dependencies, utilizing only local patches rather than the full image context.

2) Combining channel attention and self-attention in a hybrid architecture can allow utilizing both global statistics and local dependencies for better SR. 

3) Adding an overlapping cross-attention module can enhance interactions between neighboring image patches/windows to reduce blocking artifacts.

4) Large-scale same-task pre-training is beneficial for unlocking the full potential of transformers for the SR task.

So in summary, the main goal is to design a hybrid attention transformer network for SR that can utilize global context better through channel attention, self-attention on larger windows, cross-window attention, and large-scale pre-training. The hypothesis is that this will allow capturing longer-range dependencies in the image to reconstruct higher quality HR images compared to existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) architecture for image super-resolution that combines channel attention and self-attention to activate more pixels and utilize more input information. 

2. It introduces an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance interaction between neighboring windows and reduce blocking artifacts.

3. It proposes an effective same-task pre-training strategy using large-scale data (ImageNet) to further exploit the potential of the model.

4. The proposed HAT method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a large margin (0.3-1.2dB). Scaling up HAT further pushes the performance boundaries.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel HAT architecture that activates more pixels by combining channel attention, self-attention, and overlapping cross-attention. The same-task pre-training also helps unlock the potential of HAT. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT in advancing the state-of-the-art in image super-resolution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) for single image super-resolution that combines channel attention and self-attention to activate more pixels and introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance cross-window information aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
