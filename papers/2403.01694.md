# [Tac-Man: Tactile-Informed Prior-Free Manipulation of Articulated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Manipulating articulated objects like doors and drawers is a key challenge in robotics, especially in human-centric environments. Traditional methods rely on explicit priors like kinematic models or implicit priors learned from data. However, obtaining precise priors is difficult due to:

1) Ambiguity: Visually similar objects may have different internal structures. 

2) Imperfectness: Perception noise leads to incorrect structural parameters.

3) Unknown: Some objects have complex, unfamiliar kinematics. 

4) Obsolescence: Models become outdated over time.

Proposed Solution - Tac-Man:
The paper proposes a novel tactile-informed, prior-free approach called Tac-Man that regulates stable robot-object contact during manipulation without needing object models. It uses custom GelSight-inspired tactile sensors to get high-resolution contact feedback. The key ideas are:

1) Represent contact as a point cloud relative to the gripper frame.

2) Maintain contact stability using tactile data to limit deformation and slippage. 

3) Iteratively execute small motions and recover stable contact using optimization.

The method adapts on-the-fly using tactile sensing without prior knowledge of object kinematics.

Contributions:
1) Introduces Tac-Man - a robust, adaptable, prior-free approach for manipulating articulated objects of varying complexity using only tactile sensing.

2) Real-world experiments demonstrating Tac-Man's ability to handle ambiguity, imperfectness, unfamiliarity and disturbances, outperforming traditional methods. 

3) Large-scale simulations proving Tac-Man's versatility across diverse objects and trajectories, highlighting its scalability.

The tactile-focused, prior-free strategy offers greater autonomy and reliability compared to traditional model-based techniques, especially in unpredictable environments. Advances in tactile sensing significantly expand robotic manipulation capabilities without needing accurate models.
