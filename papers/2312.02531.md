# [PolyFit: A Peg-in-hole Assembly Framework for Unseen Polygon Shapes via   Sim-to-real Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02531)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces PolyFit, a novel force/torque (F/T) sensor-based supervised learning framework for 5-degree-of-freedom peg-in-hole assembly. PolyFit is trained extensively in simulation on a diverse dataset of polygonal peg-hole pairs and contact F/T readings across varying extrinsic poses. It demonstrates a paradigm shift from reinforcement learning approaches by utilizing F/T signals for precision extrinsic pose estimation between the peg and hole. To enable adaptation to real-world applications, the authors propose sim-to-real adaptation techniques like data-level and feature-level alignment using minimal paired simulation and real-world data. Evaluations conducted for both seen and unseen polygonal shapes in simulation and real-world contexts validate PolyFit’s precision, generalization capability, and sim-to-real transferability. The framework accomplishes success rates upwards of 97.3% and 86.7% on seen shapes in simulation and real-world experiments respectively. Furthermore, PolyFit generalizes effectively to unfamiliar shapes, achieving success rates of 96.3% and 85.0% on unseen polygons. By leveraging simulation and minimally paired data for learning and adaptation, PolyFit ensures reliable peg-in-hole assembly without excessive real-world trials.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces PolyFit, an F/T-based supervised learning framework for 5-DoF peg-in-hole assembly that is trained extensively in simulation, adapts to real-world environments using minimal paired sim-real data, and generalizes effectively to diverse unseen polygon shapes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Development of a supervised learning framework for 5-DoF peg-in-hole assembly, leveraging only F/T data for extrinsic pose estimation and misalignment correction.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Peg-in-hole assembly is a foundational but challenging robotic task. Misalignments often occur between assembled parts due to sensor inaccuracies and mechanical errors, potentially causing damage through insertion failures or jamming. Prior methods have limitations - traditional techniques require manual calibration for different shapes, while learning-based approaches using vision sensors face challenges with occlusion and lighting variability. Force/torque (F/T) sensing is a promising alternative but real-world data collection introduces efficiency and safety issues. 

Proposed Solution - PolyFit Framework:
The paper introduces PolyFit, an F/T-based supervised learning framework for 5-DOF peg-in-hole assembly. It shifts the paradigm from reinforcement learning to supervised learning for this task. Extensive simulation training covers diverse polygon shapes and misalignment poses paired with corresponding F/T data. A multi-point contact strategy enhances extrinsic pose estimation from F/T by providing more comprehensive contact information. A sim-to-real adaptation method aligns real-world F/T patterns to simulations using minimal paired dataset, enabling generalization to complex unseen shapes.

Contributions:
1) Supervised learning framework for 5-DOF peg-in-hole assembly using only F/T data for extrinsic pose estimation and misalignment correction.
2) Introduction of sim-to-real adaptation method for a pose estimation model, with validation on real-world peg-in-hole assembly across untrained polygon shapes.

Results:
In simulation - 97.3% and 96.3% peg-in-hole success rate demonstrated for seen and unseen polygon shapes.
In real-world - 86.7% and 85.0% success rate achieved for seen and unseen shapes after domain adaptation, showcasing effectiveness across diverse geometries.
