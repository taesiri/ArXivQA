# [PolyFit: A Peg-in-hole Assembly Framework for Unseen Polygon Shapes via   Sim-to-real Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02531)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces PolyFit, a novel force/torque (F/T) sensor-based supervised learning framework for 5-degree-of-freedom peg-in-hole assembly. PolyFit is trained extensively in simulation on a diverse dataset of polygonal peg-hole pairs and contact F/T readings across varying extrinsic poses. It demonstrates a paradigm shift from reinforcement learning approaches by utilizing F/T signals for precision extrinsic pose estimation between the peg and hole. To enable adaptation to real-world applications, the authors propose sim-to-real adaptation techniques like data-level and feature-level alignment using minimal paired simulation and real-world data. Evaluations conducted for both seen and unseen polygonal shapes in simulation and real-world contexts validate PolyFitâ€™s precision, generalization capability, and sim-to-real transferability. The framework accomplishes success rates upwards of 97.3% and 86.7% on seen shapes in simulation and real-world experiments respectively. Furthermore, PolyFit generalizes effectively to unfamiliar shapes, achieving success rates of 96.3% and 85.0% on unseen polygons. By leveraging simulation and minimally paired data for learning and adaptation, PolyFit ensures reliable peg-in-hole assembly without excessive real-world trials.
