# [Boot and Switch: Alternating Distillation for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15564)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new unsupervised training framework called ABEL for zero-shot dense passage retrieval. The key idea is to bootstrap the training of a dense retriever and a cross-encoder reranker through an iterative alternating distillation process. Specifically, the retriever first learns to mimic BM25, then its predictions are used to train the reranker. The improved reranker provides more accurate labels to retrain the retriever. By alternating the roles of teacher and student between the retriever and reranker in each iteration, both models enhance one another progressively. Experiments show that ABEL significantly outperforms various sparse and supervised dense retrieval methods on the BEIR benchmark in the zero-shot setting. It demonstrates strong adaptation ability when directly evaluated on unseen tasks and domains. The model retains search efficiency owing to the dual-encoder architecture while achieving more accurate matching than typical supervised methods. After fine-tuning on labelled data or ensembling with existing models, ABEL achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The simplicity yet effectiveness of this framework highlights the feasibility of training high-quality dense retrievers without human annotations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised training framework called ABEL that iteratively improves a dense passage retriever and a cross-encoder reranker by having them alternate roles as teacher and student in a closed learning loop, achieving state-of-the-art performance on passage retrieval benchmarks without relying on human-annotated data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an iterative approach called ABEL (Alternating Bootstrapping training framework for unsupervised dense rEtrievaL) to bootstrap the ability of a dense retriever and a reranker without relying on manually-created data. Specifically, ABEL introduces an alternating distillation process between a dense retriever and a reranker by switching their roles as teachers and students in iterations. This creates a mutual-learning paradigm that enables iterative bidirectional knowledge flow between the retriever and reranker to enhance both components. Through experiments, the paper shows that ABEL demonstrates outstanding performance in zero-shot settings and outperforms many prominent supervised retrievers.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Dense retrieval - The paper focuses on improving neural "dense" retrieval models which encode queries and passages into dense vectors for efficient search.

- Zero-shot learning - A goal of the paper is to enhance dense retrievers in zero-shot settings where dedicated training data is scarce.

- Bootstrapping - The paper proposes an iterative bootstrapping training framework called ABEL that alternately trains a dense retriever and reranker.

- Unsupervised learning - ABEL is able to improve retrieval and ranking without relying on manually-created supervised data.

- Distillation - The training process involves distillation where the retriever and reranker alternate roles as teacher and student. 

- Dual encoder - The dense retriever uses a dual-encoder architecture to separately encode queries and passages. 

- Cross encoder - The reranker uses a cross-encoder architecture to jointly model queries and passages.

- BEIR - Performance of models is evaluated on the BEIR benchmark across multiple domains.

In summary, the key focus is on unsupervised training of dense retrievers and rerankers through an iterative bootstrapping and distillation technique.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed alternating bootstrapping framework allow for bidirectional knowledge transfer between the retriever and reranker? What are the key differences compared to typical teacher-student distillation approaches?

2. Why is using cropping-sentence queries more effective than synthetic queries generated by language models in this framework? What are the potential downsides of relying on synthetic queries? 

3. What are the advantages of having separate retriever and reranker components instead of using the retriever to generate training signals for itself? How does this design choice impact performance?

4. What challenges does the initial warm-up retriever training using BM25 aim to address? Why is BM25 a good starting point despite being a sparse retrieval method?

5. How does injecting noise into the input during retriever and reranker training lead to improved model robustness and generalizability? What is the intuition behind this?  

6. Walk through the iterative alternating distillation process in detail - what changes between the retriever and reranker at each step? How do their roles switch?

7. Why does directly fine-tuning the retriever on MS-MARCO queries degrade performance on short sentence semantic relatedness tasks? How can this limitation be addressed?

8. Analyze the model's superior performance on lexical matching datasets like Touch√© and BioASQ. What properties facilitate this?

9. Discuss the complementarity observed between this model and supervised dense retrievers. Why does ensembling them yield further gains?

10. How could the model potentially be improved by incorporating more advanced architectures like ColBERT or scaling up the model size? What benefits might this provide?
