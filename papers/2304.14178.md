# mPLUG-Owl: Modularization Empowers Large Language Models with
  Multimodality

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can we enhance large language models with multi-modal capabilities through a modularized training approach? Specifically, the paper proposes a novel training paradigm called mPLUG-Owl that aims to equip large language models (LLMs) with the ability to understand and generate responses based on multi-modal inputs, in particular visual inputs. The key ideas are:1. Use a modularized architecture with separate modules for a visual encoder, language model, and visual abstractor. This allows incorporating multi-modal knowledge while maintaining language generation performance.2. Two-stage training process:   - Stage 1: Align visual and textual knowledge by training the visual modules with frozen language model on image-text data.   - Stage 2: Jointly fine-tune the language model and visual abstractor on language-only and multi-modal supervised data to unlock diverse capabilities.   3. The joint instruction tuning allows collaboration between modalities to enhance both unimodal and multimodal abilities.The central hypothesis is that this modularized training approach can effectively impart multi-modal, especially visual, understanding abilities to LLMs while maintaining or even improving their text generation performance. Experiments on a visual instruction evaluation benchmark OwlEval demonstrate mPLUG-Owl's strong capabilities in instruction understanding, visual comprehension, reasoning, and dialogue compared to previous models.In summary, the key research question is how to train LLMs to gain multi-modal capabilities using a modularized approach with separate visual modules, and the hypothesis is that this can outperform end-to-end training or ad-hoc combination of separate models. The experiments provide evidence that the proposed mPLUG-Owl model and training paradigm can achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing mPLUG-Owl, a novel training paradigm and model architecture for equipping large language models (LLMs) with multimodal abilities through modularized learning. Specifically, mPLUG-Owl consists of a foundation LLM module, a visual knowledge module, and a visual abstractor module to support multiple modalities and enable diverse unimodal and multimodal capabilities.2. A two-stage training method to align image and text representations and learn visual knowledge while maintaining/improving the text generation abilities of the foundation LLM. The first stage trains the visual modules with frozen LLM on image-text pairs. The second stage conducts joint instruction tuning on LLM and visual abstractor modules using language-only and multimodal data.3. Carefully constructing a new visually-grounded instruction evaluation benchmark called OwlEval to assess model capabilities on visual reasoning, knowledge retrieval, dialog, etc.4. Demonstrating through experiments that mPLUG-Owl outperforms existing multimodal models like MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA on the OwlEval benchmark. The results verify mPLUG-Owl's abilities in instruction understanding, visual comprehension, knowledge transfer, reasoning, and multi-turn dialog.5. Showcasing additional promising capabilities of mPLUG-Owl such as multi-image correlation, multilingual conversation, and scene text understanding.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the mPLUG-Owl model and a modularized training approach to empower LLMs with stronger multimodal abilities, supported by a new benchmark and promising results compared to prior arts. The model architecture and training scheme enable effective fusion of vision and language knowledge in LLMs.
