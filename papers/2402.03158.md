# [Optimal and Near-Optimal Adaptive Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Quantization is an important technique used in machine learning to reduce memory footprint and accelerate computation. Adaptive vector quantization (AVQ) aims to find the optimal set of quantization values that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) for a given input vector. However, existing AVQ methods have prohibitive time and space complexity, making them infeasible for large inputs. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes new AVQ algorithms called QUantized Adaptive Vector EncodeR (QUIVER) that achieve improved time and space complexity. 

The key ideas are:
1) Use preprocessing to allow constant-time variance computation
2) Leverage concaveness properties and quadrangle inequality to reduce DP runtime 
3) Further accelerate with a closed-form solution for 3 quantization values
4) Approximate using histograms for large inputs  

Main Contributions:
1) An exact algorithm with O(s⋅d) time and O(s⋅d) space, improving on O(s⋅d^2) of prior art
2) An accelerated algorithm that quantizes optimally in just 250ms for a 1M-sized vector
3) A near-optimal approximation achieving 1+o(1) MSE in O(d)+Õ(s⋅√d) time and space

The algorithms are evaluated on various distributions and significantly outperform prior AVQ solutions in runtime while achieving near-optimal MSE. This opens the door for using optimal AVQ more extensively in ML applications like gradient compression and post-training quantization.
