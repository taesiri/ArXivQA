# [AFLoRA: Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation in Parameter Efficient   Fine-Tuning of Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models like BERT on downstream tasks is very computationally expensive. 
- Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA add trainable low-rank matrices to approximate the full fine-tuned weights. However, they still have limitations in computation costs and overfitting.

Proposed Method (AFLoRA):
- Proposes a novel PEFT method called Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation. 
- Adds a parallel path of trainable low-rank matrices (down-projection, up-projection, feature transforms) similar to LoRA.
- Introduces a "freezing score" to determine when to freeze the projection matrices during training. Freezes them incrementally based on this score to reduce overfitting.

Key Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GLUE benchmark while requiring 9.5x fewer average trainable parameters than LoRA.
- Yields up to 1.86x faster training time and 2.96x less FLOPs compared to ELoRA.
- Analyzes trainability requirements of different modules via ablation studies. Provides insights on freezing projection matrices.
- Overall, proposes an efficient and effective PEFT method that reduces overfitting and computation costs.

In summary, the paper presents AFLoRA, a novel PEFT technique to fine-tune large language models that adaptively freezes parts of the added low-rank matrices over time. This reduces overfitting and computation costs while achieving better performance than prior PEFT methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adaptively freezes trainable low-rank matrices added in parallel to frozen pre-trained weights based on a novel freezing score, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing parameters and computation costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method called Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA). Specifically:

- For each pre-trained frozen weight tensor, AFLoRA adds a parallel path of trainable low-rank matrices (down-projection and up-projection) along with feature transformation vectors. 

- It initially keeps these projection matrices and vectors trainable. 

- Then during fine-tuning, it incrementally freezes the projection matrices based on a proposed "freezing score" that acts as a proxy for the trainability requirement. 

- This helps reduce overfitting while also improving computation efficiency compared to prior PEFT methods.

- Experiments show AFLoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on GLUE benchmark while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters than methods like LoRA. It also reduces training time and FLOPs compared to ELoRA.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposed AFLoRA method for efficient and accurate fine-tuning of large pre-trained models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Refers to methods that allow fine-tuning of large pre-trained models with only a small number of additional trainable parameters.

- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): A PEFT method that adds a trainable low-rank path in parallel to the frozen pre-trained weights.

- Efficient LoRA (ELoRA): An extension of LoRA that freezes the low-rank path and adds trainable feature transformation vectors. Reduces parameters but increases compute.

- Adaptive Freezing of LoRA (AFLoRA): The proposed method. Starts with a trainable LoRA path, then progressively freezes projection matrices based on a "freezing score" to reduce overfitting.  

- Freezing Score: A novel score proposed that acts as a proxy for the trainability requirement of a weight tensor. Used to determine when to freeze LoRA projection matrices.

- Projection Matrices (PM): The low-rank down-projection and up-projection matrices that are part of the LoRA path. AFLoRA progressively freezes these.

- Feature Transformation Vectors: Additional trainable vectors added after each LoRA projection matrix in ELoRA and AFLoRA.

In summary, the key novelty of this paper is the proposed AFLoRA method and associated freezing score to adaptively determine when to freeze components of a trainable LoRA path during fine-tuning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA)? How does it aim to improve upon existing methods like LoRA and ELoRA?

2. Explain the module structure used in AFLoRA. What are the key components and how do they interact with the frozen pre-trained weights? 

3. What is the freezing score proposed in AFLoRA and how is it used to determine which projection matrices to freeze? Walk through the key equations that define the freezing score.

4. What schedule is used to freeze the projection matrices in AFLoRA? Explain why a cubic schedule was chosen over other options. 

5. The results show that keeping the projection matrices in the feedforward network (FFN) trainable yields better performance than the attention layers. Why might this be the case?

6. How does AFLoRA aim to balance performance, efficiency of parameters, and computational costs compared to existing methods? Explain the key tradeoffs it is making.

7. What were some of the other sensitivity scores explored in the ablation studies? How did they compare to the chosen freezing score?

8. The results show improved performance over keeping the projection matrices always frozen or always trainable. Explain why adaptively freezing may achieve a regularization effect.  

9. The freezing trends show the down projection matrix and intermediate FFN layer require longer initial training. Provide some hypotheses for why this might occur.

10. The method averages the number of trainable parameters over epochs. How could a variable parameter count during training impact optimization and learning?
