# [ReCoRe: Regularized Contrastive Representation Learning of World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09056)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new world model approach called Regularized Contrastive Representation learning (ReCoRe) that learns invariant feature representations to improve sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization in reinforcement learning. ReCoRe utilizes contrastive learning on augmented observations to extract invariant features. However, naively integrating contrastive loss into world models fails due to lack of supervisory signals. To address this, ReCoRe uses an intervention-invariant regularizer in the form of an auxiliary task like depth prediction that enforces invariance to texture variations. Experiments on navigation tasks in iGibson and DMControl environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. ReCoRe outperforms leading model-free and model-based RL techniques like RAD, CURL, DreamerV2, and even a pretrained visual model combined with DreamerV2. Ablations validate that both the contrastive loss and invariant regularizer are crucial components. Key results show improved generalization to unseen textures and scenes, better sim-to-real transfer, and higher sample efficiency. The framework paves the way for designing interventions and corresponding invariant auxiliary losses to learn robust features.
