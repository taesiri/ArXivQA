# [On Computing Plans with Uniform Action Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper introduces a new objective for automated planning - finding plans whose action costs are as uniform (less dispersed) as possible. Uniform plans provide agents, especially humans executing the plans, with a sense of stability and predictability. This is useful in real-world applications like navigation, where drivers may prefer routes with steady traffic over shortest but highly variable routes; and financial planning, where people may prefer fixed savings plans over volatile ones, even if longer. 

Solution:
The paper adapts three statistical dispersion metrics to measure uniformity of plans - number of different action costs, delta (largest difference between adjacent action costs), and range. It then provides three compilations to reformulate planning tasks to lexicographically optimize sum of action costs and the given dispersion metric. The key idea is to add propositions tracking metrics like min, max costs used so far, and actions updating them. Additional end actions then penalize dispersion.

Contributions:
1. A new bi-objective planning problem combining cost and uniformity useful in real-world. 

2. Adaptation of three dispersion metrics to measure plan uniformity.

3. Three compilations to produce plans optimizing cost and the given dispersion metric.

4. New planning benchmarks combining cost and uniformity objectives.

5. Experimental evaluation showing the compilation-based approach can effectively produce pareto-optimal cost vs uniformity plans on many planning benchmarks. The simplest compilation tracking number of different costs scales well while also approximating other metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel bi-objective automated planning problem of finding cost-optimal plans whose action costs are as uniformly distributed as possible, proposes three metrics to measure action cost uniformity, and presents planning task reformulations to lexicographically optimize cost and uniformity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of a novel bi-objective planning task with many real-world applications: finding cost-optimal plans whose actions have costs that are as uniform as possible, i.e., action costs have low dispersion.

2. Adaptation of three different dispersion metrics to automated planning: number of different action costs, delta, and range.

3. Three different compilations to produce plans that lexicographically optimize sum of action costs and the given dispersion metric. 

4. New benchmarks where to test multi-objective planning algorithms.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing and formulating the novel problem of finding plans that balance cost-optimality and uniformity of action costs, as well as providing methods and benchmarks for this bi-objective planning task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Uniformest cost-optimal planning - The paper introduces the novel concept of finding plans that optimize both cost and uniformity of action costs. 

- Dispersion metrics - The paper adapts three statistical dispersion metrics to measure uniformity of action costs in plans: number of different action costs, delta, and range.

- Compilations - The paper presents compilations or reformulations of planning tasks to lexicographically optimize cost and uniformity based on the different dispersion metrics.

- Navigation, financial planning - The paper discusses potential real-world applications in domains like navigation and financial planning where uniform action costs are desirable.

- Scalability, optimality - The paper evaluates both scalability and optimality of the different compilations on a large benchmark of planning tasks. The number of different action costs compilation is shown to scale comparably to standard planning.

In summary, the key focus is on multi-objective planning to optimize cost and uniformity of action costs, using different dispersion metrics and compilations. The solutions are analyzed across metrics like coverage, execution time overhead, dispersion suboptimality and scalability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three different compilations to produce plans that lexicographically optimize sum of action costs and a given dispersion metric. Could you explain in more detail how each of these compilations works and what modifications they make to the original planning task? 

2. Why do the authors focus on adapting dispersion metrics like number of different action costs, delta, and range rather than more common statistical dispersion measures like standard deviation? What are the advantages and limitations of optimizing for these specific metrics?

3. The experimental results show that optimizing for number of different action costs has much lower overhead compared to the other compilations. Why might this be the case? Does optimizing this simpler metric still produce good approximations for other dispersion measures?  

4. The paper argues that generating plans with uniform action costs is useful in many real-world planning applications. Could you expand on some examples beyond navigation and financial planning where optimizing for uniformity might be valuable?

5. One of the conclusions is that the compilation for optimizing number of different action costs scales well and can implicitly optimize more complex metrics too. How exactly does restricting the variety of action costs help optimize other dispersion measures? 

6. How do the theoretical properties of the proposed compilations, like completeness, soundness, and complexity, compare? Are some compilations more likely to suffer from issues like oversubscription than others?

7. The evaluation uses A* search to solve the compiled planning tasks. How might the performance of satisficing planners compare when solving these reformulated problems? Would they be more or less effective?

8. The finance and navigation domains are introduced as novel planning benchmarks for this problem setting. What makes these domains particularly challenging for generating uniform plans compared to existing benchmarks?  

9. Could the proposed methods for optimizing uniformity be extended to numeric planning tasks where action costs are continuous rather than discrete? What new challenges might arise?

10. The paper focuses on optimizing one definition of uniformity at a time. How might the approach be extended to optimize for multiple dispersion metrics simultaneously? Would a multi-objective search be required?
