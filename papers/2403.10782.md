## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Visible-infrared person re-identification (V-I ReID) aims to match people across visible (RGB) and infrared camera images, which is challenging due to the significant discrepancy in appearance between these modalities. State-of-the-art methods rely on either global or part-based representations or an intermediate bridging domain, but have limitations in effectively capturing discriminative identity information that is invariant to the modality shift. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Bidirectional Multi-step Domain Generalization (BMDG) approach to learn a robust representation for matching people across visible and infrared images. The key idea is to extract aligned part prototypes from both modalities that capture consistent semantic body parts, and progressively combine more prototypes to construct multiple intermediate feature spaces that bridge the domain gap. 

Specifically, BMDG consists of two main modules:
1) Part prototype alignment learning: Discovers prototypical part features from both modalities using hierarchical contrastive learning to ensure they are complementary, interchangeable and identity-discriminative.
2) Bidirectional multi-step learning: Progressively mixes aligned part prototypes from V and I images through multiple steps to synthesize intermediate features. This gradually reduces modality discrepancy in the feature space for more effective matching.

By leveraging prototype parts to construct bridging domains and training bidirectionally, BMDG is able to focus on invariant identity cues instead of modality-specific patterns. The intermediate domains also allow adapting the model from easier samples towards harder ones with more domain gaps through a curriculum-based approach.

Main Contributions:
- Novel way to construct multiple virtual bridging domains between modalities at feature-level based on discovering and aligning prototypical parts 
- Bidirectional multi-step training strategy to progressively reduce domain discrepancy by combining prototypes
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art global, part-based and intermediate methods for V-I ReID on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets
- Can be integrated with other part-based models to improve cross-modal matching accuracy
