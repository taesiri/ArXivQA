# [Small Models, Big Insights: Leveraging Slim Proxy Models To Decide When   and What to Retrieve for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12052)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) sometimes produce incorrect or hallucinated content despite being trained on large datasets. Integrating retrieval systems with LLMs has been proposed to provide them with relevant external knowledge and improve reliability. 

- However, determining when retrieval is necessary vs when the LLM already knows the answer is challenging. Existing solutions either fine-tune the LLM, which is computationally expensive, or assess retrieval need based on preliminary LLM outputs, which increases inference costs.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes SlimPLM, which employs a smaller "proxy" LLM to generate a preliminary "heuristic" answer to judge the retrieval need. 

- If proxy model's quality is high, retrieval may not be needed. If not, the heuristic answer is decomposed into distinct claims which are used to query only the missing knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes using a slim proxy LLM to perceive LLM knowledge gaps and guide selective retrieval, avoiding full fine-tuning or multiple inferences of the LLM itself.

- Devises query rewriting method based on decomposing heuristic answer into factual claims related to the question. Rewritten queries undergo further filtering to improve retrieval relevance.

- Achieves superior performance over baselines on five QA datasets while notably reducing computational overhead of determining and performing retrieval. Validates feasibility and effectiveness of proxy model approach.

In summary, the key innovation is using a smaller proxy model to guide targeted knowledge retrieval for large models, increasing efficiency and reliability. The claim decomposition and filtering mechanisms also help improve retrieval quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces SlimPLM, a novel approach that leverages a small proxy language model to generate heuristic answers for determining when and how to perform retrieval to augment large language models, improving performance while minimizing computational costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It proposes a novel approach called SlimPLM that leverages a relatively smaller language model as a "proxy model" to help determine when and how to perform retrieval for large language models (LLMs). 

2. It devises a retrieval necessity judgment model based on the heuristic answer generated by the proxy model. This model can accurately identify which queries necessitate further information retrieval.

3. It formulates a query rewriting strategy that decomposes the heuristic answer into distinct claims. This is complemented by a claim-based filtering mechanism to enhance the relevance of the retrieval results for the LLM's text generation.

In summary, the key innovation is using a smaller proxy model to provide heuristic guidance on when retrieval is needed and what specific knowledge gaps should be addressed through retrieval. This allows more targeted and efficient retrieval to augment LLMs. Experiments demonstrate improved performance over various baselines while adding little computational overhead.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Proxy model - A smaller language model used to generate heuristic answers and provide signals about retrieval necessity
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) - Integrating retrieval systems with large language models to provide external knowledge 
- Retrieval necessity judgment - Determining when supplementary retrieval is needed for a given question
- Query rewriting - Reformulating queries based on heuristic answers to better target missing knowledge
- Claim filtering - Selectively retrieving information only for claims lacking in the language model's knowledge
- Knowledge gap - The disparity between smaller and larger models' mastery of questions requiring retrieval
- Instruction fine-tuning - Leveraging natural language prompts to adapt models for specialized tasks
- Computational efficiency - Using smaller proxy models to limit expensive inferences by larger models

The core focus seems to be employing slim proxy models to perceive knowledge gaps in large language models, thereby enhancing the retrieval process to fill those gaps during text generation. Key goals are improving performance while minimizing computational costs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does SlimPLM determine when retrieval is necessary for a given question? What specifically does it analyze in the heuristic answer from the proxy model to make this decision?

2. Why does SlimPLM use a smaller proxy model rather than conducting retrieval necessity analysis directly on the large language model (LLM)? What are the tradeoffs with this approach?

3. The query rewriting strategy decomposes the heuristic answer into distinct claims. How does it transform a potentially verbose, rambling answer into a set of clear, concise claims? What NLP techniques are involved?  

4. How does the claim-based filtering mechanism determine which rewritten queries necessitate further retrieval? Does it simply reuse the retrieval necessity judgment model, or does it employ additional analysis tailored for claims?

5. What forms of background knowledge alignment exist between the proxy model and the LLM? How does this enable the proxy model to effectively predict the LLM's mastery of different areas? 

6. How robust is SlimPLM to mismatches or gaps between the proxy model and LLM's knowledge? When would it fail or falter due to proxy model limitations?

7. The computational analysis shows the proxy model and auxiliary models require far fewer tokens than LLM inference. But how do the actual runtimes compare? What optimizations or architectures boost efficiency?

8. How does the query rewriting model balance extracting all relevant claims from the heuristic answer and avoiding excessive queries that necessitate excessive retrieval? 

9. Could the proxy model be periodically updated or fine-tuned to better match evolutions in the LLM's knowledge over time? Would this further improve retrieval accuracy?

10. How does SlimPLM handle open-ended conversational queries rather than well-formed information-seeking questions? Would the claim decomposition strategy work effectively in conversational contexts?
