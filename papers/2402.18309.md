# [Enhancing Roadway Safety: LiDAR-based Tree Clearance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Trees and vegetation growing near roads can obstruct drivers' views and fall into the road, posing safety hazards. Managing this vegetation is challenging and labor-intensive for municipalities. 
- Simple cameras lack depth information to accurately estimate clearance space above roads. LiDAR provides 3D data but has mainly been used for autonomous driving applications so far.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an automated system to analyze LiDAR point clouds to identify parts of trees growing into the regulated vertical clearance above roads. 
- Use semantic segmentation to classify LiDAR points into vegetation, road, and other. 
- Find road edges by checking distribution of neighboring points around each point. 
- Connect road edge points into polygon representing road area.
- Filter vegetation points inside vertical clearance volume above polygon to identify non-compliant tree parts.

Main Contributions:
1) Concatenation of multiple LiDAR scans for better scene coverage
2) Semantic segmentation model tuned for vegetation and road classes
3) New contour detection algorithm for finding edges of planar surfaces 
4) Method for cropping 3D point cloud to clearance volume 
5) Projection of identified non-compliant vegetation points onto camera images

Proposed system aims to help municipalities systematically inspect and manage roadside vegetation more efficiently, improving road safety. Code is available publicly.
