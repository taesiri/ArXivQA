# [Online Training of Large Language Models: Learn while chatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing paradigms for user interaction with large language models (LLMs) have limitations. Offline training methods are computationally expensive and inflexible to update. Online methods like retrieval or prompting struggle to persistently update model knowledge. 

- There is a need for persistent, efficient, and customizable learning in LLMs based on user interactions. This allows models to incrementally improve based on individual user needs.

Solution - "Online Training using External Interactions":
- Proposes a new interaction paradigm that enables real-time fine-tuning of LLMs through natural language conversations and instructions from users. 

- Allows seamless switching between conversational interactions and triggering on-the-fly model updates by preceding instructions with "[Learn]".

- Involves 3 types of customizable learning: Instruction-Guided Learning to tailor responses based on user preferences, Document-Driven Learning to train on specific documents, and Web Search-Enabled Learning to retrieve and learn from real-time web information.

- Aims to enable persistent and efficient learning while being flexible and responsive to individual user needs for personalization.

Contributions:
- Classification of existing interaction paradigms and proposal of a new "Online Parameter-Variant" method.

- Introduction of the "Online Training using External Interactions" paradigm for personalized, persistent and efficient real-time learning in LLMs.

- Outline of a customizable UI with conversational interactions and natural language triggers for on-demand model fine-tuning based on 3 types of external interactions.

In summary, the paper identifies limitations in existing methods for user interaction with LLMs and proposes a new paradigm to enable persistent, efficient and customizable real-time learning through external interactions with users.
