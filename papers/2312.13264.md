# [dIR -- Discrete Information Retrieval: Conversational Search over   Unstructured (and Structured) Data with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Data is stored in both structured and unstructured formats (e.g. product databases, patient records, reviews). Querying both to power conversations is challenging.  
- Prior work has limitations in leveraging free text data or handling complex queries across hybrid data sources.

Proposed Solution - Discrete Information Retrieval (dIR):
- Takes free text and extracts structured representations using LLMs - e.g. identifies key attributes like product size from description text.  
- Provides a unified SQL interface to query the structured and unstructured data.  
- Converts natural language questions into SQL via LLM semantic parsing.
- Can leverage conversational agents like ReAct for multi-step reasoning.

Key Contributions:
- Enables complex queries on free text by extracting structure. Significantly extends what is possible compared to standard IR or SQL on text fields.
- No model fine-tuning or SQL modifications needed. Utilizes in-context learning for text-to-SQL.
- Validated on large proprietary cross-domain dataset with 11k+ products per table and very complex queries.
- Outlines optimizations like cross-domain grounding of the discretized data.

In summary, the paper introduces a method to take advantage of free text data by inferring structure from it, providing a unified SQL interface for querying alongside structured data. This enables more complex conversational queries than possible before. The approach is validated on complex queries across a large dataset.
