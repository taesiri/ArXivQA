## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper provides a comprehensive practical guide for using Large Language Models (LLMs) in downstream natural language processing tasks. It offers a unique perspective compared to most existing works on LLMs, which tend to focus on presenting new model architectures, pretraining techniques, or benchmark results. Some key differences between this paper and other related works:- Scope and Approach: This paper takes a broad look at applying LLMs to various NLP tasks from a practical standpoint. It provides concrete advice and examples of successful use cases as well as limitations. Other papers are often narrower in scope, focusing on a specific model, task, or technique.- Data-Centric View: This work emphasizes the critical role of data at all stages - pretraining, tuning, and testing. It analyzes how data impacts model selection and performance. This data-driven perspective is less common in papers introducing new models.- Task-Oriented Structure: The paper is structured around different categories of NLP tasks and abilities. This differs from model-centric papers organized by architecture and helps readers directly find practical guidance for their task.- Model Comparison: The paper systematically compares LLMs to fine-tuned models across tasks.
