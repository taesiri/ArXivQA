## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Factorizable Transformer for energy-efficient deployment of Transformers. The key idea is to factorize the large Transformer blocks into two smaller components - a Local Transformer block and a Global Transformer block. The Local Transformer focuses on modeling local dependencies using a dilated convolution structure, while the Global Transformer models longer range dependencies. Specifically, the Local Transformer block uses a novel relative-position, dilated Transformer layer to model local contexts. The Global Transformer block employs a downsampled absolute self-attention mechanism to efficiently capture global contexts. The two components are designed to be applied sequentially - the Local Transformer extracts local features which are then processed by the Global Transformer to incorporate global information. This factorization allows deploying the Transformer layers with significantly fewer parameters and computations, thereby improving energy efficiency. The Local Transformer can also be run completely on-device to reduce latency while the Global Transformer runs server-side. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the proposed framework achieves superior efficiency in terms of FLOPs and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on various NLP tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel speech enhancement method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The key ideas are:

1) A deep CNN architecture is designed for speech enhancement. The model contains multiple convolutional layers to extract spectral features, followed by fully-connected layers to map the features to an enhanced speech spectrogram. 

2) A mixed-bandwidth training strategy is used. The CNN is trained on both narrowband (8kHz) and wideband (16kHz) speech data. This allows the model to learn useful representations for both bandwidths.

3) Multi-target learning is utilized to optimize the CNN to predict both the clean speech spectrogram and ideal ratio mask. Jointly predicting these targets encourages the model to learn better representations for speech separation and enhancement.

4) Data augmentation techniques like adding noises and reverberation are employed to make the model more robust. 

In summary, the paper puts forth a deep CNN architecture trained with mixed-bandwidth data and multi-target learning to perform robust speech enhancement. The proposed method achieves improved performance over conventional methods.
