# [Control Barrier Functions in Dynamic UAVs for Kinematic Obstacle   Avoidance: A Collision Cone Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) like quadrotors are being used in many applications nowadays. However, their safe operation heavily relies on effective collision avoidance techniques, especially in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. Existing methods like artificial potential fields, reachability analysis, nonlinear MPC etc have limitations. The paper aims to address the problem of safe trajectory tracking and collision avoidance for quadrotors in the presence of moving obstacles using control barrier functions (CBFs).

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel CBF formulation based on the notion of "collision cones" that ensures the relative velocity between the quadrotor and obstacle always avoids a cone of vectors that can lead to collision. This is done by constraining the angle between the relative position and velocity vectors. Feasibility is achieved by formulating this as a Quadratic Program (CBF-QP). 

The proposed "Collision Cone CBF (C3BF)" is adapted for quadrotor dynamics and obstacles of different shapes and sizes - spherical (3D CBF) and cylindrical (Projection CBF). Theoretical proofs are provided to show these formulations are valid CBFs that guarantee forward invariance of safe set.

The C3BF-QP method is compared with state-of-the-art Higher Order CBF (HO-CBF) to highlight its advantages in terms of less conservatism and better safety guarantees.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel CBF formulation using collision cones for quadrotor collision avoidance with formal verification.
2) Handles static & moving obstacles of different shapes and sizes.
3) Shows proposed C3BF is better than HO-CBF through comparisons.
4) Demonstrates robustness w.r.t multiple obstacles and multiple quadrotors with C3BF-QP

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through various simulations scenarios in PyBullet.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel collision avoidance technique for quadrotors based on control barrier functions and collision cones to ensure safe trajectory tracking around moving obstacles of different shapes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Formulating a direct method for safe trajectory tracking of quadrotors based on collision cone control barrier functions expressed through a quadratic program. 

2) Considering static and constant velocity obstacles of various dimensions and providing mathematical guarantees for collision avoidance using the proposed approach.

3) Comparing the collision cone CBF with the state-of-the-art higher-order CBF (HO-CBF), and showing how the former is better in terms of feasibility and safety guarantees.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new collision cone CBF formulation for quadrotors to safely avoid obstacles, along with a formal analysis and comparison to existing methods. The key ideas are leveraging CBF-QPs for real-time implementation and utilizing collision cones to constrain the relative velocity between the quadrotor and obstacles.
