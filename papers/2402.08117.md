## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Molecular sequence analysis is crucial for understanding the structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics of biomolecules. Existing methods like neural networks are accurate but computationally expensive, require large datasets, and have extensive parameter tuning. There is a need for accessible, efficient and lightweight solutions especially for low resource scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel universal approach that combines compression algorithms (Gzip, Bz2) with Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to analyze molecular sequences. 

Key steps:
1) Encode and compress sequences using Gzip/Bz2 
2) Use compressed sequence lengths to compute NCD between all sequence pairs - gives distance matrix
3) Symmetrize distance matrix 
4) Convert to Gaussian kernel matrix  
5) Apply kernel PCA to get vector representations of sequences

Main Contributions:

1) Eliminates need for large neural networks by using a lightweight compression-NCD framework
2) Works well in low-data regimes unlike neural networks
3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance in sequence classification (DNA dataset)
4) Overcomes limitations of earlier compression-only method by using kernel framework after NCD computation 
5) Provides theoretical justifications like RKHS, positive definiteness for employing kernel matrix

Key Benefits:
Simplicity, efficiency, accessibility and superior accuracy compared to neural networks and other baseline methods. Has potential for analyzing sequences and aiding molecular biology studies even with limited data.
