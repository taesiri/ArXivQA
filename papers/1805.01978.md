# [Unsupervised Feature Learning via Non-Parametric Instance-level   Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01978)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:Can we learn a good feature representation that captures apparent similarity among image instances, without any class labels, by merely asking the feature to be discriminative of individual instances?The key hypothesis is that by formulating unsupervised learning as an instance-level discrimination problem, the learned features will capture apparent visual similarity among instances, similar to how class-level supervised learning captures apparent similarity among classes.In summary, the paper explores an unsupervised learning approach driven by instance-level discrimination, with the goal of learning feature representations that reflect meaningful visual similarities among instances. The main hypothesis is that this approach can discover intrinsic visual relationships from the data itself, without any semantic class labels.
