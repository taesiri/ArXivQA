# [Unsupervised Feature Learning via Non-Parametric Instance-level   Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01978)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:Can we learn a good feature representation that captures apparent similarity among image instances, without any class labels, by merely asking the feature to be discriminative of individual instances?The key hypothesis is that by formulating unsupervised learning as an instance-level discrimination problem, the learned features will capture apparent visual similarity among instances, similar to how class-level supervised learning captures apparent similarity among classes.In summary, the paper explores an unsupervised learning approach driven by instance-level discrimination, with the goal of learning feature representations that reflect meaningful visual similarities among instances. The main hypothesis is that this approach can discover intrinsic visual relationships from the data itself, without any semantic class labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel unsupervised feature learning approach called instance-level discrimination. The key idea is to treat each image instance as a distinct class and train a classifier to maximize distinction between individual instances. 2. It formulates the instance-level classification using a non-parametric softmax, which allows the learned feature representation and metric to transfer well to downstream tasks. This is different from prior works like Exemplar CNN that use a parametric approach.3. It handles the computational challenges of modeling a large number of instance classes through two techniques - noise-contrastive estimation and proximal regularization. These make the approach scalable.4. It advocates for a consistent non-parametric framework for both training and testing. The features are stored in a memory bank and kNN classification is performed based directly on the learned feature metric space. 5. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification under unsupervised learning settings. The compact 128-dim representation also shows strong generalization ability on other transfer learning tasks like semi-supervised learning and object detection.In summary, the main contribution is a new unsupervised learning approach based on instance-level discrimination, which can learn semantically meaningful feature representations and image metrics in a purely data-driven way. The non-parametric formulation and training techniques also enable scalability.
