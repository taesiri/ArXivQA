# [Correspondences of the Third Kind: Camera Pose Estimation from Object   Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04527)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key ideas from the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of "reflection correspondences" to enable accurate camera pose and object shape estimation from only object appearance, without relying on background pixels or texture. The key insight is that humans can estimate camera motion between images of a mirror-like object by disentangling the reflection from the surface appearance. The authors formalize the idea of correspondences in the reflected world observed through the object surface. However, extracting these reflection correspondences directly from images is challenging due to complex image formation. Instead, they first recover an approximate surface normal map and reflectance map from each image using a learning-based shape-from-shading method. Reflectance maps associate surface normals with surrounding radiance. Correspondences can then be established between these reflectance maps. However, due to the bas-relief ambiguity, recovered normals and maps still suffer from ambiguity. To resolve this, the paper shows mathematically that combining pixel, 3D and reflection correspondences enables accurate estimation of relative camera pose. They introduce a method to extract features robust to ambiguity and match correspondences across views. A two-step algorithm leverages these correspondences for pose estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the reflection correspondences and proposed method enables accurate camera pose and shape recovery from minimal image pairs of textureless, reflective objects.
