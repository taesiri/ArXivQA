# [Correspondences of the Third Kind: Camera Pose Estimation from Object   Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04527)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key ideas from the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of "reflection correspondences" to enable accurate camera pose and object shape estimation from only object appearance, without relying on background pixels or texture. The key insight is that humans can estimate camera motion between images of a mirror-like object by disentangling the reflection from the surface appearance. The authors formalize the idea of correspondences in the reflected world observed through the object surface. However, extracting these reflection correspondences directly from images is challenging due to complex image formation. Instead, they first recover an approximate surface normal map and reflectance map from each image using a learning-based shape-from-shading method. Reflectance maps associate surface normals with surrounding radiance. Correspondences can then be established between these reflectance maps. However, due to the bas-relief ambiguity, recovered normals and maps still suffer from ambiguity. To resolve this, the paper shows mathematically that combining pixel, 3D and reflection correspondences enables accurate estimation of relative camera pose. They introduce a method to extract features robust to ambiguity and match correspondences across views. A two-step algorithm leverages these correspondences for pose estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the reflection correspondences and proposed method enables accurate camera pose and shape recovery from minimal image pairs of textureless, reflective objects.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces reflection correspondences to enable accurate camera pose and joint shape estimation from the appearance of textureless, reflective objects by resolving ambiguities arising from distortions in pixel, 3D, and reflection correspondences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new type of correspondences called "reflection correspondences". Specifically:

- The paper introduces the concept of reflection correspondences, which are point correspondences in the reflected world (i.e. the scene reflected by the object surface). These correspondences match image locations where light rays creating specular reflections come from the same direction in different views. 

- The paper shows that using reflection correspondences together with pixel correspondences and 3D correspondences on the object surface can help resolve ambiguities in recovering camera pose and object shape. Neither type of correspondence alone is sufficient.

- The paper proposes a method to establish reflection correspondences by recovering camera-view reflectance maps from estimated surface normals in each view. It also introduces a neural network to establish pixel and 3D correspondences that are robust to distortions caused by the generalized bas-relief ambiguity.

- The paper presents an optimization framework to jointly estimate camera pose and object shape by leveraging all three types of correspondences. Experiments demonstrate that reflection correspondences and the proposed method components are essential for accurate reconstruction from just two views of a textureless, reflective object.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction and use of reflection correspondences to overcome inherent ambiguities in structure-from-motion and shape-from-shading in specular objects, enabling robust camera pose and geometry estimation from minimal image inputs.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Estimating camera pose between two views of a textureless, reflective object is very challenging. Traditional structure-from-motion methods rely on pixel correspondences which fail on such objects due to changes in appearance from reflections. Recovering geometry from each image suffers from generalized bas-relief ambiguity, leading to incorrect 3D correspondences. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using a new type of correspondence called "reflection correspondences". These match image locations where light rays creating specular reflections originate from the same direction in the two views. To establish these, the method recovers a reflectance map from each image using estimated normals, then matches them. 

The paper shows that combining pixel, 3D and reflection correspondences can resolve ambiguities and estimate accurate relative camera pose and object shape. A two-step algorithm first estimates a combined transformation using pixel and 3D correspondences. Reflection correspondences are then used to decompose this into the camera rotation and bas-relief transformations.

A neural network is trained using augmented synthetic data to establish robust 3D and reflection correspondences despite distortions. The whole system alternates between improving correspondences, camera poses and shape estimates.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of reflection correspondences between views as a new type of matching primitives 
- Demonstrating that combining reflection correspondences with pixel and 3D ones can resolve inherent ambiguities in this problem
- A two-step algorithm to effectively leverage all correspondence types for accurate camera pose estimation
- A neural architecture to establish reliable correspondences despite distortions
- An iterative joint refinement procedure for camera pose and object shape

The method expands the applicability of geometric computer vision techniques by removing restrictive requirements like static backgrounds. The concept of reflection correspondences could also benefit other problems involving reflective objects.
