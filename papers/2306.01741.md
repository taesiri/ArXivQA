# [GPT Models Meet Robotic Applications: Co-Speech Gesturing Chat System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01741)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research objective seems to be exploring ways of integrating recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT into practical robotic applications, specifically for developing highly responsive chatbot systems. The key ideas explored in the paper are:- Utilizing LLMs like GPT-3 and ChatGPT as the backend for a chatbot system to handle a wide range of conversational topics and contexts.- Integrating the chatbot with a co-speech gesture generation system that can select appropriate gestures based on the conceptual meaning of the chatbot's speech. - Developing the overall pipeline leveraging various cloud services for functionality and efficiency.- Releasing the source code to enable implementation on different robot platforms.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that large language models can enhance human-robot interaction and conversational capabilities of robots, and the integration of LLMs with a gesture system adds visual expressivity. The paper presents a pipeline and examples to demonstrate the potential of this approach.
