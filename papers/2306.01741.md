# [GPT Models Meet Robotic Applications: Co-Speech Gesturing Chat System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01741)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research objective seems to be exploring ways of integrating recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT into practical robotic applications, specifically for developing highly responsive chatbot systems. The key ideas explored in the paper are:- Utilizing LLMs like GPT-3 and ChatGPT as the backend for a chatbot system to handle a wide range of conversational topics and contexts.- Integrating the chatbot with a co-speech gesture generation system that can select appropriate gestures based on the conceptual meaning of the chatbot's speech. - Developing the overall pipeline leveraging various cloud services for functionality and efficiency.- Releasing the source code to enable implementation on different robot platforms.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that large language models can enhance human-robot interaction and conversational capabilities of robots, and the integration of LLMs with a gesture system adds visual expressivity. The paper presents a pipeline and examples to demonstrate the potential of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a co-speech gesturing chat system that integrates large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT with a gesture engine to generate appropriate gestures synchronized with the speech. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Integrating LLMs as the backend for a conversational chatbot system to handle a wide range of topics naturally. Prompt engineering is used to adapt GPT-3 for conversation. - Connecting the LLM chatbot with a gesture engine that analyzes the chatbot's response and selects suitable co-speech gestures based on conceptual meaning. This adds expressive visual effects to the LLM's textual output.- Implementing the system on two robots - an in-house MSRAbot and the Toyota HSR robot. The Labanotation system is used for representing gestures in a robot-agnostic way.- Open sourcing the code to allow replication and extension of the work. This could benefit both chatbot and LLM research by providing a practical testbed.In summary, the main novelty is in combining recent advances in LLMs with multimodal gesture generation to create an expressive and capable conversational robot system. The open source release also enables follow-on research and applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces a chatting robot system that uses GPT-3/ChatGPT as the conversational backend and generates appropriate co-speech gestures based on the conceptual meaning of the chatbot's responses.
