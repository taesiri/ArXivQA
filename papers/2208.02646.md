## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve the dropout technique for self-attention layers in Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance their performance and generalizability? 

In particular, the paper focuses on analyzing and improving dropout for self-attention in ViTs from three main aspects:

1) What to drop in self-attention layers: The paper proposes dropping the Key instead of the attention weights, leading to a "dropout-before-softmax" scheme. 

2) How to schedule the dropout ratio: The paper proposes a decreasing schedule for the dropout ratio in successive layers rather than a constant ratio.

3) Whether structured dropout operations are needed: The paper experiments with structured block-wise and cross-wise dropout and finds they are not essential for ViTs.

Based on this analysis, the paper presents a new "DropKey" method that drops Keys with a decreasing schedule to improve generalization of ViTs across various architectures and tasks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that analyzing and improving dropout in these three aspects can enhance the performance and generalization of Vision Transformers. The experiments aim to validate the efficacy of the proposed DropKey technique.
