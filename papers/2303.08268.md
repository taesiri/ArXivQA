# Chat with the Environment: Interactive Multimodal Perception Using Large   Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can large language models (LLMs) be leveraged to enable robots to perform interactive multimodal perception and make reasonable decisions by examining objects to uncover their latent properties needed to complete a task?The key hypothesis appears to be that LLMs can provide high-level planning and reasoning skills to control interactive robot behavior in a multimodal environment, while multimodal perception modules help ground the LLMs in the environmental state and extend their processing capabilities.The paper develops an interactive perception framework with an LLM backbone that allows the robot to take epistemic actions to gather multimodal sensory information (vision, sound, haptics, proprioception) needed to resolve uncertainty and successfully execute instructed tasks. Experiments demonstrate the approach on an object picking task requiring the robot to uncover latent object properties through interactive perception guided by the LLM's reasoning.In summary, the central research question is how LLMs can enable robots to perform interactive multimodal perception for uncovering latent environmental properties needed for task completion. The key hypothesis is that the reasoning abilities of LLMs combined with multimodal perception modules can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It establishes a robot manipulation scenario with multimodal sensory data and language descriptions for interactive perception.2. It proposes Matcha, a multimodal interactive agent that uses an LLM backbone to "chat" with the environment. The LLM instructs epistemic actions to gather information, reasons over multimodal feedback, and plans task execution.  3. It demonstrates that LLMs can perform interactive multimodal perception and provide behavior explanations, enabling a robot to make reasonable decisions by examining objects to clarify latent properties needed to complete tasks.In summary, the key contribution is showing how LLMs can provide high-level planning and reasoning skills to control interactive robot behavior in a multimodal environment, while multimodal perception modules help ground the LLM. The framework is flexible and can scale to new actions, modalities, and scenarios.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an interactive multimodal perception framework called Matcha that uses a large language model to control a robot to actively gather information from its environment through different senses in order to uncover latent object properties and complete manipulation tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:- The paper focuses on using large language models (LLMs) for robotic planning and control. This is an emerging area of research as LLMs like GPT-3 show potential for few-shot instruction following and reasoning. The paper builds on recent work using LLMs for robotic planning, but extends it to interactive perception and grounding in multimodal sensory input.- A key novelty is the interactive perception framework that allows the LLM to "chat" with the environment, issuing commands to gather multimodal feedback, and using that to update its internal state representation and plan the next action. This sets it apart from prior LLM robotics work that operates in an open loop without environmental interaction.- The multimodal grounding through separate perception modules is important for connecting the LLM to real sensory inputs/outputs. The modular design makes the framework flexible and extensible to new modalities. Prior LLM robotics work has not focused as much on grounding in raw sensory data.- Using the LLM for behavior explanation after acting is an interesting capability that builds trust and interpretability. Most prior LLM robotics systems do not explain their reasoning process.- A limitation is the simplicity of the experimental scenario, with only a few object attributes and modalities. More complex real-world environments will pose challenges. The paper acknowledges the need for further work on multimodal LLMs and more dynamic vision-language grounding.- Overall, the interactive perception framework and multimodal grounding with modular components make important contributions. The experiments demonstrate promising capabilities for using LLMs to control robots that interactively gather information needed for tasks. More advanced LLM architectures can build on these ideas.
