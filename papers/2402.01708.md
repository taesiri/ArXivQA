# [Not My Voice! A Taxonomy of Ethical and Safety Harms of Speech   Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Speech generation systems pose significant ethical and safety risks to society, but evaluating and mitigating these risks is challenging since harms arise from complex interactions between human stakeholders and AI systems.  
- Existing taxonomies of AI risks categorize harms but don't explain how harms arise from stakeholder interactions. This knowledge is needed to effectively mitigate risks.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a conceptual framework for modeling pathways to AI harms based on "exposure" of affected entities (subject of, interacts with, suffers due to, excluded from AI) and "intent" of responsible entities (create or deploy AI to harm, harm due to creation or deployment).
- Use framework to develop taxonomy of harms from speech generators based on analysis of reported incidents. Taxonomy categorizes specific harms and connects them to affected/responsible entities.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptual framework to model pathways to harms showing how harms arise from interactions of stakeholders with AI systems. 
- Taxonomy of 35+ specific harms from speech generators, categorized by type of exposure of affected entity and intent of responsible entity.
- Analysis of reported incidents to demonstrate using taxonomy and framework to understand connections between stakeholders, systems, intents and harms.
- Taxonomy is extensible to new types of generative AI systems and provides a structured way to consider interventions based on modeling harm pathways.

In summary, the key innovation is the conceptual framework and taxonomy that together allow better modeling of how risks and harms arise in sociotechnical AI systems to support risk mitigation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a conceptual framework for modeling pathways to harms from AI systems like speech generators, uses it to develop a taxonomy of such harms, and demonstrates how the taxonomy can be used to understand risk patterns across incidents involving speech generators.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a conceptual framework for modeling pathways to ethical and safety harms of multimodal generative AI systems, and using this framework to develop a taxonomy of harms of speech generators. 

Specifically, the conceptual framework models pathways to AI harms based on:

- The exposure of affected entities, including whether they are the subject of, interact with, suffer due to, or are excluded from the AI system. 

- The intent of responsible entities in creating or deploying the AI system, including whether they intentionally create/deploy it to cause harm or if harm arises unintentionally due to their actions.

The taxonomy of harms of speech generators categorizes specific harms identified from reported incidents according to this conceptual framework. It captures the complexity of risks and harms in sociotechnical AI systems and provides an extensible scheme to support interventions and decision making around responsible development and deployment of speech generators.

In summary, the key contribution is providing both a conceptual model for understanding how harms arise from AI systems in context, as well as a practical taxonomy tailored to harms associated with speech generators.

The paper proposes a conceptual framework for modeling pathways to harms from speech generation systems. It develops a taxonomy of harms based on the exposure of affected entities (e.g. subject of, interacts with, suffers due to, excluded from) and the intents of responsible entities (e.g. creators, deployers). The taxonomy categorizes various specific harms, such as impersonation, identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, etc. The goal is to understand risks and harms arising from interactions between stakeholders and speech generation systems in order to develop responsible and ethical AI systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper uses a design science research approach to develop the conceptual framework and taxonomy iteratively. Why was this iterative approach chosen over developing them sequentially? What are the benefits of this approach?

2. Thirty-five incidents relating to speech generators were analyzed to develop the taxonomy. What process was used to identify these incidents from the various databases searched? What criteria were used to filter incidents? 

3. The conceptual framework models pathways to AI harms based on the exposure of affected entities and intent of responsible entities. How does modeling pathways help to understand and categorize harms compared to only categorizing harm types?

4. The taxonomy categorizes specific harms into types based on whether affected entities are the subject of, interact with, suffer due to or are excluded from speech generators. What is the rationale behind these exposure-based categories? How do they help to model pathways?

5. The taxonomy also categorizes harm motives based on whether responsible entities intentionally deploy AI to harm or if harm unintentionally arises from entertainment, profiteering, featurization etc motives. Why are both harmful intent and unintentional motives included? 

6. How extensible is the proposed taxonomy to new types of generative AI systems beyond speech generators? What changes would need to be made to the taxonomy to apply it to risks of large language models for example?

7. The paper argues that capability evaluations alone cannot identify and mitigate non-testable societal harms. What supplementary analyses are proposed to understand pathways to these harms? Why are these analyses important?

8. What process was used to map the identified specific harms to affected entity exposure types and responsible entity motives? Were there any harms that were difficult to map or categorize? 

9. How does the ability to visually map pathways between specific harms, affected entities and responsible entities help to identify common patterns between incidents?

10. What limitations does the taxonomy have in terms of completeness and categorization choices according to the paper? How can the taxonomy be iteratively expanded and refined over time?
