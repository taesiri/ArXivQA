# [Cross-lingual Offensive Language Detection: A Systematic Review of   Datasets, Transfer Approaches and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The growing prevalence of offensive language on social media platforms highlights the need for automated detection systems. However, building accurate multilingual detection models is challenging due to the diversity of languages and lack of labelled training data. Cross-lingual transfer learning (CLTL) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate these challenges by transferring knowledge from high-resource to low-resource languages. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey focused exclusively on CLTL techniques for offensive language detection. The authors systematically analyze 67 relevant papers across multiple dimensions:

- Characteristics of 82 multilingual offensive language datasets - Topics, data sources, languages, sizes, annotations, etc.

- Diverse cross-lingual linguistic resources utilized - Multilingual lexicons, parallel corpora, machine translation tools, multilingual representations from pre-trained models, etc.  

- Levels of CLTL techniques - Instance transfer, feature transfer, and parameter transfer:
   - Instance transfer: Transfer texts or labels between languages
   - Feature transfer: Transfer linguistic knowledge into a shared feature space  
   - Parameter transfer: Transfer model parameters across languages

- Specific CLTL strategies based on transfer levels - Translation, projection, multi-source and multi-channel learning, etc.

The survey also highlights key challenges (e.g. lack of data, cultural nuances) and suggests promising future directions.

Main Contributions:

- First systematic review focused exclusively on CLTL for offensive language detection (67 papers analyzed) 

- Comprehensive analysis of multilingual datasets, cross-lingual resources, diverse CLTL techniques and strategies

- Structured analysis of transfer techniques based on "what to transfer" 

- Identification of challenges and extensive discussion of future opportunities

- Valuable references and resources for researchers on multilingual datasets and CLTL methods

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions towards advancing research in automated cross-lingual offensive language detection through its systematic analysis and valuable insights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive overview of recent studies, challenges, and future research directions in using cross-lingual transfer learning techniques to detect offensive language online across diverse languages, analyzing 67 relevant papers on multilingual datasets, cross-lingual resources, transfer approaches on instance, feature and parameter levels with specific strategies, and open issues regarding languages, datasets, and methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing the first systematic and comprehensive survey focused specifically on cross-lingual transfer learning (CLTL) techniques for offensive language detection in social media. The key aspects of this contribution include:

1) Analyzing 67 relevant papers on cross-lingual offensive language detection, categorizing them across dimensions like datasets used, cross-lingual resources employed, and CLTL strategies implemented. 

2) Summarizing CLTL transfer approaches into three main categories - instance transfer, feature transfer, and parameter transfer - based on the level at which knowledge transfer occurs.

3) Discussing current challenges such as linguistic diversity, dataset scarcity, and model generalizability issues in cross-lingual offensive language detection.

4) Outlining promising future research directions in areas like dataset creation, incorporation of additional features, multilingual pre-trained language models, and application of large language models.

5) Making the survey resources available online, including two comprehensive tables summarizing the multilingual datasets and CLTL methods used in the literature to facilitate comparison and discovery.

In summary, this paper provides the first focused, systematic review of CLTL techniques for detecting offensive language across languages, analyzing prior work, elucidating techniques, summarizing challenges, and outlining opportunities to advance this important research area.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on cross-lingual offensive language detection:

1. What are the key differences between instance transfer, feature transfer, and parameter transfer as cross-lingual transfer approaches? What are some of the specific strategies used under each transfer approach?

2. The paper discusses annotation projection and pseudo-labeling as label-based instance transfer techniques. What are the relative advantages and limitations of these two techniques? Under what circumstances might one be preferred over the other?  

3. The paper highlights machine translation and text alignment as the two main text-based instance transfer techniques. What types of errors can arise from reliance on machine translation? When might text alignment be a more robust option?

4. What role do multilingual distributional and contextualized representations play in enabling feature transfer? What are some of the specific techniques and models used for this? 

5. The paper discusses zero-shot transfer, joint learning, and cascade learning as three parameter transfer scenarios. What are the key characteristics and differences between these scenarios? What strategies tend to be used under each?

6. When might multi-source training be an effective strategy for parameter transfer versus when might it fail or introduce detrimental effects? What considerations should guide multi-source training?

7. What are some of the relative strengths and weaknesses of meta learning strategies for few-shot cross-lingual learning versus other techniques like domain adaptation or ensemble learning?

8. What factors contribute to the superiority and widespread adoption of multilingual PLMs for cross-lingual offensive language detection? What limitations still persist?

9. What ethical concerns need to be considered when creating datasets for studying offensive language across different cultures and languages? How might datasets propagate biases?
