# [Neural Volumetric Memory for Visual Locomotion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01201)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- How can we enable legged robots to traverse complex terrains using only visual observations from an onboard camera? The paper focuses on the problem of locomotion using only vision, without other sensors providing detailed terrain information.- Can introducing explicit geometric priors and structure into the learning process lead to better visuomotor policies for locomotion? The authors propose a neural volumetric memory architecture that aggregates observations while accounting for camera pose changes, with the goal of encouraging equivariance and leading to better policies.- Does representing the surrounding scene geometry explicitly as a structured 3D volumetric memory provide benefits over simpler baselines like CNN feature extraction from images? The paper compares the proposed method against baselines without explicit geometric modeling.- Can a policy trained purely in simulation using the proposed architecture transfer successfully to a physical robot in complex real-world environments? The authors demonstrate sim-to-real transfer by deploying the trained policy on a physical quadrupedal robot.So in summary, the key hypotheses appear to revolve around using explicit geometric modeling and volumetric scene representations to enable visuomotor control for legged locomotion, with a focus on achieving sim-to-real transfer. The comparisons against baselines aim to validate the benefits of the proposed neural volumetric memory architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a novel neural volumetric memory (NVM) architecture for legged locomotion control using a forward-facing depth camera. The key ideas are:- NVM takes a sequence of depth images as input and aggregates them into a 3D feature volume representing the surrounding scene. - It explicitly models the SE(3) equivariance of the 3D world by estimating relative camera poses between frames and transforming/aligning the 3D features accordingly before aggregating. This allows integrating observations from different viewpoints into a coherent scene representation.- The model is trained with a two-stage pipeline. First a teacher policy is trained using privileged information like elevation maps. Then the NVM module and a visual policy are trained to mimic the teacher using only images, via behavior cloning and an additional self-supervised view reconstruction loss.- Experiments in simulated and real-world environments with stairs, gaps, and obstacles demonstrate that explicitly modeling 3D structure and equivariance enables superior visual locomotion compared to baselines. The method generalizes successfully from simulation to the real world.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the neural volumetric memory architecture that leverages 3D geometry and equivariance principles for learning visuomotor policies that succeed on complex terrains using only monocular images. The results highlight the importance of 3D reasoning for visual locomotion.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a neural volumetric memory (NVM) architecture that aggregates sequential visual observations from a depth camera into an equivariant 3D feature volume to enable a legged robot to traverse complex environments like stairs and gaps; experiments in simulation and on a real robot show NVM outperforms baselines without explicit 3D structure modeling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other related research:- The main contribution is proposing a novel neural volumetric memory (NVM) architecture for legged robot locomotion that better captures the 3D structure of the environment from ego-centric camera views. This builds on prior work in visuomotor control for legged robots by incorporating more explicit 3D reasoning.- Most prior visuomotor control methods for legged robots use some form of frame stacking or recurrent networks over 2D image features. This paper argues these approaches don't adequately capture the 3D structure and equivariance of the environment. The NVM module is designed to address this.- The idea of aggregating 3D feature volumes and using estimated camera pose transformations seems inspired by recent self-supervised 3D scene representation learning methods in computer vision like NeRF and neural volumes. The application to robot locomotion control is novel.- The two-stage training procedure of first training an elevation map policy then distilling to a visual policy is similar to other recent visuomotor learning papers. The main novelty is in the proposed NVM architecture used in the second stage.- Compared to blind locomotion policies, the inclusion of vision substantially expands the capabilities and robustness of the robot, especially for precise foothold and terrain reasoning. This is demonstrated through comparisons in complex simulated environments.- The real-world robot experiments help validate the effectiveness of NVM for sim-to-real transfer. Performance gains over baseline vision-based methods are shown across diverse terrain types.Overall, the paper makes nice connections between 3D scene understanding in computer vision and visuomotor control for legged robots. The proposed volumetric memory offers improvements over prior image-based methods by better handling 3D structure. The results demonstrate more capable real-world terrain locomotion.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more advanced neural network architectures for the 3D encoder and pose encoder in the neural volumetric memory module. The authors use relatively simple CNN and convolutional LSTM architectures in this work, but more advanced architectures like transformers could potentially improve performance.- Exploring different fusion methods for combining the transformed feature volumes in the neural volumetric memory. The authors use simple averaging in this work, but other options like attention-based fusion could be investigated. - Applying the neural volumetric memory idea to other visuomotor control tasks beyond legged locomotion, such as manipulation. The authors demonstrate it for locomotion in this paper, but the general concept could extend to other embodied AI settings.- Deploying the approach on more dynamic and unstructured real-world terrains. The authors test on several real-world settings, but evaluating on more diverse and challenging environments could further demonstrate the method's capabilities.- Investigating how to build longer-term memory by combining short-term neural volumetric memory with a secondary memory architecture. The current work focuses on short-term memory over a few seconds, but longer-term memory could also be useful.- Exploring whether neural volumetric memory can enable zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, without the need for the two-stage training procedure involving the elevation map policy. Removing this dependence on privileged information would be an interesting direction.In summary, the main future directions are around developing more advanced network architectures, testing the approach in more settings, combining it with longer-term memory, and investigating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Advancing the neural volumetric memory concept along these lines could further enhance visuomotor control for legged robots.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This CVPR 2023 paper template introduces a method for volumetric scene representation learning from 2D images to enable a legged robot to traverse complex environments using only a forward-facing depth camera. The method proposes a Neural Volumetric Memory (NVM) module that aggregates depth map observations over time into a 3D feature volume centered around the robot's current viewpoint. This allows implicitly fusing observations while accounting for camera motion to build a useful egocentric representation. The NVM module consists of a 2D-to-3D encoder to extract a 3D feature volume from each observation, a pose encoder to estimate camera motion between views, and adifferentiable grid-to-grid transformation that aligns and aggregates the volumes based on the estimated motion. Experiments in simulation and on a physical robot in real scenes with obstacles, gaps, and stairs demonstrate that explicitly modeling the 3D structure enables more effective locomotion compared to baselines. The approach follows a two-stage training pipeline, first using full state information then distilling the policy to use only images via the NVM. An additional self-supervised objective is introduced to encourage equivariance properties in the learned volumetric representation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel volumetric memory architecture for legged locomotion control using a single forward-facing depth camera. The key idea is to explicitly model the 3D geometry of the surrounding scene from the stream of ego-centric views. The architecture consists of a 2D to 3D feature volume encoder, and a pose estimator that estimates relative camera poses between frames. By combining these, the architecture forms a Neural Volumetric Memory (NVM) that aggregates features from multiple views into an equivariant latent space that accounts for camera motion. The NVM module is trained in simulation using a 2-stage pipeline. First a privileged policy using ground truth state information is trained with reinforcement learning to produce robust locomotion behaviors. Then the NVM module is trained using self-supervision and behavior cloning from the privileged policy. This results in a memory-equipped visuomotor policy that can operate directly on a physical quadruped robot. Experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate superior performance over baseline methods without explicit geometric priors. Ablation studies validate the importance of encoding 3D structure for locomotion in complex environments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel volumetric memory architecture called Neural Volumetric Memory (NVM) for legged locomotion control using a forward-facing depth camera. The NVM module takes as input a sequence of depth images and extracts 3D feature volumes for each one using a 3D encoder network. It also estimates the relative camera poses between frames using a pose estimation network. By applying the appropriate translation and rotation operations to the 3D volumes based on the estimated poses, NVM can transform and aggregate them into a single canonical egocentric frame. This allows it to build a coherent representation of the surrounding 3D structure that is equivariant to camera motion. The aggregated feature volume serves as a short-term memory that captures geometric details about terrain near the robot. For training, they first use RL with elevation maps to learn a privileged policy, then perform visuomotor distillation to transfer it to a student policy that takes the NVM as input. Experiments in simulation and on a real robot demonstrate that modeling the 3D structure explicitly enables superior performance on complex terrain compared to other baselines.
