# [Solving 3D Inverse Problems using Pre-trained 2D Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models to efficiently solve 3D inverse problems in medical imaging?Specifically, the authors aim to develop a method that can scale diffusion models to 3D while avoiding the prohibitively high memory/computation cost of modeling the full 3D space. Their key ideas are:1) Apply 2D diffusion models slice-by-slice in parallel along the z-axis. This avoids directly modeling the full 3D space.2) Augment the 2D diffusion prior with a model-based 3D prior (TV along z-axis) to impose consistency between slices. 3) Develop an efficient ADMM optimization strategy to integrate the diffusion model sampling with the 3D prior in a memory-efficient way.Overall, the central goal is to develop an approach that can achieve state-of-the-art 3D medical image reconstruction using only pre-trained 2D diffusion models, avoiding the need for costly 3D modeling or training directly on 3D volumes. The proposed DiffusionMBIR method aims to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called DiffusionMBIR for 3D medical image reconstruction using pre-trained 2D diffusion models. The key ideas are:- Combining model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) with diffusion model sampling to perform coherent 3D reconstructions from 2D models. - Augmenting the 2D diffusion model prior with a 3D total variation (TV) prior in the z-direction to impose coherence between slices.- An efficient implementation using "variable sharing" to minimize costly ADMM and conjugate gradient iterations.Specifically, the paper shows how to leverage powerful 2D diffusion models that can be trained with small datasets (<10 volumes) for 3D tasks like sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, and compressed sensing MRI. By augmenting the 2D prior with 3D TV regularization, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance even with very sparse measurements (e.g. 2-view CT). A key result is the high generalization capacity to out-of-distribution data.In summary, the main contribution is an effective way to scale 2D diffusion models to 3D medical imaging problems through a combination of data-driven and model-based priors. This establishes strong performance across applications with high fidelity, accuracy and surprising generalization ability.
