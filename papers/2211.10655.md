# [Solving 3D Inverse Problems using Pre-trained 2D Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10655)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models to efficiently solve 3D inverse problems in medical imaging?

Specifically, the authors aim to develop a method that can scale diffusion models to 3D while avoiding the prohibitively high memory/computation cost of modeling the full 3D space. Their key ideas are:

1) Apply 2D diffusion models slice-by-slice in parallel along the z-axis. This avoids directly modeling the full 3D space.

2) Augment the 2D diffusion prior with a model-based 3D prior (TV along z-axis) to impose consistency between slices. 

3) Develop an efficient ADMM optimization strategy to integrate the diffusion model sampling with the 3D prior in a memory-efficient way.

Overall, the central goal is to develop an approach that can achieve state-of-the-art 3D medical image reconstruction using only pre-trained 2D diffusion models, avoiding the need for costly 3D modeling or training directly on 3D volumes. The proposed DiffusionMBIR method aims to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called DiffusionMBIR for 3D medical image reconstruction using pre-trained 2D diffusion models. The key ideas are:

- Combining model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) with diffusion model sampling to perform coherent 3D reconstructions from 2D models. 

- Augmenting the 2D diffusion model prior with a 3D total variation (TV) prior in the z-direction to impose coherence between slices.

- An efficient implementation using "variable sharing" to minimize costly ADMM and conjugate gradient iterations.

Specifically, the paper shows how to leverage powerful 2D diffusion models that can be trained with small datasets (<10 volumes) for 3D tasks like sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, and compressed sensing MRI. By augmenting the 2D prior with 3D TV regularization, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance even with very sparse measurements (e.g. 2-view CT). A key result is the high generalization capacity to out-of-distribution data.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective way to scale 2D diffusion models to 3D medical imaging problems through a combination of data-driven and model-based priors. This establishes strong performance across applications with high fidelity, accuracy and surprising generalization ability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes combining 2D diffusion models with 3D model-based iterative reconstruction to enable memory-efficient and accurate 3D medical image reconstruction from sparse/limited measurements, achieving state-of-the-art results on tasks like sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, and compressed sensing MRI.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D medical image reconstruction:

- Using pre-trained 2D diffusion models for 3D reconstruction is a novel approach. Most prior work has focused on training 3D generative models directly, which is more computationally expensive. Leveraging 2D models is an efficient way to incorporate strong image priors into the 3D setting.

- Augmenting the diffusion model with a model-based (TV) prior specifically in the z-direction is clever. It allows enforcing inter-slice consistency while still relying primarily on the learned prior within each slice. Other papers tend to use generic 3D regularizers like isotropic TV rather than this directional approach.

- The method performs very well across multiple 3D modalities - sparse-view CT, limited angle CT, and compressed sensing MRI. Many recent papers focus on a single problem, whereas this demonstrates broader applicability. The results significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art in some cases, like 2-view CT reconstruction.

- The approach seems quite robust to out-of-distribution data, reconstructing very different phantom images well from limited data. This is an important consideration for real-world applicability. Some learning-based methods are highly data dependent.

- A limitation is that diffusion models are still computationally expensive compared to simpler learning priors based on CNNs. So the method may be slower than some alternatives, though the parallelization techniques proposed help mitigate this.

Overall, the paper introduces a conceptually simple but effective way to bring modern generative priors into 3D imaging. The experiments convincingly demonstrate state-of-the-art results across multiple important modalities while being robust. The approach helps overcome limitations of applying diffusion models directly in 3D.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Extending the method to other 3D inverse problems beyond CT and MRI, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or ultrasound imaging. The proposed framework of augmenting a 2D diffusion prior with a model-based 3D prior could potentially be applied to other modalities.

- Exploring different choices for the augmented prior beyond total variation (TV). The authors mainly focused on TV as the 3D prior, but suggest trying other regularization functions based on domain knowledge of each imaging modality.

- Training 3D diffusion models with efficient representations like point clouds or latent vectors. The authors discuss current limitations in scaling up the diffusion process to 3D due to memory constraints. Developing more efficient 3D generative models could help address this.

- Applying the framework to solve video and 4D reconstruction problems. The authors propose applying their method along the temporal dimension in addition to the spatial dimensions.

- Evaluating the method on a wider range of datasets, especially highly out-of-distribution examples. The authors showed promising generalization ability but suggest more rigorous evaluation across diverse data.

- Developing theoretical analysis to better understand the properties of combining data-driven diffusion models with model-based priors. For example, analyzing how the priors interact and affect reconstruction accuracy.

In summary, the main suggestions are around extending the approach to new modalities and data types, improving computational and memory efficiency for 3D, evaluating generalization more thoroughly, and developing theoretical grounding. The framework shows promising performance but there are many opportunities to build on it further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called DiffusionMBIR for 3D medical image reconstruction from limited/incomplete data measurements. The key idea is to leverage 2D diffusion models for image prior modeling and augment this with a model-based sparsity prior in the third dimension. Specifically, the 2D diffusion models are applied slice-by-slice to denoise the image. Then an ADMM update with a total variation (TV) penalty only on the z-direction is used to enforce consistency between slices. This combines the benefits of data-driven diffusion models and model-based TV regularization. Experiments on sparse-view CT, limited angle CT, and compressed sensing MRI show the method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality even from very limited measurements like 2-view CT. The method is also surprisingly robust to out-of-distribution test data. Overall, the proposed DiffusionMBIR approach enables high-quality 3D medical image reconstruction from 2D diffusion models in a computationally efficient manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called DiffusionMBIR for performing 3D medical image reconstruction tasks such as sparse-view tomography, limited angle tomography, and compressed sensing MRI. The key idea is to combine model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques with modern diffusion models for image generation. 

The authors leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model as a powerful prior for in-plane image generation. This generative prior is augmented with a model-based total variation (TV) prior in the out-of-plane direction to promote coherence across slices. An efficient optimization strategy called "variable sharing" is proposed to integrate the diffusion model sampling with a single Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) update per iteration. Experiments on sparse-view CT, limited angle CT, and compressed sensing MRI show state-of-the-art results, with accurate reconstructions even from very limited measurements like 2-view CT. The method also generalizes surprisingly well, reconstructing out-of-distribution test data. Overall, the proposed DiffusionMBIR approach combines the strengths of data-driven diffusion models and model-based TV regularization for highly effective 3D medical image reconstruction from minimal data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called DiffusionMBIR for 3D medical image reconstruction from 2D pre-trained diffusion models. The key idea is to leverage the power of diffusion models as generative priors while augmenting them with a model-based prior in the remaining dimension. Specifically, standard 2D diffusion models are used to denoise image slices independently. Then an ADMM optimization step is taken to enforce consistency across slices by minimizing a 3D TV term only in the remaining dimension. This elegantly combines the flexibility and realism of learned diffusion priors with the regularization benefits of model-based reconstruction. The diffusion model handles in-plane dependencies while the TV regularizer handles between-slice consistency. Experiments on sparse-view CT, limited angle CT, and compressed sensing MRI show state-of-the-art performance even on very challenging low data regimes like 2-view CT. The method is also surprisingly robust to out-of-distribution data. Overall, the paper presents an effective strategy to scale diffusion model priors to 3D imaging with minimal additional data requirements.

To summarize, the paper proposes an effective way to leverage 2D diffusion models to solve challenging 3D inverse problems in medical imaging while overcoming typical limitations of memory, computational complexity, and need for large 3D training datasets.
