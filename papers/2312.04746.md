# [Quilt-LLaVA: Visual Instruction Tuning by Extracting Localized   Narratives from Open-Source Histopathology Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) in histopathology requires examining multiple regions across the gigapixel images to compound evidence and reach a diagnosis. This poses challenges for histopathology chatbots to reason beyond a single patch.  
- Existing visual instruction datasets lack spatial grounding of image captions and contextual reasoning capability beyond an isolated image patch.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Quilt-Instruct, a dataset of 107K instructional question-answer pairs for histopathology images, extracted from narrated educational YouTube videos.
- The captions are grounded to image regions using automatically extracted mouse cursor movements of narrators. 
- Novel prompt strategies leverage supporting facts and diagnosis from full video content to guide GPT-4's reasoning, reducing hallucinations.

Key Contributions:
- Quilt-Instruct provides grounded and contextual histopathology instruction data 
- Train Quilt-LLaVA chatbot using Quilt-Instruct after initial alignment on Quilt dataset 
- Quilt-LLaVA shows spatial awareness in descriptions and can guide users on next steps towards diagnosis
- Evaluation on Quilt-VQA and public datasets shows Quilt-LLaVA significantly improves over prior histopathology chatbots

In summary, the paper introduces a grounded histopathology instruction dataset derived from educational videos to train a diagnostic reasoning chatbot called Quilt-LLaVA, outperforming prior arts in evaluations. The spatial grounding and contextual reasoning enables the chatbot to describe and reason about gigapixel WSIs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Quilt-LLaVA, a multi-modal chatbot for histopathology trained on Quilt-Instruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset derived from educational histopathology videos. Quilt-LLaVA leverages narrators' mouse cursor movements and contextual reasoning prompts to enable spatial grounding and diagnostic capabilities beyond single image patches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting:

1) Quilt-Instruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset of over 107,000 histopathology-specific question/answer pairs. It is generated by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube to obtain spatially grounded captions by extracting narrators' mouse movements. The paper also introduces novel instruction-tuning prompt strategies to reduce hallucinations - Complex Reasoning and Iterative Abductive Reasoning.

2) Quilt-LLaVA, a multi-modal chatbot trained using Quilt-Instruct. It significantly outperforms existing baselines on histopathology visual question answering datasets and reasoning-based evaluations using relative GPT-4 scoring. 

3) Quilt-VQA, an evaluation dataset of 1,283 human-generated question-answers curated from educational histopathology videos to assess chatbots' reasoning abilities.

In summary, the main contribution is creating instruction-tuning datasets for histopathology chatbots using videos, developing better prompting strategies to reduce hallucinations, training an improved chatbot Quilt-LLaVA, and proposing a new benchmark to evaluate reasoning skills. The results demonstrate the value of using videos and spatial grounding for instruction tuning in the medical domain.
