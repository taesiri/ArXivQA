# [Quilt-LLaVA: Visual Instruction Tuning by Extracting Localized   Narratives from Open-Source Histopathology Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) in histopathology requires examining multiple regions across the gigapixel images to compound evidence and reach a diagnosis. This poses challenges for histopathology chatbots to reason beyond a single patch.  
- Existing visual instruction datasets lack spatial grounding of image captions and contextual reasoning capability beyond an isolated image patch.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Quilt-Instruct, a dataset of 107K instructional question-answer pairs for histopathology images, extracted from narrated educational YouTube videos.
- The captions are grounded to image regions using automatically extracted mouse cursor movements of narrators. 
- Novel prompt strategies leverage supporting facts and diagnosis from full video content to guide GPT-4's reasoning, reducing hallucinations.

Key Contributions:
- Quilt-Instruct provides grounded and contextual histopathology instruction data 
- Train Quilt-LLaVA chatbot using Quilt-Instruct after initial alignment on Quilt dataset 
- Quilt-LLaVA shows spatial awareness in descriptions and can guide users on next steps towards diagnosis
- Evaluation on Quilt-VQA and public datasets shows Quilt-LLaVA significantly improves over prior histopathology chatbots

In summary, the paper introduces a grounded histopathology instruction dataset derived from educational videos to train a diagnostic reasoning chatbot called Quilt-LLaVA, outperforming prior arts in evaluations. The spatial grounding and contextual reasoning enables the chatbot to describe and reason about gigapixel WSIs.
