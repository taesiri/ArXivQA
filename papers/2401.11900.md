# [Showing Proofs, Assessing Difficulty with GeoGebra Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing automated reasoning tools in GeoGebra provide proofs of geometric statements, but don't show the details of the proof steps. This lacks transparency for users to validate the proofs.
- There is also no measure of the complexity or "interestingness" of geometric statements, to help identify more relevant discoveries.

Proposed Solutions:
1) Add a "ShowProof" command that displays the key proof steps:
- Shows translation of geometric input to algebraic equations
- Numerical specialization of free point coordinates 
- Addition of non-degeneracy conditions
- Expression of the thesis as a combination of hypotheses (direct proof) or expression of 1 as a combination of hypotheses + negation of thesis (proof by contradiction)

2) Propose a measure of statement "difficulty" based on:
- If the thesis is a sum of products of hypotheses polynomials -> more difficult
- If 1 is expressed as hypotheses + negation of thesis -> also more difficult
- Use higher degree of polynomials (syzygies) in these expressions to indicate more difficulty

Main Contributions:
- Improves visibility into automated geometric proofs for users
- Preliminary definition and examples of quantitative measure for difficulty/interestingness
- Basis for future research:
  - Analyze more complex statements and olympiad problems
  - Study impact of expression variations on difficulty
  - Connect complexity to ideal membership and deciding statement truth
  - Expand theoretical framework around the proposed metric

The key goals are to make automated geometric proofs more interpretable for users and develop an "interestingness" measure to identify more relevant statement discoveries. The paper lays groundwork and directions for extending research in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper describes new features in GeoGebra Discovery to visually display the proof steps and assess the difficulty of geometric statements, proposing degree of syzygies as a measure of complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents a new "ShowProof" command in GeoGebra Discovery that displays the sequence of steps and computations used to confirm the truth of a geometric statement. This allows users to visually see the proof instead of just getting a yes/no answer.

2) It proposes a measure of "interestingness" or complexity of geometric statements based on the degree of the polynomial syzygies that express the thesis as a combination of the hypotheses. Higher degree syzygies correspond to more complex/interesting statements. 

3) It provides several examples analyzing this proposed measure of complexity on different geometric statements, showing how it gives intuitive assessments of difficulty. For instance, basic midpoint properties are ranked as less interesting than deeper theorems like the concurrency of medians.

4) It discusses the motivation and relevance of visualizing automated proofs in geometry software and quantifying the complexity of discovered theorems, especially for educational purposes and in the context of machine learning systems that can automatically generate large amounts of geometric content.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing and demonstrating a new proof visualization tool and an initial proposal for an automated "interestingness" metric in GeoGebra Discovery.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Automated reasoning tools - The paper discusses automated reasoning tools and algorithms implemented in GeoGebra and GeoGebra Discovery for proving geometric statements.

- ShowProof command - A new command introduced to visualize and output the sequence of steps performed by GeoGebra Discovery to confirm a geometric statement. 

- Interestingness/complexity of theorems - The paper proposes ways to evaluate the difficulty or interest level of geometric statements, involving concepts like syzygies.

- Syzygies - Polynomial relations that express the thesis/conclusion as a combination of the hypotheses. Used to measure complexity. 

- Algebraic geometry algorithms - The automated reasoning tools rely on algebraic geometry algorithms and arithmetization to prove geometric statements.

- Geometric constructions - The paper analyzes the complexity of different geometric statements involving constructions like midpoints, intersection of lines, heights of triangles, etc.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "ShowProof" command to display the steps GeoGebra Discovery takes to prove a geometric statement. What are some ways this command could be enhanced to provide even more insight into the proof process? 

2. The paper introduces a complexity measure for geometric statements based on the degree of the syzygies used to express the statement's thesis in terms of its hypotheses. What are some potential issues or limitations with using syzygy degree as a complexity metric?

3. How does the complexity measure proposed relate to more traditional complexity measures for geometric constructions like the number of construction steps? What are the tradeoffs between these types of complexity measures?

4. The complexity measure is applied to some basic examples in the paper. What other more advanced geometry theorems could be good test cases to further analyze the potential of this complexity measure? 

5. The paper suggests specializing coordinate values as a way to potentially change statement complexity. How does specialization interact theoretically with the proposed complexity metric?

6. The paper mentions issues around expression equivalence that could impact complexity. How specifically could alternate but equivalent expression forms for hypotheses impact the resulting complexity measure?

7. What open questions remain around distinguishing statement complexity from proof complexity or associated ideal membership complexity? 

8. Can the notions of complexity and interestingness be further disentangled theoretically even though the paper relates them? What examples illustrate their divergence?  

9. What benchmarking remains to be done analyzing statement complexity for different theorem sets to further validate the proposed metric?

10. What software engineering work could connect the complexity measure to GeoGebra's existing automated geometric discovery capabilities to highlight the most interesting discovered statements?
