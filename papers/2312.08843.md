# [Diffusion-C: Unveiling the Generative Challenges of Diffusion Models   through Corrupted Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08843)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces "Diffusion-C," a methodology to analyze the generative limitations of diffusion models like DDPM, DDIM, and GANs by training them on visually corrupted data. Through experiments corrupting images with different noise types and intensities, they find DDPM performs the best while all models struggle with fog and fractal corruptions. They hypothesize susceptibility to these corruptions is influenced by topological/statistical similarities between the corruptions and models, particularly in mean and variance. Key observations are: (i) DDPM emerges as the top diffusion model, (ii) Fog and fractal corruptions significantly undermine DDPM and DDIM's robustness, (iii) Alignments in mean/variance greatly impact diffusion models' vulnerability. Diffusion-C elucidates diffusion models' constraints regarding corruptions, setting the stage for future generative model research. The approach validates propositions by empirically testing diffusion models' performance across diverse environments. The paper notes the need for new metrics tailored to assess novelty and performance on corrupted data versus only similarity to existing data.
