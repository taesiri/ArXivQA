# [Diffusion-C: Unveiling the Generative Challenges of Diffusion Models   through Corrupted Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08843)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces "Diffusion-C," a methodology to analyze the generative limitations of diffusion models like DDPM, DDIM, and GANs by training them on visually corrupted data. Through experiments corrupting images with different noise types and intensities, they find DDPM performs the best while all models struggle with fog and fractal corruptions. They hypothesize susceptibility to these corruptions is influenced by topological/statistical similarities between the corruptions and models, particularly in mean and variance. Key observations are: (i) DDPM emerges as the top diffusion model, (ii) Fog and fractal corruptions significantly undermine DDPM and DDIM's robustness, (iii) Alignments in mean/variance greatly impact diffusion models' vulnerability. Diffusion-C elucidates diffusion models' constraints regarding corruptions, setting the stage for future generative model research. The approach validates propositions by empirically testing diffusion models' performance across diverse environments. The paper notes the need for new metrics tailored to assess novelty and performance on corrupted data versus only similarity to existing data.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new methodology called "Diffusion-C" to analyze the generative limitations of diffusion models like DDPM, DDIM and GANs. 

Problem:
Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and corruptions. While previous work has studied this for discriminative models, there is limited understanding on how different corruptions affect the image generation capabilities of diffusion models. 

Proposed Solution - Diffusion-C:
1) Take an image dataset and corrupt it with different noise types (shot, impulse etc) and intensities. 
2) Train a diffusion model (DDPM/DDIM/GAN) on this corrupted dataset. 
3) Evaluate model performance using Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) between original and generated images.

By training the models on various corrupted datasets, the generative vulnerabilities of diffusion models can be effectively analyzed.

Key Results:
1) Among diffusion models, DDPM performs the best. DDIM trains faster but has slightly lower image quality.
2) Diffusion models are most vulnerable to fog and fractal corruptions. Their performance significantly degrades on these. 
3) The vulnerability seems to be caused by topological and statistical similarities between the corruptions and diffusion models.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes Diffusion-C, a new framework to evaluate generative robustness of diffusion models using corrupted datasets.
2) Provides analysis on which corruptions these models are most susceptible to and why.
3) Sets stage for future research to make diffusion models more robust to corruptions.

In summary, the key innovation is Diffusion-C and the detailed experimental analysis on how different corruptions affect image generation capability of diffusion models.
