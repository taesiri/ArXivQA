# [Diffusion-C: Unveiling the Generative Challenges of Diffusion Models   through Corrupted Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08843)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new methodology called "Diffusion-C" to analyze the generative limitations of diffusion models like DDPM, DDIM and GANs. 

Problem:
Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and corruptions. While previous work has studied this for discriminative models, there is limited understanding on how different corruptions affect the image generation capabilities of diffusion models. 

Proposed Solution - Diffusion-C:
1) Take an image dataset and corrupt it with different noise types (shot, impulse etc) and intensities. 
2) Train a diffusion model (DDPM/DDIM/GAN) on this corrupted dataset. 
3) Evaluate model performance using Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) between original and generated images.

By training the models on various corrupted datasets, the generative vulnerabilities of diffusion models can be effectively analyzed.

Key Results:
1) Among diffusion models, DDPM performs the best. DDIM trains faster but has slightly lower image quality.
2) Diffusion models are most vulnerable to fog and fractal corruptions. Their performance significantly degrades on these. 
3) The vulnerability seems to be caused by topological and statistical similarities between the corruptions and diffusion models.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes Diffusion-C, a new framework to evaluate generative robustness of diffusion models using corrupted datasets.
2) Provides analysis on which corruptions these models are most susceptible to and why.
3) Sets stage for future research to make diffusion models more robust to corruptions.

In summary, the key innovation is Diffusion-C and the detailed experimental analysis on how different corruptions affect image generation capability of diffusion models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents "Diffusion-C", a methodology to analyze the generative limitations of Diffusion Models like DDPM and DDIM by training them on visually corrupted data with different noise types and intensities to understand their performance vulnerabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing the Diffusion-C framework to analyze the generative limitations and vulnerabilities of diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM. Specifically:

1) They introduce the idea of corrupting the input data with different noise types and intensities to test how well diffusion models can still generate good quality outputs. This allows them to probe the models' robustness.

2) Through experiments using Diffusion-C, they find that DDPM performs the best among the diffusion models, and is notably vulnerable to fog and fractal corruptions. 

3) They show that the vulnerability of diffusion models to certain corruptions is influenced by topological and statistical similarities, especially the alignment between mean and variance.

4) They set the groundwork for future research to further understand the generative boundaries of diffusion models using adversarial/corrupted inputs, and suggest the need for new evaluation metrics beyond FID that measure generated novelty.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting Diffusion-C as a methodology to elucidate and benchmark the limitations of generative diffusion models.
