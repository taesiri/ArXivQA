## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "StyleDubber: Towards Multi-Scale Style Learning for Movie Dubbing":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of movie dubbing, also known as visual voice cloning (V2C). The goal is to convert a script into speech that aligns well with a video in terms of time, emotion, and voice style specified by a reference audio track. Existing V2C methods have issues with incomplete phoneme pronunciation leading to mumbled speech and poor identity stability over longer utterances. 

Solution:
The paper proposes StyleDubber, a model that learns speech style at both the phoneme and utterance levels, inspired by how humans perceive speech as a combination of factors like pronunciation habits and timbre. 

It contains three main components:
1) A multimodal phoneme-level adaptor (MPA) that captures pronunciation style from the reference audio and generates intermediate speech representations informed by facial emotion in the video.
2) An utterance-level style learning module that guides mel-spectrogram decoding and refining to improve overall style expression.  
3) A phoneme-guided lip aligner that synchronizes phonemes and lip motions to maintain lip sync.

Main Contributions:
- Learning adaptive speech style at both phoneme and utterance levels instead of just video frame level as in prior works. This enhances speech clarity and temporal alignment.
- A multimodal phoneme adaptor that imitates reference pronunciation style while considering visual emotion when generating intermediate speech representations.
- Synchronizing speech and video at the phoneme level instead of breaking phonemes across frame boundaries. This enables complete phoneme pronunciation. 
- State-of-the-art performance on V2C and GRID benchmarks under various settings like using non-ground truth reference audio.

In summary, the paper proposes a style-adaptive dubbing model with components to capture style at different scales and better align speech to lip motions, leading to more natural and identity-consistent dubbing.
