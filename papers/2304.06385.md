# [TransHP: Image Classification with Hierarchical Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06385)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: 

Whether injecting coarse-level class information as prompts into an intermediate layer of a vision transformer can improve hierarchical image classification, in a way that imitates how humans leverage hierarchical knowledge for visual recognition.

The key ideas/hypotheses appear to be:

- Humans use hierarchical taxonomic knowledge to aid visual recognition, by first recognizing a coarse category that narrows down the possibilities, then focusing on finer details to discriminate between related subcategories. 

- This process can be imitated in a vision transformer by dynamically injecting prompts representing ancestor classes into an intermediate layer, guiding the model to focus on relevant details to distinguish descendant classes.

- Conditioning the transformer in this way, termed "hierarchical prompting", will improve accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for hierarchical image classification compared to baseline transformers.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that hierarchical prompting, injecting coarse class prompts into a vision transformer, can enhance hierarchical image classification by mimicking the hierarchical reasoning process in human visual recognition. The experimental results then aim to validate whether this hierarchical prompting mechanism actually provides the expected benefits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel hierarchical prompting mechanism for image classification that exploits coarse-level (ancestor) information to help recognize fine-level (descendant) classes. 

2. It develops a Transformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP) that implements this idea by predicting the coarse class of an image using an intermediate block, and injecting a learned prompt token for that coarse class into the features to guide subsequent processing.

3. It shows that TransHP improves accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability of vision transformers on image classification benchmarks. For example, it improves top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 2.83% for ViT-B/16, and shows bigger gains when less training data is used.

4. It provides analysis and visualizations suggesting TransHP mimics aspects of human perception, first recognizing the coarse category and then focusing on discriminative details after being "prompted" with the coarse label.

5. It outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods for hierarchical image classification when using the same backbone, demonstrating the benefits of the prompting approach for exploiting hierarchy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evidencing the usefulness of hierarchical prompting in vision transformers for image classification, yielding gains in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. The prompting approach provides a new way to leverage hierarchical information that is inspired by human perception.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel hierarchical prompting mechanism for image classification called TransHP, which injects coarse-class prompts into an intermediate transformer block to dynamically focus the model on subtle differences between fine-grained descendant classes sharing the same ancestor.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on hierarchical image classification:

- The main novelty is the use of hierarchical prompting to exploit coarse-level semantic information. Prior works have used hierarchical labels in other ways, like cost matrices or embedding spaces, but this is the first to explore prompting.

- Most prior hierarchical classification methods are based on convolutional neural networks. This paper explores the benefit of hierarchical information for vision transformers, which have become quite popular recently.

- The hierarchical prompting mechanism is designed to mimic human recognition patterns, where coarse information helps focus attention on finer details. This biological inspiration sets it apart from purely technical approaches in prior works. 

- Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of hierarchical prompting, including improved accuracy, data efficiency, and explainability. Comparisons to recent state-of-the-art methods show it outperforms on several datasets.

- The technical approach injects coarse class prompts into intermediate layers of the transformer, allowing dynamic conditioning of feature extraction on the fly. This differs from typical prompting techniques that condition the entire model.

So in summary, the key novelty here is prompting, the application to transformers, mimicking human recognition, and demonstrating substantial improvements across multiple metrics and datasets. The results suggest hierarchical prompting is a promising direction for advancing hierarchical classification.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Extending TransHP to other vision tasks beyond image classification, such as semantic segmentation. The hierarchical prompting mechanism could be useful for these tasks as well.

- Exploring different ways to determine the optimal position to insert the prompting blocks in the transformer architecture for a given dataset and hierarchy structure. The authors currently use a qualitative principle but suggest more systematic analysis could help.

- Evaluating TransHP on larger and more complex hierarchical datasets. The authors tested on several image classification datasets but there may be opportunities to apply TransHP in domains with richer, deeper hierarchies.

- Investigating other ways prompt tokens could be learned and injected in the model. The authors propose a specific prompting block design but other architectures could be explored. 

- Applying the hierarchical prompting idea to other model architectures beyond transformers, like CNNs. The prompting mechanism need not be limited to transformers.

- Analyzing in more detail how the hierarchical prompting affects model attention and feature representations, to further understand why it improves accuracy and efficiency.

- Devising more systematic methods to construct hierarchical label sets for datasets that currently lack these annotations. The authors use existing labels but this limits experimentation.

- Exploring whether hierarchical prompting can improve robustness, fairness, and generalization of vision models. The authors focus on accuracy but prompting may impact other model properties.

In summary, the main future directions are applying TransHP more broadly across tasks, datasets, and models, and analyzing in more depth how hierarchical prompting benefits vision models. There are many opportunities to build on this initial work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes TransHP, a novel method to incorporate hierarchical labels into image classification using transformers. The key idea is to inject coarse-level class information into an intermediate layer of the transformer as prompt tokens. Specifically, TransHP learns a set of prompt tokens representing coarse classes and predicts the coarse class of an image using an intermediate block. It then injects the corresponding prompt token into the features to modify subsequent processing. This hierarchical prompting mimics how humans use coarse category information to focus on finer distinctions. Experiments on ImageNet and other datasets show TransHP improves accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability over baselines. The visualizations indicate TransHP takes a global view for coarse recognition initially but focuses on critical regions after prompting, similar to human perception. Compared to prior hierarchical classification methods, TransHP better utilizes the hierarchy through its novel prompting approach.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Transformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP) for hierarchical image classification. The key idea is to inject coarse-level semantic information into the model through learnable prompt tokens, in order to guide the model to focus on finer-grained details relevant for distinguishing between similar classes. 

Specifically, TransHP consists of multiple transformer blocks, with some blocks designated as "prompting blocks". These prompting blocks predict the coarse class of the input image, and insert the corresponding coarse class prompt token into the intermediate features. This prompts the model to attend to subtle differences between fine classes within that coarse class. Experiments on ImageNet and other datasets show TransHP improves accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability. The visualizations also show TransHP mimics human perception, first getting an overview of the image and then focusing on discriminative regions after being "prompted" with the coarse class. Overall, TransHP demonstrates explicitly injecting hierarchical semantic information as prompts is an effective approach for hierarchical image classification.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Transformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP) for hierarchical image classification. TransHP injects coarse-class information into an intermediate layer of a transformer backbone as prompt tokens. Specifically, it first learns a set of prompt tokens to represent the coarse classes in the label hierarchy. During inference, an intermediate block predicts the coarse class of the input image and selects the corresponding prompt token. This prompt token is then injected into the intermediate features. Although the model parameters stay the same, injecting the coarse-class prompt dynamically modifies the model to focus on subtle differences between fine classes under that coarse class. This hierarchical prompting imitates how humans recognize objects, by first recognizing the coarse category and then focusing on finer details. Through experiments on ImageNet and other datasets, TransHP is shown to improve accuracy, training efficiency, and model explainability compared to baseline transformers and other hierarchical classification methods. The key novelty is the hierarchical prompting mechanism which leverages coarse-class information to guide fine-grained classification.

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It proposes a new method called Transformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP) for hierarchical image classification (HIC). 

- The key idea is to inject coarse-level (ancestor) class information as prompt tokens into intermediate layers of a transformer. This mimics how humans use hierarchical knowledge to focus attention on subtle differences between fine-grained (descendant) classes.
