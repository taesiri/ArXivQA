# [R2Human: Real-Time 3D Human Appearance Rendering from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing photorealistic 3D human appearance from a single image is important for applications like holographic communication and immersive social experiences. However, existing methods either rely on complex multi-camera setups or are limited to offline processing, making real-time 3D human rendering from a single image an unsolved challenge. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes R^2Human, a novel framework that combines implicit texture fields and explicit neural rendering to achieve real-time inference and rendering of photorealistic 3D human appearance from a single RGB image. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Introduce a Z-map representation that collects depth values to form a 2D map, helping to lift 2D features to 3D while being compatible with 2D rendering CNNs. This resolves depth ambiguity issues in rendering.
(2) Employ Fourier Occupancy Fields (FOFs) to represent efficient 3D geometry as a prior for texture generation and sampling surface for rendering. This avoids expensive dense sampling. 
(3) An end-to-end network architecture consisting of - a geometry reconstruction network, a texture field encoder aligned with geometry, and a neural rendering network leveraging Z-map and other priors.

Main Contributions:

(1) First approach to generate full-body photorealistic 3D human appearance in real-time (24+ FPS) from only a single image input.

(2) Proposed R^2Human method combining strengths of implicit fields and explicit rendering, using novel Z-map representation to enable high fidelity visible region reconstruction and reliable occlusion region inference.

(3) State-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets, outperforming many offline methods as well. Enables practical applications in interactive holographic communication.

In summary, this paper makes significant advances towards enabling 3D immersive experiences by proposing an end-to-end deep learning approach for real-time photorealistic novel view synthesis of humans from just a single image.
