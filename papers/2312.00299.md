# [QIENet: Quantitative irradiance estimation network using recurrent   neural network based on satellite remote sensing data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00299)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a quantitative irradiance estimation network (QIENet) to estimate global horizontal irradiance (GHI) with high spatial resolution using Himawari-8 satellite data. QIENet utilizes a recurrent neural network architecture that incorporates both temporal features (through a recurrent unit) and spatial features (through convolution operations) of the satellite data. Additional inputs include time variables (hour, day, month) and geographic variables (altitude, longitude, latitude). Experiments show QIENet can effectively capture cloud impacts on GHI. Compared to widely-used datasets ERA5 and NSRDB, QIENet reduces RMSE by 27.51% and 18.00% respectively, while increasing the R^2 score. The estimated high resolution GHI database covers 13 provinces in southern China. By not overestimating ground observations, QIENet exhibits better accuracy than competing methods. The estimated solar energy distribution maps provide valuable information for renewable energy applications. Overall, this data-driven deep learning approach demonstrates strong potential for generating high-fidelity GHI estimates from satellite data.
