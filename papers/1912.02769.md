# [Infinite products and zero-one laws in categorical probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02769)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper develops the theory of Markov categories to treat infinite products and the Kolmogorov extension theorem. The main contributions are:

- It introduces infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories, which generalize infinite products. This implements the Kolmogorov extension theorem synthetically.

- It defines Kolmogorov products, which are infinite tensor products in Markov categories that are compatible with the copying operations. These model collections of infinitely many random variables.

- It proves abstract versions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage zero-one laws using the framework of Markov categories and Kolmogorov products. These generalize the classical probabilistic zero-one laws. 

- It shows how the abstract zero-one laws instantiate to recover the classical ones when applied to the category of standard Borel spaces.

- It gives another application of the Kolmogorov zero-one law in the Kleisli category of the Vietoris monad, obtaining a theorem about when continuous maps out of infinite products of spaces are constant.

In summary, the paper expands the synthetic understanding of probability theory using categorical concepts like infinite limits and Markov categories. The zero-one laws are framed abstractly and then shown to recover the classical results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on skimming the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

This paper develops infinite tensor products and the Kolmogorov extension theorem in the abstract setting of Markov categories, and uses this to prove general versions of the zero-one laws of Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage that apply not only to probability theory but also more broadly.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper relates to other research on categorical probability:

- It builds directly on the work of Fritz and others in developing "Markov categories" as a categorical framework for probability theory. The concepts like Kolmogorov products are extensions of that theory.

- The zero-one laws have been considered category-theoretically before, but mainly in more specialized settings like tensor C*-categories. This paper gives general versions that work in any Markov category.

- The examples show connections to other categorical probability research. Relating Markov categories to the Giry monad and Kleisli categories of the Vietoris monad connects this approach to other monad-based frameworks.

- The paper aims to further demonstrate the viability and applicability of the Markov category approach by proving fundamental theorems and investigating key examples. In that sense it is continuing an research program to establish Markov categories as a foundational framework.

- Compared to more traditional probability theory, the categorical approach is more abstract and syntactic. The gain is in identifying structures and concepts independent of measure theory specifically. This allows for applications beyond standard probability spaces.

- Open questions are highlighted, like finding more examples of causal Markov categories with infinite products. This indicates directions for future research to further develop the theory.

In summary, this paper builds on existing categorical probability research, especially the Markov category framework, and makes technical contributions around infinite products and zero-one laws. It relates this approach to other monad-based ones and aims to further establish Markov categories as a foundation for probability theory in the categorical vein.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential directions for future research:

- Developing a notion of "compact Markov kernel" or "perfect Markov kernel" to find a subcategory of $\Stoch$ larger than $\BorelStoch$ that still has all infinite tensor products. This is related to open problems regarding the Kolmogorov extension theorem.

- Finding an interesting causal Markov category with all Kolmogorov products, to instantiate the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law. So far the only examples are cartesian monoidal categories or finitary complete monoids. 

- Applying the abstract zero-one laws to other Markov categories besides $\BorelStoch$ to obtain new results, such as topological or order-theoretic analogues.

- Developing further aspects of probability theory, such as convergence theorems, within the framework of Markov categories.

- Investigating connections to quantum theory, such as using Markov categories to model quantum measurements or finding quantum analogues of the zero-one laws.

- Exploring applications of Markov categories in other fields such as statistics, information theory, economics, etc.

In summary, the main directions are: finding broader Markov categories with nice properties, applying the existing theory to new examples, and developing more of probability theory synthetically using the Markov category framework. The potential for applications outside probability theory is also highlighted.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops the theory of infinite tensor products and Kolmogorov products in the context of Markov categories, which provide an abstract categorical framework for probability theory. The authors define infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories, discuss examples including the category of standard Borel spaces where they implement the Kolmogorov extension theorem, and show these compose nicely. They then impose additional compatibility conditions between infinite tensor products and the comonoid structure to define Kolmogorov products in Markov categories. As an application, they state and prove categorical versions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage zero-one laws, which give general criteria for when certain events or statistics depending on infinite collections of independent random variables must have probability 0 or 1. They show these abstract versions specialize to the classical zero-one laws when applied to the category of standard Borel spaces.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops infinite tensor products and the Kolmogorov extension theorem in the context of Markov categories, which provide a categorical foundation for probability theory. After reviewing background on Markov categories, the authors define infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories. They discuss examples where these exist, such as in the category of standard Borel spaces, where infinite tensor products implement the Kolmogorov extension theorem. 

The authors then define Kolmogorov products, which are infinite tensor products in Markov categories that respect the additional structure. Using these notions, they state and prove general categorical versions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage zero-one laws. These results specialize to the classical zero-one laws when applied to the category of standard Borel spaces. The authors also give another application in the Kleisli category of the lower Vietoris monad. Overall, this provides further evidence that Markov categories appropriately capture probabilistic concepts and theorems in abstract categorical terms.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces infinite tensor products and Kolmogorov products in the setting of Markov categories. The main method is to define infinite tensor products as cofiltered limits of finite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories, and then impose an additional condition for Kolmogorov products that the projections are deterministic morphisms. This allows stating and proving abstract versions of Kolmogorov's and Hewitt-Savage's zero-one laws, which are shown to specialize to the classical results when instantiated in the category of standard Borel spaces. The key idea is that the Kolmogorov extension theorem, which reconstructs a joint distribution from its finite marginals, becomes a definition in the framework of Markov categories. Overall, the paper develops probability theory with infinitely many random variables in the abstract setting of Markov categories using categorical limit constructions.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper studies infinite tensor products and zero-one laws in the context of Markov categories. The main contributions are:

1. Defining infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories, motivated by the Kolmogorov extension theorem. A preservation condition is imposed to ensure good compositionality properties. Examples are discussed.

2. Defining Kolmogorov products, a stronger notion of infinite tensor product in Markov categories which respects the copying structure. It is shown that Kolmogorov products are categorical products in the deterministic subcategory.

3. Stating and proving abstract versions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage zero-one laws using the framework of Kolmogorov products. The hypotheses directly mirror the measure-theoretic assumptions.

4. Instantiating the results in the category of standard Borel spaces to recover the classical zero-one laws. An additional application to continuous maps between topological spaces is given.

In summary, the paper develops the theory of infinite tensor products and zero-one laws in Markov categories, demonstrating that key results from probability theory can be stated and proven abstractly in this categorical setting. The main novelty is a general framework for zero-one laws based on Kolmogorov products.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing infinite tensor products and zero-one laws in categorical probability. Some key points:

- It develops a notion of infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories, which includes examples like stochastic matrices, measurable spaces, rings, etc. This generalizes the usual notion of infinite products.

- A more restrictive notion of "Kolmogorov product" is defined for Markov categories, which respects the copying structure. These implement the Kolmogorov extension theorem.

- Versions of the zero-one laws of Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage are stated and proven abstractly using the framework of Markov categories and Kolmogorov products. 

- When applied to the category of standard Borel spaces, these abstract zero-one laws specialize to the usual measure-theoretic versions.

- Other examples are discussed, like topological spaces and multivalued functions on sets. An open problem is posed to find more examples of causal Markov categories with infinite products.

In summary, the paper develops the theory of infinite tensor products and zero-one laws in the abstract categorical probability setting of Markov categories. This provides a unified framework to state and prove general versions of classical probability theorems.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 This paper introduces infinite tensor products and Kolmogorov products in the context of Markov categories. It defines infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories as cofiltered limits that are preserved by tensoring. Kolmogorov products are defined as infinite tensor products in Markov categories where the finite marginalization maps are deterministic. The paper shows that Kolmogorov products compose nicely. It then proves abstract versions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage zero-one laws, requiring the Markov category to be causal in the latter case. Finally, it instantiates these results in the Markov category of standard Borel spaces to recover the classical zero-one laws, and also gives an application to continuous maps out of infinite products of topological spaces. The overall contribution is a framework for stating and proving fundamental results of probability theory involving infinite collections of random variables in the abstract setting of Markov categories.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper develops a categorical framework for infinite products and zero-one laws in probability theory. It introduces the notion of infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories, which generalizes the idea of the Kolmogorov extension theorem. In Markov categories, a stronger notion of Kolmogorov product is defined that respects the copying structure. 

Using this framework, the paper proves abstract versions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage zero-one laws. These apply very generally in Markov categories and specialize to the classical laws when applied to the category of standard Borel spaces. Additional examples are given, including an application to continuous maps between topological spaces.

Overall, the paper makes significant progress in developing probability theory synthetically using category theory. It demonstrates how fundamental results like the zero-one laws can be formulated and proven abstractly in the language of Markov categories. This provides a conceptual understanding separate from the technical measure-theoretic details. The framework also allows instantiating the general theorems in new settings beyond standard probability theory.
