# [Infinite products and zero-one laws in categorical probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02769)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper develops the theory of Markov categories to treat infinite products and the Kolmogorov extension theorem. The main contributions are:- It introduces infinite tensor products in semicartesian symmetric monoidal categories, which generalize infinite products. This implements the Kolmogorov extension theorem synthetically.- It defines Kolmogorov products, which are infinite tensor products in Markov categories that are compatible with the copying operations. These model collections of infinitely many random variables.- It proves abstract versions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage zero-one laws using the framework of Markov categories and Kolmogorov products. These generalize the classical probabilistic zero-one laws. - It shows how the abstract zero-one laws instantiate to recover the classical ones when applied to the category of standard Borel spaces.- It gives another application of the Kolmogorov zero-one law in the Kleisli category of the Vietoris monad, obtaining a theorem about when continuous maps out of infinite products of spaces are constant.In summary, the paper expands the synthetic understanding of probability theory using categorical concepts like infinite limits and Markov categories. The zero-one laws are framed abstractly and then shown to recover the classical results.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on skimming the paper, here is a one sentence summary:This paper develops infinite tensor products and the Kolmogorov extension theorem in the abstract setting of Markov categories, and uses this to prove general versions of the zero-one laws of Kolmogorov and Hewitt-Savage that apply not only to probability theory but also more broadly.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper relates to other research on categorical probability:- It builds directly on the work of Fritz and others in developing "Markov categories" as a categorical framework for probability theory. The concepts like Kolmogorov products are extensions of that theory.- The zero-one laws have been considered category-theoretically before, but mainly in more specialized settings like tensor C*-categories. This paper gives general versions that work in any Markov category.- The examples show connections to other categorical probability research. Relating Markov categories to the Giry monad and Kleisli categories of the Vietoris monad connects this approach to other monad-based frameworks.- The paper aims to further demonstrate the viability and applicability of the Markov category approach by proving fundamental theorems and investigating key examples. In that sense it is continuing an research program to establish Markov categories as a foundational framework.- Compared to more traditional probability theory, the categorical approach is more abstract and syntactic. The gain is in identifying structures and concepts independent of measure theory specifically. This allows for applications beyond standard probability spaces.- Open questions are highlighted, like finding more examples of causal Markov categories with infinite products. This indicates directions for future research to further develop the theory.In summary, this paper builds on existing categorical probability research, especially the Markov category framework, and makes technical contributions around infinite products and zero-one laws. It relates this approach to other monad-based ones and aims to further establish Markov categories as a foundation for probability theory in the categorical vein.
