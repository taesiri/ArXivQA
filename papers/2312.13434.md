# [Zero-1-to-3: Domain-level Zero-shot Cognitive Diagnosis via One Batch of   Early-bird Students towards Three Diagnostic Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13434)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of domain-level zero-shot cognitive diagnosis (DZCD). This challenge arises when an online education platform launches a new learning topic (domain) with a fresh question bank, resulting in very limited practice records from early-bird learners and unavailable logs for most unseen students. Traditional cognitive diagnosis models fail in such scenarios due to the absence of student practice logs for model training. Recent cross-domain methods have been proposed but they transfer non-essential information across domains which limits performance.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Zero-1-to-3, a framework for DZCD via one batch of early-bird students towards three diagnostic objectives: (1) being diagnosis-oriented to effectively estimate student states; (2) enabling cognitive signal propagation by extracting domain-shared states for transfer; (3) being domain-adaptive by using early-bird logs. 

Specifically, it first pre-trains a model with dual regularizers to decouple student states into domain-shared (transferable) and domain-specific (non-transferable) parts. Then the domain-shared states are transferred to the new domain as initialization. Next, simulated logs are generated for unseen students by analyzing early-bird logs and assigning records of similar early-bird students. Finally, unseen student states are fine-tuned using the simulated logs to fulfill diagnosis.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies the key challenge of "what to transfer" in cross-domain diagnosis and proposes cognitive state decoupling to extract transferable (domain-shared) signals.
- Designs a domain-adaptive strategy to simulate logs for cold-start students by fully exploiting early-bird logs, instead of ignoring domain-specific information.
- Extensive experiments prove the efficacy of Zero-1-to-3 for zero-shot diagnosis, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
- Demonstrates the application of cognitive diagnosis to personalized question recommendation even in cold-start scenarios.
