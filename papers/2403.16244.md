## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a large-scale synthetic dataset generator called M3Act for multi-person and multi-group human motions and activities. The key problem it aims to address is the lack of real-world data for tasks involving interactions between multiple people, such as multi-person tracking, group activity recognition, and controllable generation of collective motions. 

The paper proposes a highly configurable synthetic data generator called M3Act Data Generator (M3Act-DG) to procedurally create photorealistic and massive-scale data of human groups. M3Act-DG simulates 14 categories of single-group activities such as talking, queueing, walking, running, and dancing, as well as complex multi-group scenarios with heterogeneous combinations of these activities. It incorporates a high degree of randomization and a novel collision avoidance algorithm to increase diversity. Two large-scale synthetic datasets are produced: M3ActRGB with 15K videos and M3Act3D with 65K clips of skeletal motions, capturing diverse collective human behaviors.

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this synthetic data on three multi-person tasks: (1) Multi-person tracking: M3ActRGB data enhances a SOTA tracker resulting in state-of-the-art performance on a real dancing dataset using only 37.5% of real data. (2) Group activity recognition: pretraining on M3Act3D leads to faster convergence and better accuracy on a real group activity dataset. (3) Controllable generation of collective motions: an interaction-aware generative model conditioned on activity labels generates higher-quality and more diverse group motions than baseline models.

The main contributions are: (1) Highly configurable, photorealistic and large-scale synthetic dataset generator for multi-person interactions; (2) State-of-the-art results by augmenting real data with synthetic data on tracking and activity recognition; (3) Controllable generation of diverse collective human motions. Limitations and societal impacts are also analyzed.
