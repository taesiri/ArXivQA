## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a large-scale synthetic dataset generator called M3Act for multi-person and multi-group human motions and activities. The key problem it aims to address is the lack of real-world data for tasks involving interactions between multiple people, such as multi-person tracking, group activity recognition, and controllable generation of collective motions. 

The paper proposes a highly configurable synthetic data generator called M3Act Data Generator (M3Act-DG) to procedurally create photorealistic and massive-scale data of human groups. M3Act-DG simulates 14 categories of single-group activities such as talking, queueing, walking, running, and dancing, as well as complex multi-group scenarios with heterogeneous combinations of these activities. It incorporates a high degree of randomization and a novel collision avoidance algorithm to increase diversity. Two large-scale synthetic datasets are produced: M3ActRGB with 15K videos and M3Act3D with 65K clips of skeletal motions, capturing diverse collective human behaviors.

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this synthetic data on three multi-person tasks: (1) Multi-person tracking: M3ActRGB data enhances a SOTA tracker resulting in state-of-the-art performance on a real dancing dataset using only 37.5% of real data. (2) Group activity recognition: pretraining on M3Act3D leads to faster convergence and better accuracy on a real group activity dataset. (3) Controllable generation of collective motions: an interaction-aware generative model conditioned on activity labels generates higher-quality and more diverse group motions than baseline models.

The main contributions are: (1) Highly configurable, photorealistic and large-scale synthetic dataset generator for multi-person interactions; (2) State-of-the-art results by augmenting real data with synthetic data on tracking and activity recognition; (3) Controllable generation of diverse collective human motions. Limitations and societal impacts are also analyzed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides supplementary details on the data generator, datasets, experiments, additional results, limitations, and future work related to the M3Act synthetic data generator for animating realistic multi-person motions and interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a data generator called "M3Act" for creating large-scale, diverse synthetic data of human motions and activities in both 2D and 3D. Specifically:

- They propose a highly configurable data generator called "M3Act" that can simulate a wide range of single-group and multi-group human activities with domain randomization. This enables generating massive and diverse synthetic tracking and activity recognition datasets.

- They create two large-scale synthetic datasets with this generator: "M3ActRGB" containing 2D images/videos and "M3Act3D" containing 3D motion data. M3ActRGB has 15K videos with 54M bounding boxes, while M3Act3D has 65K clips totaling 87.6 hours.

- They demonstrate the usefulness of this synthetic data by showing significant performance improvements when using it for pre-training on various multi-person understanding tasks like tracking, 2D/3D activity recognition, and controllable generation of group activities.

- Their experiments show the proposed synthetic data can replace 60-80% of real data on tracking and lead to up to 6.8x faster convergence for activity recognition models.

In summary, the main contribution is the M3Act data generator and the large-scale diverse synthetic datasets created using it to advance multi-person perception with limited real-world data.
