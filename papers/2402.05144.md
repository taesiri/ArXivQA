# [A Bandit Approach with Evolutionary Operators for Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05144)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of model selection, where the goal is to automatically find the best machine learning model for a given task from a potentially infinite set of model configurations. This is a challenging problem since the space of possible models can be extremely large and evaluating each model requires substantial computational resources. 

The paper formulates this as an "infinite-armed bandit" problem, where each model configuration is an "arm", pulling an arm means training the model, and the reward is the accuracy of the model on a validation set. The goal is to efficiently explore the space of models to find the best one within a computational budget constraint.

Proposed Solution:
The paper first proposes an algorithm called ∞-UCB-E, which extends the UCB-E bandit algorithm to handle an infinite number of arms. This allows exploring an unbounded space of models. Under some assumptions, the paper shows this algorithm achieves sublinear regret.

The main algorithm is called Mutant-UCB. It incorporates evolutionary algorithm concepts into the ∞-UCB-E algorithm. Specifically, when selecting a model to train, with some probability a "mutation" operator is applied to generate a slightly modified version, which is then trained. This allows efficiently exploring model configurations close to high performing ones. Mutant-UCB also limits the number of training iterations per model.

Contributions:

- Formulates model selection as an infinite-armed bandit problem, allowing exploration of a very large search space
- Proposes ∞-UCB-E algorithm and analyzes its regret
- Develops Mutant-UCB algorithm combining bandits and evolutionary approaches 
- Mutant-UCB is flexible - makes no assumptions about search space structure or smoothness 
- Experiments on neural architecture search show Mutant-UCB outperforms baselines like random search and Hyperband

The main novelty is efficiently exploring an infinite search space by integrating evolutionary mutation operators into a bandit algorithm. This is shown empirically to improve performance over state-of-the-art techniques.
