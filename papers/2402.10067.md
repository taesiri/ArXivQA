# [LLM-based policy generation for intent-based management of applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10067)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Automated management of distributed applications and infrastructure is challenging due to the need to translate high-level user intents into low-level configurations and actions. This requires decomposing intents into ordered steps that can adapt to changing conditions. Pre-defining these steps is difficult. 

Solution: 
The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning to progressively decompose user intents into policies that can be executed to realize the intents. The policies represent a sequence of monitor, analyze, plan and execute actions based on a policy framework. 

The proposed system has a 3-stage pipeline:
1) Classify incoming intents into known intent types 
2) Progressively decompose intents into policies by generating a policy, executing it, and using the result to determine next policy
3) Validate the generated policies 

Policies are then mapped to APIs and executed. Feedback control loops couple the policies to enable intent fulfillment and assurance.

Main Contributions:
- Propose using LLMs for progressive intent decomposition into policies, enabling automation
- Evaluate system on a cloud testbed for intent fulfillment and assurance
- Show LLMs can generalize and adapt to new, unseen intents due to few-shot learning
- Discuss opportunities of using LLMs for additional tasks like creating dynamic finite state machines

The results demonstrate that generic LLMs are promising for intent-based application management by automatically determining the steps required to meet intents.
