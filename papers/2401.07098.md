# [A Novel Multi-Stage Prompting Approach for Language Agnostic MCQ   Generation using GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07098)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are important for assessing knowledge but manually creating high-quality MCQs is challenging and time-consuming.  
- There is limited research on using state-of-the-art GPT models like text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 for prompting-based MCQ generation, especially in multilingual settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a multi-stage prompting (MSP) approach that guides the GPT model through four key stages - paraphrasing, keyword extraction, question generation, and distractor generation - to create well-formed MCQs.  
- They introduce the idea of "chain-of-thought" prompting to encourage iterative reasoning and reflection in the model during the MCQ generation process.
- The approach is evaluated in a zero-shot setting and a one-shot learning setting to boost performance. 
- It is tested on high-resource languages (English, German) as well as low-resource languages (Hindi, Bengali) to showcase language agnostic capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates GPT models can generate high-quality MCQs without fine-tuning by using prompting strategies.
- Shows the MSP approach outperforms a single-stage prompting baseline in automated and human evaluations.  
- The one-shot learning setting further improves multilingual MCQ quality over zero-shot for low resource languages.
- Provides an effective prompting framework for MCQ generation that works across multiple languages.

In summary, the key novelty is using iterative prompt design to unlock GPT's ability to create good MCQs in diverse languages without needing extra training data. The step-by-step methodology is broadly applicable.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a multi-stage prompting approach using GPT models to generate high-quality, diverse, and language-agnostic multiple choice questions across English, German, Hindi, and Bengali.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose a multi-stage prompting (MSP) approach for generating multiple choice questions (MCQs) using GPT models like text-davinci-003 and GPT-4. The MSP approach incorporates the concept of "chain-of-thought" prompting to guide the MCQ generation process through four stages: paraphrase generation, keyword extraction, question generation, and distractor generation.

2) The authors demonstrate the superiority of their proposed MSP method over a baseline single-stage prompting (SSP) approach through automated evaluations, resulting in higher quality distractor generation. The one-shot MSP technique further enhances these results.

3) The MSP approach enables MCQ generation in multiple languages including English, German, Bengali and Hindi. Human evaluations show the generated questions have improved grammaticality, answerability and difficulty across languages.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a novel multi-stage prompting technique to generate high quality, diverse and language-agnostic MCQs using state-of-the-art GPT models.

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper include:

- Multiple choice question (MCQ) generation
- Multi-stage prompting (MSP) 
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
- GPT models (text-davinci-003, GPT-4)
- Zero-shot learning
- One-shot learning

The paper proposes a multi-stage prompting approach using GPT models like text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 to generate multiple choice questions in multiple languages, including low-resource languages like Hindi and Bengali. It leverages the chain-of-thought prompting technique to guide the GPT models through sequential reasoning steps to produce better MCQs. Both automated and human evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach over a single-stage prompting baseline.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a multi-stage prompting (MSP) approach for MCQ generation. Can you explain in detail the four main stages of this approach and how they guide the GPT model to generate better MCQs?

2. The concept of "chain-of-thought" (CoT) prompting is utilized in the proposed method. How does this concept help in incorporating human-like reasoning into the GPT models for generating high-quality MCQs?

3. The paper compares the proposed MSP approach with a single-stage prompting (SSP) baseline. What were the key differences observed between MSP and SSP in the automatic and human evaluations?

4. The one-shot learning technique is also explored for MCQ generation in the paper. How does providing one example to the GPT model in the prompt help enhance the quality of generated questions and distractors?

5. The authors test their approach on both high-resource (English, German) and low-resource (Hindi, Bengali) languages. What differences did you observe between the results of these two sets of languages? What could be the potential reasons?

6. Apart from the overall quality, what other criteria were used to evaluate the generated multiple choice questions during human evaluation? Can you explain the rating scale used?

7. The paper focuses solely on leveraging the capabilities of GPT models for MCQ generation and does not fine-tune them. Do you think fine-tuning could have led to better performance? Why or why not?

8. How effective was the proposed approach in ensuring diversity in the generated questions for a given context? Could the paraphrasing stage be improved further?

9. The paper does not compare GPT performance with other state-of-the-art MCQ generation techniques. In your opinion, how would it fare against methods based on T5 or BART?

10. The authors mention scope for future work on improving results for low-resource languages. What specific techniques could help address this gap with high-resource languages?
