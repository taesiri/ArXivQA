# [An analysis of the L1 Scheme for the subdiffusion equation with   nonsmooth data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.0253)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research contributions are:

1. The introduction of a new dataset called the Movie Description dataset, which contains transcribed and aligned audio descriptions (DVS) as well as movie scripts for 72 full-length HD movies. This dataset allows for multi-sentence video description and understanding stories/plots across sentences in an open-domain scenario at large scale, which was not possible with previous video description datasets.

2. A characterization and benchmarking of different approaches for generating video descriptions on this new dataset. The main approaches compared are: nearest neighbor retrieval, an adaptation of the translation model from Rohrbach et al. (2013) using automatically extracted semantic representations, and a translation model using visual word labels.

3. A method for semi-automatically collecting and aligning DVS data from audio tracks.

4. An analysis comparing DVS and movie scripts as sources of descriptions. Through human evaluation, they find DVS to be more visually relevant and correct than movie scripts.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that this new large-scale, open-domain dataset of DVS and movie scripts will enable new research in video understanding, including multi-sentence video description, story/plot understanding, and characterizing how different models perform on the task of video description. The authors support this viaintroducing the dataset, benchmarking existing methods, and analyzing the differences between DVS and scripts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. The introduction of a new dataset called the "Movie Description" dataset, which contains over 54,000 sentences aligned to video snippets from 72 HD movies. The sentences come from two sources - descriptive video service (DVS) transcripts and movie scripts. 

2. A method to semi-automatically collect and align the DVS transcripts to video by extracting and transcribing the audio, then manually aligning the sentences. 

3. The alignment and collection of movie script data by automatically aligning scripts to subtitles, then manually aligning sentences to video.

4. An analysis comparing DVS and movie scripts, which found DVS sentences tend to be more visually relevant and correct than script sentences.

5. Benchmarking different video description methods on the new dataset, including nearest neighbor retrieval and an adapted statistical machine translation approach using automatic semantic parsing to extract training labels from the sentences.

6. The adapted machine translation method was shown to achieve competitive performance on another dataset without annotations, and outperformed retrieval baselines on the new movie dataset.

In summary, the key contributions appear to be the introduction of this large new movie description dataset, the methods to collect and align it, the analysis of DVS vs scripts, and benchmarking video description approaches on it. The dataset and analysis seem valuable for future video and language research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a new dataset of movies with aligned descriptive audio and text sourced from scripts and audio descriptions for the blind, compares these sources, benchmarks approaches for generating video descriptions using this data, and shows promising results by adapting a recent translation method to extract semantic representations automatically using parsing instead of manual annotations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in video description and the use of movie scripts and descriptive video service (DVS):

- The main contribution of the paper is presenting a new large-scale dataset for video description consisting of aligned sentences from movie scripts and DVS with clips from 72 full-length movies. This is a uniquely large and diverse open-domain video description dataset. Other video description datasets are limited to specific domains like cooking or contain only short clips.

- The paper benchmarks several approaches on the new dataset, including nearest neighbor retrieval and an adapted statistical machine translation approach using semantic parsing to automatically extract labels from the sentences. This allows the translation approach to work without manual annotations.

- The authors also present a semi-automated approach for collecting and aligning the DVS data. Prior work has used movie scripts for video analysis but DVS has been largely unexplored by the computer vision community. The paper provides the first systematic comparison of DVS and scripts as sources of descriptions.

- The results show DVS tends to be more precisely aligned and visually descriptive than scripts, which often contain extra flourishes or deviations from the visuals. The aligned DVS data could enable future work on understanding stories and plots across multiple sentences.

- Overall, the size, diversity, and multi-sentence nature of the new dataset combined with the comparisons of description sources seem to represent useful contributions relative to prior video description research. The new dataset and benchmarks help move the field forward into open-domain video description and understanding temporal/narrative relationships.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different methods for semantic parsing of sentences to extract annotations, such as using more advanced natural language processing techniques. The authors note that some components like word sense disambiguation were challenging on their movie description dataset.

- Improving the visual recognition components, such as activity, object, and scene recognition, using the latest state-of-the-art techniques like deeper convolutional neural networks. Better visual recognition could improve performance on video description.

- Leveraging the multi-sentence nature of the dataset to understand plots, stories, and long-term temporal dependencies across multiple sentences. The authors suggest this as an exciting direction unique to their dataset.

- Developing models that can generate novel descriptive sentences, rather than just retrieving or translating fixed templates. The authors note most prior video description works rely on retrieval or templates rather than generative modeling.

- Extending the video description approaches to also incorporate audio, since the DVS descriptions are read aloud. Audio information could help align or describe events.

- Using alignment techniques to automatically align DVS data rather than manual alignment. The dataset could help develop and evaluate alignment methods.

- Expanding the dataset to more movies, or collecting more DVS data to increase diversity and size.

In summary, the key future directions relate to improving the visual and language understanding components, leveraging the narrative aspects of the data, and exploring generative modeling rather than retrieval for video description. The dataset itself could also be expanded and used to develop better alignment techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new dataset called the Movie Description dataset, which contains over 50,000 video-sentence pairs sourced from audio descriptions (DVS) and movie scripts aligned to 72 full length HD movies. The dataset allows for studying multi-sentence video description in an open domain setting. The authors collected the DVS by extracting and aligning the audio from Blu-ray movies. They also collected movie scripts, aligned them to the videos, and compared them to the DVS, finding the DVS to be more visually relevant and accurate. They computed visual features on the dataset including improved dense trajectories, CNN object and scene features, and released these along with the dataset. As a benchmark, they tested several approaches to generate descriptions on their dataset, including nearest neighbor retrieval and an adapted translation approach using automatically extracted semantic representations from the sentences. Their adapted translation method achieved competitive results on an existing dataset and outperformed retrieval approaches on their new movie dataset. The paper concludes that their dataset opens up new possibilities for studying open domain video description, visual grounding, activity recognition, and understanding plots across multiple sentences.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the main points from the paper:

The paper presents a new dataset for movie description that contains aligned audio descriptions (DVS) and movie scripts from 72 full-length HD movies. In total, the dataset has over 54,000 sentence descriptions paired with video snippets, providing over 56 hours of annotated video. The authors collected the DVS data by extracting and transcribing the audio descriptions from Blu-ray movies intended for the visually impaired. They also aligned relevant movie scripts to the videos. 

The paper analyzes the dataset, finding that the DVS tends to be more visually descriptive and accurate to what is shown on screen compared to movie scripts. It also benchmarks different video description approaches on the data, including nearest neighbor retrieval and an adapted statistical machine translation method that automatically extracts semantic representations from the sentences rather than relying on manual annotation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of learning from this large-scale movie dataset using current techniques. The authors plan to release the dataset to promote further research on tasks like video description, activity recognition, and plot understanding.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using audio descriptions (DVS) and movie scripts as a source of data to create a dataset for video description. To obtain the DVS data, they retrieve audio streams from Blu-ray disks, semi-automatically segment out the DVS sections, and have them transcribed. The transcripts are manually aligned to the videos. For the movie scripts, they mine online resources to obtain scripts, automatically align them to subtitles, and then manually refine the alignment. They extract visual features like dense trajectories, object detections, and scene classifications for the video snippets. For video description, they benchmark a nearest neighbor retrieval approach using the visual features and distances to sentences in the training set. They also propose using semantic parsing to extract labels from the sentences, like subjects, verbs, objects, and locations. These labels are used to train classifiers and translate predicted label tuples to sentences, adapting a prior statistical machine translation approach for video description. The paper includes analysis of the new dataset, comparison of DVS to scripts, evaluation of the semantic parsing, and results of the description methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper is presenting a new dataset for the task of video description. The key points are:

- Descriptive video service (DVS) provides audio descriptions of movies to make them accessible for blind or visually impaired people. DVS contains descriptions of the visual aspects like actions, scenes, etc. 

- DVS data could be useful for computer vision and computational linguistics tasks like video description. However, it is not available in text format. 

- Existing video description datasets are limited to short clips or a narrow domain like cooking. DVS data provides long, open-domain videos paired with descriptions.

- They collected and aligned DVS transcripts and movie scripts to create a new dataset called "Movie Description" with over 50k clips and 56 hours of video.

- They benchmark different approaches for video description on this dataset, including retrieval and an adapted translation model using semantic parsing to extract labels from the descriptions.

- Their adapted translation approach works competitively without annotations on an existing dataset and outperforms retrieval baselines on the new movie dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is a large new dataset for the task of open-domain video description, along with benchmark results of different approaches on this dataset. The dataset enables future work on understanding plots and semantics across multiple sentences.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces a new dataset called the Movie Description dataset, which contains over 54,000 video clips and sentences describing the content of those clips. The sentences come from two sources - descriptive audio (DVS) designed for visually impaired audiences, and movie scripts. The authors collect and align the DVS and script sentences to the videos.
