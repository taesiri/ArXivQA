# [FhGenie: A Custom, Confidentiality-preserving Chat AI for Corporate and   Scientific Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI chat tools like ChatGPT have great potential to enhance productivity, but using free public services poses confidentiality risks due to possible data exploitation. 
- Commercial options also lack transparency about handling user data. 
- At Fraunhofer, most data is classified beyond "public" so existing services have limited usefulness.
- There is a need for a customized, confidentiality-preserving chat AI that leverages state-of-the-art models while meeting specific requirements around compliance, security, responsible AI, etc.

Proposed Solution - FhGenie:
- Custom chat AI service built on Azure OpenAI service, providing access to models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.  
- Integrated into Fraunhofer's IT landscape - leverages existing user management and runs fully isolated on private Azure subscriptions.
- Designed for confidentiality, secure sandbox, EU data residency, and responsible AI.  
- Prompt engineering and load balancing used to meet requirements around latency, bandwidth and cost.
- Being extended with retrieval-augmented generation using Fraunhofer-specific data.
- Thousands of Fraunhofer staff use FhGenie daily.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis of confidentiality issues with public chat AIs, and motivation for customized solution.
- Design and development of FhGenie architecture to leverage state-of-the-art models while meeting security, compliance and responsible AI requirements.  
- Sharing of practical insights into prompt engineering, load balancing, deployment, and operation.
- Ongoing work like RAG integration to improve relevancy using internal data.
- Discussion of lessons learned to guide similar initiatives in other organizations.

In summary, the paper presents the end-to-end journey of conceiving, designing, building and operating FhGenie - a customized chat AI for secure enterprise usage.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using Azure services to host the FhGenie system. What were the specific Azure services used and what was the rationale for choosing each one? 

2. The paper talks about using prompt engineering to enrich the user input before sending it to the AI models. Can you expand on the specific prompt engineering techniques used? What context and instructions were added to the prompts?

3. The paper discusses tradeoffs between customizing the responsible AI capabilities in Azure vs relying on the default capabilities. What were the specific pros and cons considered in making this decision? Under what circumstances might customization be reconsidered?

4. For the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) implementation, what specific methods and data sources are planned? What are some of the key implementation challenges anticipated with RAG? 

5. The paper mentions resource limitations in Azure that necessitated load balancing. What was the specific load balancing strategy and algorithm used? How was it customized for this use case?
