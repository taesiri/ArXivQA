# [DistriFusion: Distributed Parallel Inference for High-Resolution   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating high-resolution images with diffusion models is computationally expensive, resulting in high latency. This makes interactive applications with diffusion models infeasible. While multiple GPUs are available, existing parallelization techniques like tensor parallelism have high communication costs that negate any benefits. Hence, there is a need for methods to effectively leverage multiple GPUs to accelerate single image generation from diffusion models without quality loss.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes DistriFusion, a parallelization method for diffusion models based on a new concept called "displaced patch parallelism". The key ideas are:

1. Split image into patches and process each patch on a separate GPU. This allows independent parallel operations. 

2. Reuse activations from previous diffusion step to provide context for current step. This avoids the need for synchronous communication between patches.

3. Perform sparse computations on each GPU, only operating on the assigned patch regions. This reduces computation time.

4. Hide communication latency using asynchronous communication between steps. Computation can pipeline communication.

5. Use a few initial warm-up steps with synchronous communication to boost image quality.

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes the concept of "displaced patch parallelism", which reuses activations from prior steps for patch interactions instead of synchronous communication. This is tailored to the sequential nature of diffusion models.

2. Presents DistriFusion, the first parallelization technique for single image generation on diffusion models. It can provide up to 6.1x speedup on 8 GPUs without quality loss.

3. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SDXL model, reducing latency by 1.8x, 3.4x and 6.1x for 2, 4 and 8 A100 GPUs respectively for high resolution images.

4. Enables the feasibility of interactive applications with diffusion models by significantly lowering compute requirements.

In summary, the paper makes diffusion models much more efficient by effectively using multiple GPUs in parallel. The proposed displaced patch parallelism is a new parallelization paradigm customized for these models.
