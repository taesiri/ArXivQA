# [Vision Transformer with Super Token Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11167)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we design an efficient vision transformer that can capture both global context and local features effectively, especially in the early layers?Specifically, the authors identify that standard vision transformers suffer from high redundancy when capturing local features in early layers, since the global self-attention concentrates on just a few neighboring tokens. Methods like local attention and early convolution give up global context modeling to reduce this redundancy. To address this, the paper proposes a "super token attention" mechanism that efficiently captures global context in early layers by performing self-attention on learned "super tokens" that provide a compact summary of the image content. This allows global modeling while reducing redundancy.The overall contribution is a new vision transformer backbone called Super Token Vision Transformer (SViT) that combines super token attention, convolutional feature enhancement, and a hierarchical architecture to capture both global context and local features efficiently.In summary, the central hypothesis is that super token attention can enable efficient global modeling in early transformer layers for vision, overcoming limitations of prior work. The paper proposes and evaluates the SViT architecture to validate this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new vision transformer architecture called Super Token Vision Transformer (SViT) that aims to learn efficient global representations in the early stages. 2. It introduces a Super Token Attention (STA) mechanism that efficiently captures global dependencies by performing self-attention on "super tokens" - compact aggregated representations of visual content. 3. The STA module has three main steps:   - Super token sampling to aggregate visual tokens into semantically meaningful super tokens.   - Self-attention on super tokens to model global dependencies.   - Mapping super tokens back to original token space.4. This allows the model to preserve global modeling capacity while reducing redundancy and computation compared to standard self-attention.5. Based on STA, the paper develops a hierarchical vision transformer backbone with convolutional layers called SViT.6. Experiments on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation demonstrate SViT's effectiveness and superiority over previous SOTA vision transformers.In summary, the core idea is using super tokens to reduce redundancy and enable efficient global modeling in early layers of vision transformers. The proposed SViT architecture with STA achieves strong performance across multiple vision tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the vision transformer field:- The main contribution is introducing a "super token attention" mechanism to reduce redundancy and capture global context more efficiently, especially in early layers. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like Swin Transformer and other locality-based attention mechanisms.- The overall architecture is a hierarchical vision transformer similar to many recent designs, but incorporates the new super token attention modules as well as convolutional position embeddings and feedforward layers. This combines transformer and CNN principles.- The performance on ImageNet classification surpasses recent state-of-the-art models like Swin Transformer, CrossFormer, and CoAtNet. With 95M parameters, it achieves 85.3% top-1 accuracy, outperforming models with similar model sizes.- It also shows strong performance on downstream tasks like COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation, again surpassing recent competitive models. This helps demonstrate the general applicability.- The efficiency gains from super token attention allow the model to capture global context in early layers, while many recent models have focused more on local attention. This is a differentiated design choice.- The paper provides ablation studies and visualizations to analyze the impact of different components. The comparisons to global and local attention variants help justify the super token approach.Overall, the introduction of super tokens seems to be an innovative way to allow vision transformers to leverage global context information more effectively and efficiently. The strong empirical results across tasks validate it as a competitive new design in this quickly evolving research area.
