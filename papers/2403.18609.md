# [A survey on learning models of spiking neural membrane systems and   spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides a survey and comparison of two related models - spiking neural networks (SNN) and spiking neural P systems (SNPS). Both are variants of third-generation neural networks where communication between neurons takes place using discrete spikes. 

The paper first discusses the architecture, function, and differences between SNN and SNPS. The key differences are:

- SNPS has a more formal language-theoretic motivation, while SNN is more biologically inspired. 
- SNN handles real-valued inputs/outputs encoded into spikes, while SNPS uses discrete spikes or time delays to encode information.  
- SNPS variants have been proved to be Turing complete and solve complex computational problems. The computing capability of SNN is less investigated.

The paper then summarizes recent machine learning methods for SNN, categorized into supervised learning (e.g. SpikeProp, STDP-based), unsupervised (e.g. using spike time-dependent plasticity) and deep learning methods like spiking CNN, RNN, DBN. The paper also overviews SNPS variants with learning capabilities including Hebbian learning SNPS, adaptive SNPS, deep dynamic SNPS, LSTM-SNP and more.

The paper concludes that efficient learning of multilayer SNN and SNPS still remains challenging compared to deep neural networks. Some promising future research directions are identified like SNN/SNPS hardware implementation, sentiment classification using their bio-inspired structure, time series analysis leveraging their dynamical representation of patterns over time. An open problem is more efficient implementation of spike timing-dependent plasticity based learning in SNPS models.
