## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the LaTeX source code, it does not appear that this document makes a specific research contribution. Rather, it seems to be an edited volume or handbook that collects and presents papers from various authors on the topic of argumentation and AI. 

Some key indications this is an edited volume rather than a research paper:

- It has an editorial board listed as authors.
- The preface discusses the goals of the handbook to serve as an anthology and hub to track argumentation research.
- There is a table of contents that references chapters for different author names. 
- The acknowledgements thank contributing authors.

So in summary, this document itself does not make a singular research contribution, but rather serves as a handbook collecting papers on argumentation research. Its main purpose is to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing in the field.
