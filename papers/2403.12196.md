# [Shifting the Lens: Detecting Malware in npm Ecosystem with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Software supply chain attacks are increasing, with 45% of organizations predicted to encounter such attacks by 2025. There is an urgent need to improve detection of malware injected into open source packages. Current techniques like rules, differential analysis and ML have high false positive rates and limited automation. More advanced, automated approaches are needed for accurate and low false-positive malware detection.

Proposed Solution: The paper presents SocketAI Scanner - a 3-stage workflow using ChatGPT models (GPT-3 and GPT-4) and iterative self-refinement to detect malware. 

1) Initial Reports: Models generate multiple preliminary analysis reports for a file. 

2) Critical Analysis: Models reassess the initial reports more rigorously to refine the analysis.

3) Final Report: Models provide a conclusive summary report with scoring for malware, risk etc.

The workflow uses specialized prompts and techniques like zero-shot role-play Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve reasoning. 

Contributions:

- SocketAI Scanner: A new malware detection workflow using ChatGPT models
- Malware detection focused prompts to trigger model's reasoning 
- Evaluation on 18,754 npm packages shows high precision (91-99%) and F1 (94-97%)
- Detects 2,067 malware instances like data theft, backdoors etc.
- Comparison with static analysis shows 15-25% F1 score improvements
- Analyzes strengths and limitations of using ChatGPT for malware detection

The workflow shows promising results in automating malware detection with minimal false positives. The analysis also provides insights into effectively using ChatGPT models for security tasks.
