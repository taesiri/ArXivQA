# [RankPrompt: Step-by-Step Comparisons Make Language Models Better   Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12373)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT often make logical errors when reasoning through multiple steps to arrive at an answer. 
- Existing solutions either require extensive human annotations to train verifiers or use majority voting which fails when responses are inconsistent.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "RankPrompt", a novel prompting method to enable LLMs to self-rank their reasoning paths without additional resources. 
- Core ideas:
   - Decompose ranking into step-by-step comparisons among responses using instructions.
   - Use few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs to generate comparison exemplars that guide ranking.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes the use of step-aware comparison instructions and automatically created comparison exemplars to systematically compare reasoning paths. 
- Evaluations across 11 arithmetic and commonsense reasoning datasets show RankPrompt boosts performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 by up to 13%.
- RankPrompt aligns 74% with human preferences on AlpacaEval for open-ended text generation evaluation.
- Analysis shows importance of comparison exemplar correctness and complexity in ranking performance.
- Demonstrates robustness of RankPrompt against inconsistent responses and order variations.

In summary, the paper presents RankPrompt as an effective prompting based method to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging their ability to compare responses in a step-by-step manner. The automatic creation of high quality comparison exemplars is a key difference from prior work.
