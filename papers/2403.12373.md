# [RankPrompt: Step-by-Step Comparisons Make Language Models Better   Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12373)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT often make logical errors when reasoning through multiple steps to arrive at an answer. 
- Existing solutions either require extensive human annotations to train verifiers or use majority voting which fails when responses are inconsistent.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "RankPrompt", a novel prompting method to enable LLMs to self-rank their reasoning paths without additional resources. 
- Core ideas:
   - Decompose ranking into step-by-step comparisons among responses using instructions.
   - Use few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs to generate comparison exemplars that guide ranking.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes the use of step-aware comparison instructions and automatically created comparison exemplars to systematically compare reasoning paths. 
- Evaluations across 11 arithmetic and commonsense reasoning datasets show RankPrompt boosts performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 by up to 13%.
- RankPrompt aligns 74% with human preferences on AlpacaEval for open-ended text generation evaluation.
- Analysis shows importance of comparison exemplar correctness and complexity in ranking performance.
- Demonstrates robustness of RankPrompt against inconsistent responses and order variations.

In summary, the paper presents RankPrompt as an effective prompting based method to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging their ability to compare responses in a step-by-step manner. The automatic creation of high quality comparison exemplars is a key difference from prior work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces RankPrompt, a novel prompting method that enables large language models to systematically compare and rank reasoning paths by using step-aware comparison instructions and automatically generated exemplars, significantly improving reasoning performance across various tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of RankPrompt, a novel prompting method for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) RankPrompt introduces a comparative evaluation approach that instructs LLMs to systematically compare multiple candidate reasoning paths step-by-step before selecting the optimal response. This diverges from prior methods that score candidates independently. 

2) RankPrompt incorporates automatically generated comparison exemplars that guide LLMs to effectively execute the ranking process in a few-shot setting, reducing the need for manually designed prompts or labeled data.

3) Experiments across 11 reasoning tasks and an open-ended generation benchmark demonstrate that RankPrompt boosts the performance of LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4, outperforming competitive baselines. The gains are especially significant on complex arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.

4) Analysis shows that RankPrompt is robust to inconsistent candidate answers and ordering variations. The correctness and complexity of comparison exemplars are identified as key factors influencing the efficacy of the approach.

In summary, the core innovation lies in the introduction of a systematic comparative ranking framework reinforced by automatically constructed exemplars to enhance LLM-based reasoning.

The method is evaluated on various reasoning tasks as well as on an automatic evaluation benchmark.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does RankPrompt's step-by-step comparison of reasoning paths help improve the reasoning abilities of language models compared to evaluating candidates independently? What are the limitations of independent evaluation?

2. The paper mentions that RankPrompt is effective for tasks with inconsistent candidate answers. What specific experiments were conducted to demonstrate this? How do the results compare to majority voting?

3. What is the motivation behind using temperature sampling during candidate generation? How does this encourage diversity among reasoning paths? What temperature values were tested?

4. Explain the algorithm for automatically generating comparison exemplars. What is the criteria used for selecting high-quality comparison chains? How many labeled examples are needed?

5. What prompts were used for the baseline CoT prompting method? Were these prompts optimized for each specific task? If not, would further prompt engineering improve the baselines? 

6. For the error analysis on AQUA-RAT, what percentage of each error type (calculation, logical, etc.) was reduced by RankPrompt? Are certain error types more difficult to mitigate?

7. How many comparison exemplars were tested in the experiments? What was the motivation for using only a single exemplar? Would using more exemplars continue improving performance? 

8. What experiments were done to test the robustness of RankPrompt against variations in candidate orderings? How did the consistency rate compare to the Zero Ranking method?

9. The paper mentions the high cost of the OpenAI API. What was the total compute budget used for the experiments? Could the method be replicated with lower-cost models?

10. The conclusion mentions enhancing the ranking capabilities of open-source models like LLaMA. What modifications would be needed to apply RankPrompt to these models? Would the performance be comparable?
