# [eRST: A Signaled Graph Theory of Discourse Relations and Organization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13560)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) is a popular framework for discourse analysis, but has limitations like inability to handle tree-breaking relations and lack of rationale behind relations from explicit signals. Other frameworks like PDTB address some weaknesses but have their own drawbacks.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Enhanced RST (eRST), a new theoretical framework that retains benefits of RST like nuclearity and full document structure while also allowing tree-breaking relations and multiple concurrent relations.

- eRST annotations consist of: (1) a primary RST tree over elementary discourse units, (2) a set of secondary directed edges expressing additional relations, licensed by discourse markers without a home in the primary tree or unambiguous syntax like reported speech, (3) signals like discourse markers that provide rationales for relations.

Main Contributions:

- Formalism definition for eRST covering primary trees, secondary edges and signals with precise constraints and conditions. Allows more complete representation of relations in text.

- Extension of annotation scheme and tools to support eRST parsing. Release of new eRST-annotated English corpus covering 12 genres with over 200k tokens.

- Definition and implementation of new discourse parsing task and evaluation metrics for eRST graphs. Provides baseline neural system and results.

- Demonstration of potential applications uniquely enabled by eRST's expressivity like extraction of signal-based relation subtypes, comprehensive attribution analyses, evaluating content polarity and more.

Overall the paper addresses a key limitation of prior theories to enable more detailed computational discourse analysis while retaining their advantages within a well-defined enhanced framework.
