# [Limit of the Maximum Random Permutation Set Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Random permutation set (RPS) is a generalization of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory that considers ordered information. RPS entropy measures the uncertainty of RPS. 
- The maximum RPS entropy principle states that the entropy-maximizing RPS represents the current state of a system. 
- However, the complex analytical expression for maximum RPS entropy makes it difficult to study its properties and physical meaning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper defines the "envelope" of an entropy function as the function inside the logarithm for the maximum entropy. For RPS entropy, this envelope can represent the possible state space. 
- The paper proves a concise limit form for the RPS entropy envelope as $N\to\infty$: $e Ã— (N!)^2$, where $N$ is number of elements.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an intuitive definition of entropy envelope to represent maximum entropy state space.
- Derives and proves a simple limit form for the complex RPS entropy envelope. 
- This connects maximum RPS entropy to fundamental mathematical constants $e$ and $N!$, offering potential physical insights.
- Greatly reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$.
- Numerical analysis validates accuracy and efficiency of the limit approximation.

In summary, the paper makes RPS entropy analysis more tractable by proving a compact limit form for its envelope. This lays groundwork to better understand the meaning and applications of maximum RPS entropy.
