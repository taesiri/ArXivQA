# [Towards Optimal Customized Architecture for Heterogeneous Federated   Learning with Contrastive Cloud-Edge Model Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Heterogeneous data distribution (non-IID data) across clients in federated learning leads to poor convergence and high communication costs. This is particularly challenging for large neural network models.
- Existing model decoupling solutions designate the last layer as the "head" (personalized layer) and earlier layers as "body" based on Central Kernel Alignment theory. However, this rigid "last layer as head" design is not optimal.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called FedCMD with two key innovations:
   1) Contrastive personalized layer selection: Identifies the optimal personalized layer for each client by quantifying heterogeneity using a new metric called "feature distribution transfer distance" based on Wasserstein distance. This considers both layer inputs and outputs.
   2) Weighted global aggregation: Aggregates non-personalized layers globally using similarity weighting of personalized layers to enhance personalization performance.

- FedCMD has two phases:
   1) Personalized layer selection phase: Standard federated learning to collaboratively elect the personalized layer based on the proposed selection mechanism.
   2) Heterogeneous federated learning phase: Fixed personalized layer updated locally. Other layers aggregated globally with weighted averaging based on personalized layer similarity.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of "feature distribution transfer" metric based on Wasserstein distance to identify the best personalized layer instead of rigid "last layer as head" selection
- Novel FedCMD framework with contrastive personalized layer selection technique and weighted global aggregation method
- Superior performance over 9 state-of-the-art solutions on 10 datasets, especially for complex datasets like CIFAR100
- First work to select non-last layers as personalized layer, challenging standard Central Kernel Alignment based selection

The key insight is quantifying heterogeneity across layers using the proposed feature distribution transfer metric to facilitate dynamic and optimal personalized layer selection instead of fixed conventions. This allows FedCMD to address data heterogeneity more effectively.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called FedCMD that selects the optimal personalized layer in a neural network model to handle data heterogeneity across clients by quantifying feature distribution shifts using Wasserstein distance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new distribution distance metric called feature distribution transfer for personalized layer selection in federated learning. This is based on three key findings from extensive experiments on real-world datasets. 

2. It develops a novel heterogeneous federated learning framework called FedCMD with two main phases - personalized layer selection and heterogeneous federated learning. It introduces a contrastive layer selection mechanism to quantify heterogeneity in data distributions and select the personalized layer.

3. It provides two practical algorithms - one for achieving the contrastive personalized layer selection and another for weighted global aggregation across the Cloud-Edge federated learning system.

4. It conducts comprehensive experiments validating the performance superiority of the proposed FedCMD framework compared to 9 other state-of-the-art solutions over 10 datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the solutions.

In summary, the main highlight is the introduction of the new contrastive personalized layer selection approach and the overall FedCMD framework for heterogeneous federated learning that outperforms existing solutions.
