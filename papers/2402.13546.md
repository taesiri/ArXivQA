# [LLMs Meet Long Video: Advancing Long Video Comprehension with An   Interactive Visual Adapter in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Long video understanding poses significant challenges for AI systems, including high computational costs from extensive tokens, reduced clarity from token aggregation, and difficulty answering questions due to irrelevant visual tokens. 
- Existing language models (LLMs) struggle with long-form video comprehension due to limited video token capacity and inability to distill question-relevant visual details.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an Interactive Visual Adapter (IVA) to enable in-depth interaction between LLMs and long video content.  
- Efficient video tokens are produced by combining global & aggregated fine-grained frame features and temporal embeddings from a causal transformer.
- The IVA contains a lightweight temporal frame selector to obtain question-relevant frames and spatial feature interactor to capture fine-grained details based on query embeddings.
- This allows the LLM to comprehend overall video content through efficient tokens while leveraging IVA to focus on precise visual signals.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of challenges for modeling long videos with LLMs, proposing IVA to bridge gap through efficient tokens and visual interaction.
- IVA dynamically selects relevant frames and interacts with fine-grained spatial features using a shareable, lightweight adapter architecture. 
- Experiments show IVA significantly improves LLM video QA performance on long & short benchmarks. Ablations confirm IVA's effectiveness.

In summary, the paper identifies difficulties faced by LLMs in long video understanding and introduces an Interactive Visual Adapter solution to select relevant signals and enable fine-grained interaction with visual content, enhancing video comprehension abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an Interactive Visual Adapter (IVA) within large language models to enhance long video comprehension through efficient video tokens and precise question-relevant visual interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an Interactive Visual Adapter (IVA) to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) to process and interpret long video content. Specifically:

- The paper analyzes the challenges of using LLMs for long video understanding, including high computational costs from extensive video tokens, reduced visual clarity from token aggregation, and difficulty capturing question-relevant visual details. 

- To address these issues, the authors introduce the IVA module that can be integrated into LLMs. The IVA contains a lightweight temporal frame selector to identify relevant frames based on contextual queries, and a spatial feature interactor to engage with fine-grained visual features of selected frames.

- This allows the LLM to achieve comprehensive understanding of long videos through efficient video tokens, while also enabling precise interactions with visual elements through the IVA.

- Experimental results on long and short video QA benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the IVA significantly improves the video understanding performance of LLMs. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the IVA.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the Interactive Visual Adapter to enhance long video processing capabilities of large language models, which is demonstrated through quantitative experiments and analyses.
