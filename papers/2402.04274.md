# [FPGA Deployment of LFADS for Real-time Neuroscience Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04274)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Analyzing large-scale neural recordings is crucial for studying population dynamics in neuroscience experiments. Latent factor models like LFADS are powerful methods but have high computational demands. 
- As recording scales increase exponentially, low-latency real-time processing is becoming essential but challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement LFADS on an FPGA using HLS to accelerate inference and enable real-time closed-loop experiments.

Methods:
- Use a simplified LFADS variant with autoencoder structure instead of variational autoencoder.
- Develop HLS model using hls4ml that translates Keras model to optimized hardware logic.
- Employ quantization-aware training to reduce precision without significant performance drop.

Contributions:  
- Automated workflow to deploy LFADS on FPGA using hls4ml.
- Quantization schemes to optimize model for efficient FPGA inference.
- Demonstrated 41.97 Î¼s latency for LFADS trial inference on Xilinx Alveo U55C FPGA.
- Low latency will enable processing large-scale recordings in real-time for closed-loop experiments.

In summary, they have developed an FPGA implementation of LFADS using HLS that achieves low latency to enable real-time processing of neural data at scale for next-gen closed-loop neuroscience experiments. The quantization and HLS automation provides an efficient deployment solution.
