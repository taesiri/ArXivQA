# [Scaling Diffusion Models to Real-World 3D LiDAR Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of 3D scene completion from sparse LiDAR data. LiDAR sensors are commonly used to collect 3D point clouds of a scene in autonomous driving scenarios. However, the collected point clouds are sparse with large gaps between points. Completing these LiDAR scans to fill in missing surfaces would provide a more complete scene representation that could benefit various perception tasks. Prior methods have limitations: voxel-based approaches lose fine details due to discretization, image-based diffusion models fail to fully complete occluded areas when reprojected to 3D, and existing 3D diffusion models do not scale well to large real-world scenes.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose a novel point-level diffusion model that operates directly on 3D points to complete LiDAR scans. They reformulate the standard denoising process to add noise locally to each point instead of globally to the entire point cloud. This retains details when scaling to scene sizes. They also propose a regularization technique to constrain the predicted noise distribution during denoising. Their model takes a single LiDAR scan as input, adds noise to expand it, and iteratively predicts and removes noise to denoise it into a completed point cloud reconstruction. An additional refinement network further enhances details.

Main Contributions:
- A scene-scale diffusion formulation that enables direct point-level completion of large real LiDAR scans
- A local point denoising approach that adds noise per-point to retain detail  
- A noise regularization method to stabilize training
- Experiments showing their technique generates more detailed completions than previous state-of-the-art methods
- The ability to complete scenes from new datasets without fine-tuning due to conditioning on the input scan

In summary, the paper presents a novel point cloud diffusion approach to complete LiDAR scans with increased detail compared to prior arts, demonstrating potential to benefit autonomous driving perception.
