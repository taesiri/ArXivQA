# [Information Capacity Regret Bounds for Bandits with Mediator Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies a bandit model called "mediator feedback", where there is a set of policies/distributions over a common outcome space. 
- On each round, the learner picks a policy and observes a sample from that policy's distribution along with the loss incurred by that outcome.
- The goal is to minimize regret compared to the best fixed policy in hindsight.
- Key question: How can the similarity between policies be exploited to improve regret guarantees?

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a new measure called "policy set capacity" to capture effective complexity of the policy set based on chi-squared divergence.
- Shows that Exp4 algorithm, with learning rate tuned using capacity, enjoys regret bound scaling with âˆš(capacity * T) in adversarial setting.  
- Also provides regret bounds for stochastic and "best of both worlds" settings featuring capacity.

Main Contributions:
- Policy set capacity provides tighter characterization of problem complexity compared to prior measures.
- First regret bounds for mediator feedback that can shrink arbitrarily when policies become more similar.
- Establishes fundamental limit on what can be achieved under this feedback model. 
- Provides regret bounds for Exp4 that hold simultaneously in adversarial and stochastic settings.
- Comparisons with linear bandits highlight importance of observing outcomes when exploiting policy similarities.

In summary, the paper formalizes the value of outcome observations in bandits with policy sets, in terms enabling algorithms to automatically adapt based on the affinity between policies. The policy set capacity is proposed as a key metric that captures this affinity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper studies a multi-armed bandit problem with mediator feedback where upon choosing a policy (arm), the learner observes a sampled outcome and its loss; it introduces a measure called the policy set capacity to capture the complexity of the policy set, provides regret bounds for EXP4 in terms of this capacity, and shows that exploiting similarity between policies is possible under this feedback model but not under linear bandits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new complexity measure called the "policy set capacity" to quantify the effective size or complexity of a policy set in the mediator feedback setting. This capacity measure is based on the mutual chi-squared information and has favorable properties compared to previous measures.

2. It provides improved regret bounds for the EXP4 algorithm that scale with the policy set capacity, showing EXP4 can exploit the similarity between policies. These bounds are proven to be near optimal through matching lower bounds.

3. It extends the results to the case of time-varying policy distributions, providing history-dependent bounds for bandits with expert advice. 

4. It gives best-of-both-worlds regret bounds for EXP4 that scale with the capacity. In the stochastic setting, the bounds are only logarithmic in the time horizon.

5. It shows, through lower bounds, that the ability to exploit policy similarity is unique to the mediator feedback setting and not possible more generally in linear bandits.

6. It analyzes a full information variant and gives a bound in terms of the KL-divergence based capacity.

In summary, the paper provides comprehensive regret analyses for EXP4 in mediator feedback problems using the newly introduced capacity measure, which is shown to meaningfully quantify problem complexity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Mediator feedback model: A bandit framework where policies map to distributions over outcomes. Upon choosing a policy, the learner observes a sampled outcome and its loss.

- Policy set capacity: An information-theoretic complexity measure for the policy set based on the mutual chi-squared information between policies and outcomes. 

- Regret bounds: Performance guarantees for the EXP4 algorithm in terms of the policy set capacity. Near matching lower bounds are also provided.

- Best-of-both-worlds: Regret bounds for EXP4 that scale logarithmically with time in stochastic environments, while retaining sublinear scaling in the worst case. 

- Linear bandits: A model where the learner directly observes the expected loss of the chosen policy. Shown to not allow improved regret in terms of policy set affinity.

- Full information: A variant where the entire loss vector is observed. Regret bounds in terms of the KL-divergence based capacity.

The key terms cover the different models and regimes studied, the proposed complexity measure, the algorithm analyzed, and the types of performance guarantees derived. The lower bounds and linear bandits comparison also demonstrate fundamental limits.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new notion of capacity for the policy set based on the chi-squared divergence. How does this differ conceptually and technically from prior capacity measures like the ones based on total variation or KL divergence? What are the key advantages?

2. The regret bounds for EXP4 are shown to scale with the proposed capacity measure. What is the intuition behind why this dependence emerges? How does the proof technique exploit properties of the chi-squared divergence?

3. The capacity enjoys upper bounds in terms of both the total variation metric and chi-squared diameter. When can these bounds be loose and in what cases can the capacity be much smaller? Provide some illustrative examples. 

4. For two policies, the capacity is related to statistical divergences like the triangular discrimination and squared Hellinger distance. What is the conceptual meaning behind these connections? Do they suggest any statistical interpretation for the capacity?

5. The regret bound is shown to be near optimal in a minimax sense for some policy set families via intricate adversarial constructions. What are the key ideas behind these constructions? How do they relate the capacity to fundamental statistical distinguishability between environments?

6. The techniques used for the lower bounds seem heavily tailored to the specific policy set structures. What are the major obstacles in proving more general minimax optimality results? Are there other generic lower bounding techniques one could try to apply?

7. The full information bound relates the capacity to an information radius of the policy set. What operational significance does this information radius have in coding theory and how does this connection lend further meaning to the capacity definition?

8. The linear bandits lower bound shows exploiting similarity of policies requires observing individual outcome losses. Is this distinction fundamental or could ideas from linear bandits still be used to obtain improved regret guarantees under mediator feedback?

9. The algorithm seems simple but analysis quite technical. What are the major steps in the analysis that drive the improved dependence on the policy set structure? What Makes the analysis particularly challenging?

10. The BOBW analysis relies on an iw stability argument for Exp4. Why does this argument not directly exploit properties of the capacity? How could the analysis be strengthened to make the dependence on capacity more transparent in the stochastic case?
