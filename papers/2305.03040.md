# [TUVF: Learning Generalizable Texture UV Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03040)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to generate high-fidelity texture for 3D objects in a controllable and disentangled manner. Specifically, the key research questions are:- How can we generate realistic texture on a 3D shape surface from a collection of single-view images without 3D supervision? - How can we disentangle the texture representation from the underlying 3D shape geometry so that textures can be flexibly controlled and transferred across different shapes?The main hypothesis is that by generating textures in a canonical UV space instead of directly on the 3D surface, the texture representation can be decoupled from the shape geometry. This allows controlling the texture synthesis process and transferring textures across different shapes.To validate this hypothesis, the authors propose the Texture UV Radiance Fields (TUVF) approach. TUVF represents textures in a learnable canonical UV space and integrates it with a radiance field representation for efficient rendering. The disentangled texture in TUVF enables applications like flexibly controlling textures based on shape inputs and editing textures by directly operating on rendered views. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TUVF achieves realistic texture synthesis and significantly outperforms previous methods in texture control and transfer.In summary, the core research question is how to achieve disentangled texture generation for 3D objects through a canonical space. The key hypothesis is that generating texture in a UV space can decouple it from shape. TUVF is proposed to validate this idea and shows strong results for controllable texture synthesis.
