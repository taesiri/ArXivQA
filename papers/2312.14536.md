# [Adaptive Reconvergence-driven AIG Rewriting via Strategy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional reconvergence-driven AIG rewriting focuses only on optimizing the reconvergence cone using Boolean algebra minimization. However, there are opportunities to incorporate other node-rewriting algorithms that may be better suited for certain cones. 

- It is challenging to determine the most suitable node-rewriting algorithm for a given subgraph.

- Previously modified substructures can be overwritten by subsequent cones during each rewriting iteration.

Proposed Solution - Adaptive Reconvergence-driven AIG Rewriting:

- Incorporates multi-strategy-based AIG rewriting to expand optimization space. Supports multiple node-rewriting algorithms instead of just Boolean algebra minimization.

- Uses a strategy learning-based algorithm selection method to determine the best node-rewriting algorithm for a given cone, formulating it as a classification problem.

- Solves classification problem using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to generate training data, followed by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classification.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes an adaptive approach to reconvergence-driven rewriting that adapts the node-rewriting algorithm based on cone characteristics.

- Expands optimization search space by supporting multiple rewrite algorithms instead of just Boolean minimization.

- Introduces a novel strategy learning method involving RL-based training data generation and MLP classification for algorithm selection.

- Demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods, with average gains of 5.567% in size and 5.327% in depth.

- Provides an effective framework for adaptive selection of node-rewriting algorithms to optimize reconvergence-driven rewriting.
