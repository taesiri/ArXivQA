# [Adaptive Reconvergence-driven AIG Rewriting via Strategy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional reconvergence-driven AIG rewriting focuses only on optimizing the reconvergence cone using Boolean algebra minimization. However, there are opportunities to incorporate other node-rewriting algorithms that may be better suited for certain cones. 

- It is challenging to determine the most suitable node-rewriting algorithm for a given subgraph.

- Previously modified substructures can be overwritten by subsequent cones during each rewriting iteration.

Proposed Solution - Adaptive Reconvergence-driven AIG Rewriting:

- Incorporates multi-strategy-based AIG rewriting to expand optimization space. Supports multiple node-rewriting algorithms instead of just Boolean algebra minimization.

- Uses a strategy learning-based algorithm selection method to determine the best node-rewriting algorithm for a given cone, formulating it as a classification problem.

- Solves classification problem using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to generate training data, followed by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classification.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes an adaptive approach to reconvergence-driven rewriting that adapts the node-rewriting algorithm based on cone characteristics.

- Expands optimization search space by supporting multiple rewrite algorithms instead of just Boolean minimization.

- Introduces a novel strategy learning method involving RL-based training data generation and MLP classification for algorithm selection.

- Demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods, with average gains of 5.567% in size and 5.327% in depth.

- Provides an effective framework for adaptive selection of node-rewriting algorithms to optimize reconvergence-driven rewriting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adaptive reconvergence-driven AIG rewriting approach that expands the optimization search space through multi-strategy node rewriting and determines the best node rewriting algorithm via a strategy learning method based on reinforcement learning and classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an adaptive reconvergence-driven AIG rewriting algorithm that combines two key techniques:

1) Multi-strategy-based AIG rewriting: This expands the traditional reconvergence-driven rewriting by supporting multiple node-rewriting algorithms instead of just one. This expands the optimization search space.

2) Strategy learning-based algorithm selection: This determines the most suitable node-rewriting algorithm to apply for a given reconvergence cone, formulated as a classification problem. A reinforcement learning method is used to generate training data.

The paper shows through experiments that this adaptive approach yields significant improvements over traditional reconvergence-driven rewriting, achieving average reductions of 5.567% in size and 5.327% in depth.

The key ideas are expanding the optimization space via multiple rewrite algorithms, and using learning to select the best algorithm for each cone based on its features. The combination of these two techniques makes the rewrite process more adaptive and achieves better optimization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that there are opportunities to incorporate other node-rewriting algorithms that are better suited for specific cones. What are some examples of node-rewriting algorithms that could be incorporated and what types of cones would they be well-suited for?

2. In the problem formulation, you define the state space as the features extracted from the computed reconvergence cone. What other features could potentially be useful to include in defining the state? How might including additional features impact the complexity of the state space?

3. You formulate the optimal node-rewriting algorithm selection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use Q-learning to learn a good policy. What are some challenges and limitations of using an MDP formulation for this problem? 

4. The strategy sequence method is introduced to help compute the current and next state during Q-learning. What are some alternative approaches you considered for tracking state transitions and why did you choose the strategy sequence method?

5. In generating the training data using Q-learning, how did you determine hyperparameters like the number of episodes, epsilon decay rate, and the reward function? What impact do these parameters have?

6. For the MLP classifier, what other classification algorithms did you consider? What made you decide on using an MLP architecture over other options? 

7. The classifier takes the features of the cone as input. Did you consider using any other inputs to the classifier, such as properties of the full AIG? If so, why were they not included?

8. How do you determine when the Q-learning procedure and the classifier model have converged? What metrics are used to evaluate convergence?

9. The results show clear improvements over the traditional method. What areas of the proposed method have the most room for improvement in future work?

10. How difficult would it be to adapt this method to other circuit representations besides AIGs? What modifications would need to be made?
