# [MyPortrait: Morphable Prior-Guided Personalized Portrait Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02703)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MyPortrait, a novel framework for generating high-quality personalized talking faces from a monocular video. The key insight is to leverage two complementary priors - a personalized prior from the input video containing fine details of the person, and a morphable prior from a 3D face model providing diverse facial shapes and motions. Specifically, a two-stage training strategy is designed. First, the network reconstructs the input video, learning to generate personalized details. Second, auxiliary data with diverse 3D face parameters is introduced to teach the model to generalize to novel views and expressions outside the original video. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in both video-driven and audio-driven facial reenactment. The simple yet effective coordinate-based network structure also enables real-time performance. In summary, by combining personalized and morphable priors in a principled manner, MyPortrait pushes the boundary of controllable, identity-preserving neural rendering for portrait videos.
