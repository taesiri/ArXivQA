# [MyPortrait: Morphable Prior-Guided Personalized Portrait Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02703)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MyPortrait, a novel framework for generating high-quality personalized talking faces from a monocular video. The key insight is to leverage two complementary priors - a personalized prior from the input video containing fine details of the person, and a morphable prior from a 3D face model providing diverse facial shapes and motions. Specifically, a two-stage training strategy is designed. First, the network reconstructs the input video, learning to generate personalized details. Second, auxiliary data with diverse 3D face parameters is introduced to teach the model to generalize to novel views and expressions outside the original video. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in both video-driven and audio-driven facial reenactment. The simple yet effective coordinate-based network structure also enables real-time performance. In summary, by combining personalized and morphable priors in a principled manner, MyPortrait pushes the boundary of controllable, identity-preserving neural rendering for portrait videos.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 MyPortrait proposes a novel prior-guided framework for neural portrait generation that combines personalized prior from a monocular video and morphable prior from 3D face morphable space to generate high-quality personalized dynamic faces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a simple, general, and flexible framework for neural portrait generation, which supports both video-driven and audio-driven facial animation given a monocular video of a person.

2. Proposing a novel prior-guided training strategy for personalized portrait generation with realistic details, which combines personalized prior from a monocular video and morphable prior from face morphable space. 

3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the quality of generation over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new framework and training strategy for neural portrait generation using personalized and morphable priors, which generates higher quality and more realistic personalized talking faces compared to previous methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Neural portrait generation - The overall goal of the paper is generating realistic personalized talking faces or portraits using neural networks.

- Personalized prior - The detailed facial texture information contained in a monocular video of a person, which provides fine details for generating realistic portraits. 

- Morphable prior - A universal facial shape prior provided by 3D morphable models that captures variations in facial shapes and semantics like poses and expressions.

- Two-stage training strategy - The proposed training approach that first learns the personalized prior from a monocular video, and then incorporates the morphable prior to handle novel face parameters.

- Online and offline versions - The online version generates portraits in real-time while the offline version sends test data into training to further improve generation quality over state-of-the-art methods.

- Video-driven and audio-driven tasks - The framework supports both applications of video-driven facial reenactment and audio-driven speech to facial animation.

- Self-reenactment and cross-reenactment - Experiments conducted to assess both reconstructing the portrait video itself, and reenacting another person's expressions/speech on the portrait.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two priors - personalized prior and morphable prior. What is the key difference between these two priors and how do they complement each other?

2. The paper mentions two training stages - reconstruction training and scalable training. Explain the objectives of these two stages and how they help in achieving the overall goal of generating high-quality personalized talking faces. 

3. The paper presents online and offline versions of the proposed method. What is the key trade-off between these two versions in terms of real-time performance versus generation quality?

4. Explain how the introduction of morphable prior helps mitigate the problem of quality degradation for unseen/novel face parameters that are outside the limited parameter space of the monocular input video.

5. The velocity loss term in the objective function aims to ensure coherence between adjacent frames in the generated video. Elaborate on why this is an important consideration.

6. The paper demonstrates both video-driven and audio-driven experiments. Discuss if the overall framework and methodology remains exactly same or needs any modifications when switching between these two modalities.

7. Analyze the limitations of 2D-based talking face generation methods mentioned in the paper and explain how the proposed approach attempts to overcome some of those limitations.  

8. The t-SNE visualizations provide some insight into how the scalable training strategy changes the distribution of face parameters. Interpret those visualizations and discuss their implications.

9. What other quantitative evaluation metrics could have been used to analyze the performance of the method apart from the ones already presented?

10. The paper mentions scope for future work by combining the proposed approach with face segmentation methods. Elaborate why this could be an interesting direction.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating realistic talking faces is challenging, especially to generate high-quality dynamic faces with personalized details under novel controllable parameters. Existing methods either lack personalized details due to reliance on a generic face model, or have difficulty generalizing to novel face poses/expressions outside the training data. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes "MyPortrait", a framework to generate personalized talking face videos from a monocular input video. The key idea is to utilize two complementary priors:

1) Personalized prior: The input video contains person-specific facial details under different poses, expressions and speech, which provide a strong personalized prior for that identity. 

2) Morphable prior: A 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) provides a facial shape space that covers diverse poses and expressions, supplementing the limited variation in the input video.

The method has an offline high-quality mode and a real-time online mode. The offline mode incorporates test data into training to enhance quality but loses real-time capability.

Contributions:

- Proposes a novel combination of personalized prior and morphable prior for talking face generation, exploiting strengths of both for quality and generalization.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance, with both an offline high-quality mode and a real-time capable online mode.

- Simple and flexible framework that supports both video-driven and audio-driven facial reenactment from just a monocular video input.

- Comprehensive experiments validate superiority over existing methods in self-reenactment, cross-reenactment and audio-driven scenarios.

In summary, the paper presents a novel prior-guided framework for generating high quality, personalized talking faces in a simple and flexible manner, with state-of-the-art results. The combination of a person-specific prior and 3DMM facial prior is the key enabler.
