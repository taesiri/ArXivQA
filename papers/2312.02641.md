## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Unfortunately, there is no actual content in the code you provided. It appears to just be plotting some mathematical functions. Without any contextual information or description of what these functions represent, I do not have enough information to summarize the content or purpose of the paper. If this code is meant to be illustrative of some concept covered in a paper, please provide a description of what is being illustrated or what the functions signify. With more context, I would be happy to attempt to summarize the key points. But based solely on the code, there is no meaningful way for me to summarize non-existent content. Please let me know if you can provide some additional background details to give this code meaning and purpose.
