# [Inertial Line-Of-Sight Stabilization Using a 3-DOF Spherical Parallel   Manipulator with Coaxial Input Shafts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02641)

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on the content shown, which appears to be a LaTeX source code plotting some singularity loci and a prescribed workspace, some keywords or key terms associated with this paper could be:

- Singularity loci 
- Workspace 
- Robot kinematics
- Inverse kinematics
- Plotting/visualization
- LaTeX/TikZ

The plots seem to show some kind of singular configurations to avoid in the context of a robotic manipulator, as well as a defined valid workspace. So terms related to robot kinematics, singularities, workspaces, and visualization/plotting using LaTeX would be relevant.
