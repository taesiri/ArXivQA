# [GINN-LP: A Growing Interpretable Neural Network for Discovering   Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Traditional machine learning models act as black-boxes and do not produce interpretable functions that connect inputs to outputs. However, discovering such interpretable equations governing the data is desirable in many applications. This paper focuses on discovering multivariate Laurent polynomial (LP) equations, which are important in representing many real-world physical phenomena. Performing an exhaustive search over the combinatorial space of possible LPs is intractable. Hence, efficient methods are needed to discover LPs from data.

Method: 
The paper proposes GINN-LP, an interpretable neural network that can discover the form and coefficients of multivariate LPs governing a dataset. The key ideas are:

1) A new interpretable NN block called the "power-term approximator" (PTA) is introduced. Using logarithmic/exponential activations, a PTA block can represent a single term of a multivariate LP. 

2) Multiple PTA blocks are combined in parallel to allow discovery of LPs with multiple terms. This architecture is end-to-end differentiable, enabling training via backpropagation.

3) A neural network growth strategy is used to automatically determine the suitable number of terms, avoiding overfitting. Regularization also encourages discovery of simpler LPs.  

4) An ensemble method combines GINN-LP with other symbolic regression techniques to handle both LP and non-LP based datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Contributions:

1) The PTA block - a new interpretable NN block to represent single LP terms

2) GINN-LP: An end-to-end differentiable NN using PTA blocks to discover multivariate LPs

3) Neural network growth strategy and training methodology enabling automated and efficient discovery of LPs

4) State-of-the-art performance in discovering both LP and non-LP equations on standard benchmarks by combining GINN-LP with other methods.

In experiments, GINN-LP outperforms existing methods in recovering multivariate LPs on real-world physics datasets. The ensemble approach sets new state-of-the-art results by improving solution rate by 7.1% on symbolic regression benchmarks.
