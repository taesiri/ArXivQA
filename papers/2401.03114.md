# [GLISP: A Scalable GNN Learning System by Exploiting Inherent Structural   Properties of Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Deploying GNNs on industrial-scale graphs is challenging due to the huge data size and complex topology. Existing distributed GNN frameworks have limitations in graph partitioning, neighbor sampling architectures, and full-graph inference:

1) Graph partitioning algorithms are not optimized for sampling-based GNN training on power-law graphs. This leads to imbalanced partitioning and affects system performance. 

2) Neighbor sampling architectures are load imbalanced and memory inefficient. Simply balancing seed vertices across servers is inadequate to handle hotspots. No framework exploits vertex-cut partitioning for distributed sampling.  

3) Full-graph inference is intractable on giant graphs. Existing frameworks lack optimizations like reuse of intermediate embeddings and efficient large-scale embedding retrieval.

Proposed Solution - GLISP:
A scalable GNN learning system that exploits the inherent structural properties of graphs:

1) Graph Partitioner: A vertex-cut partitioning algorithm (AdaDNE) that adaptively adjusts the partitioning speed to produce balanced partitions for power-law graphs. This ensures workload balance for sampling-based systems.

2) Graph Sampling Service: A Gather-Apply based architecture that enables distributed sampling of hotspots for load balancing. An efficient heterogeneous graph data structure is proposed to reduce memory overhead. 

3) Graph Inference Engine: A layer-wise inference scheme reuses intermediate embeddings stored distributedly to eliminate redundancy. It incorporates a two-level caching system and graph reordering to accelerate embedding retrieval.

Main Contributions:

1) AdaDNE partition algorithm optimized for sampling-based GNN training on power-law graphs. Significantly improves balance while keeping redundancy low.

2) Load balanced sampling architecture by distributing hotspot sampling using vertex-cut partitioning. Memory efficient heterogeneous graph data structure.  

3) Redundancy-free layer-wise inference engine with hybrid caching system that exploits graph locality for efficient large-scale embedding retrieval.

Experiments show up to 70x inference speedup over state-of-the-art GNN systems. The system scales to over 10 billion nodes and 40 billion edges.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GLISP, a scalable graph neural network learning system for industrial-scale power law graphs that addresses performance bottlenecks in graph partitioning, neighbor sampling, and full-graph inference by exploiting inherent graph properties such as skewed degree distribution and data locality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A vertex-cut based graph partition algorithm AdaDNE that can better handle power law graphs and reduce data skew and redundancy compared to existing edge-cut algorithms. 

2. A load balanced neighbor sampling architecture based on the Gather-Apply paradigm and a compact memory efficient data structure for vertex-cut partitioned graphs. This enables efficient and scalable subgraph sampling.

3. A graph inference engine that performs layerwise inference to eliminate redundant computation and incorporates a two-level embedding caching system to accelerate embedding retrieval. The caching system leverages a proposed lightweight graph reordering algorithm PDS to exploit data locality.

In summary, the paper proposes a full graph learning system called GLISP that addresses scalability and performance limitations of existing systems by exploiting inherent structural properties of graphs, such as power law distribution and data locality. Extensive experiments show significant speedups over state-of-the-art graph learning frameworks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The AdaDNE partition algorithm introduces an adaptive expansion factor to balance the number of vertices and edges in each partition. How is this expansion factor calculated and updated during the partitioning process? What is the intuition behind using the adaptive expansion factor?

2. The Gather-Apply architecture for distributed neighbor sampling enables handling of hotspots' neighbor sampling by multiple servers. How does this architecture achieve better load balancing compared to alternatives? What are the implementation details of the Gather and Apply phases?

3. The proposed data structure replaces some fields like local vertex/edge IDs and edge types with queries. What is the time complexity of these queries and how much memory savings do they provide? Is there any runtime overhead caused by the extra queries?

4. The paper claims redundant computation is eliminated in the layerwise inference scheme. But don't we still need to do neighbor sampling for all vertices at each layer? What specific optimizations make the layerwise approach more efficient?

5. The two-level embedding caching system exploits data locality provided by the graph partitioner and graph reordering. How exactly does graph reordering improve locality for interior vertices versus boundary vertices? What causes the hit ratio difference between LRU and FIFO cache update policies?

6. How suitable is the proposed system for dynamic graphs where edges/vertices get frequently updated? What components would need modification to efficiently handle highly dynamic graphs?

7. The weighted neighbor sampling uses the AlgorithmA-ES method. How does this method work? What are its advantages over the alias method for weighted sampling in distributed settings?

8. How does the proposed system handle sampling of multi-hop neighbors for heterogeneous graphs with multiple edge types? Does it treat each edge type independently or jointly sample them?

9. What are the scalability limitations of the current system design? Where do you see bottlenecks emerging for graphs with 100 billion or trillion edges? 

10. Could ideas from this paper, like the layerwise inference and embedding caching, be applied to optimize training instead of just inference? What complications would arise in that scenario?
