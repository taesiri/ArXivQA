# [A Local Appearance Model for Volumetric Capture of Diverse Hairstyle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08679)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for efficiently creating high-fidelity 3D human avatars with diverse, realistic hairstyles. The key idea is learning a universal local hair appearance prior model from a dataset of hundreds of people with varied hairstyles. This local model leverages similarities of hair patterns within local regions, as opposed to the much larger global variance across hairstyles. It takes as input 3D-aligned hair features diffused from a sparse colored point cloud, and outputs dense volumetric radiance fields covering hair regions that can be rendered photorealistically. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to previous state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing both seen and novel hairstyles. The model also enables practical avatar personalization applications like generating avatars from simple iPhone scans with just a few views. The local appearance modeling allows capturing details even with sparse/noisy inputs. Key advantages are better generalization across diverse hairstyles thanks to the learned local prior, high-quality rendering of hair details, and flexibility for efficient new user avatar personalization.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Creating high-fidelity and photorealistic 3D avatars, especially modeling diverse hairstyles, is essential for mixed reality applications but remains challenging. Existing methods either focus only on the facial region, rely on personalized models limiting scalability, or struggle to handle the complexity and diversity of hair geometry and appearance. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a novel method to efficiently create avatars with high-quality hair modeling by learning a universal local hair appearance prior. The key idea is to leverage the observation that different hairstyles share more visual similarity patterns locally than globally. 

The method represents hair as a composition of volumetric primitives centered around sparse colored point samples of the hair. Hair feature volumes are generated by diffusing point features into grid voxels. Two neural networks are trained to output hair alpha and RGB volumes conditioned on the feature volumes. By compositing outputs of networks run on local primitives, photorealistic hair radiance fields covering diverse geometries can be generated.

Contributions:
- Volumetric hair representation enabling efficient modeling and rendering of complex hairstyles
- Learning framework to generate hair radiance fields from sparse point inputs by leveraging a local appearance prior
- Empirical demonstration of improved generalization to diverse hair modeling and scalability to new identities compared to state-of-the-art avatar creation techniques
- Application for efficient avatar personalization from sparse mobile phone RGBD captures

Overall, the paper presents a novel deep learning based framework for scalable high-fidelity hair modeling for avatar creation by capitalizing on the observation of local similarity patterns in hair appearance across different global hairstyles. Experiments demonstrate the improved quality, diversity and efficiency of the presented approach over previous avatar modeling techniques.
