# [A Local Appearance Model for Volumetric Capture of Diverse Hairstyle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08679)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for efficiently creating high-fidelity 3D human avatars with diverse, realistic hairstyles. The key idea is learning a universal local hair appearance prior model from a dataset of hundreds of people with varied hairstyles. This local model leverages similarities of hair patterns within local regions, as opposed to the much larger global variance across hairstyles. It takes as input 3D-aligned hair features diffused from a sparse colored point cloud, and outputs dense volumetric radiance fields covering hair regions that can be rendered photorealistically. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to previous state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing both seen and novel hairstyles. The model also enables practical avatar personalization applications like generating avatars from simple iPhone scans with just a few views. The local appearance modeling allows capturing details even with sparse/noisy inputs. Key advantages are better generalization across diverse hairstyles thanks to the learned local prior, high-quality rendering of hair details, and flexibility for efficient new user avatar personalization.
