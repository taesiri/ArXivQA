# [DME-Driver: Integrating Human Decision Logic and 3D Scene Perception in   Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03641)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous driving systems lack interpretability and do not fully leverage human driver behavior patterns. Planning-oriented models focus on overall performance but decisions are not explainable. LLM-based models are more interpretable but do not fully utilize perception tasks. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Proposes DME-Driver system which combines strengths of both approaches. Has two components - Decision-Maker and Executor.

Decision-Maker:
- Based on large vision language model (LLVM)
- Trained on human driver behavior data 
- Understands and emulates human driver logic for interpretability
- Provides instructions focused on important elements 

Executor:
- Planning-oriented perception model
- Accurately translates instructions into control signals
- Bridges gap between decision-making and control

Key Contributions:

- Presents DME-Driver system for robust and interpretable autonomous driving
- Develops Human Driver Behavior (HBD) dataset linking driver logic and signals  
- Decision-Maker model design to mimic human driver reasoning 
- Formulates Executor model to translate decisions into signals

Evaluation:
- Decision-Maker accurately replicates human gaze, logic and decisions
- Planning accuracy is state-of-the-art, with detailed logs for traceability
- Ablation study validates contribution of each component

In summary, the paper proposes an autonomous driving system combining LLM reasoning abilities and planning-oriented perception for enhanced performance and interpretability. The two component design and new dataset enable the emulation of human driver logic alongside precise environmental sensing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new autonomous driving system called DME-Driver that combines a decision-making model based on large language models to emulate human logic with a planning-oriented perception model to translate decisions into precise control signals, aiming to enhance robustness, interpretability, and overall performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of the DME-Driver Autonomous Driving System. Specifically, the key contributions highlighted in the paper are:

1. DME-Driver Autonomous Driving System: The paper presents a novel system that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) in logical reasoning and interpretability with the precise environmental sensing capabilities of planning-oriented models. This aims to improve decision-making robustness and interpretability. 

2. Human-Driver Behavior and Decision-Making (HBD) Dataset: The paper introduces a new dataset that integrates human driver behavior logic with detailed environmental perception information to facilitate training of the DME-Driver system.

3. Decision-Maker Model Design: The Decision-Maker model based on a large vision language model is presented, which is capable of imitating human driver instructions and focusing on important environmental elements to provide human-like insights for decision-making.

4. Executor Model Formulation: The formulation of the Executor model is presented, which accurately processes environmental data and translates the Decision-Maker's instructions into control signals to ensure effective and context-aware responses.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and formulation of the novel DME-Driver Autonomous Driving System to enhance decision-making capabilities and interpretability by synergizing large language models and planning-oriented perception models. The new human driver behavior dataset and the designs of the Decision-Maker and Executor models specifically tailored for this framework are also presented as main contributions.
