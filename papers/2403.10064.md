# [Progressive Divide-and-Conquer via Subsampling Decomposition for   Accelerated MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10064)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aims to reconstruct high-quality MR images from undersampled measurements in k-space. Existing deep unfolding networks (DUNs) unroll optimization algorithms into end-to-end trainable networks but still struggle with highly ill-posed degradation, leading to unsatisfactory reconstructions. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Progressive Divide-And-Conquer (PDAC) strategy that decomposes the severe undersampling degradation into a series of moderate corruptions and performs reconstruction sequentially. Specifically,

1. It reformulates the MAP problem by introducing a series of regularizers, allowing to progressively recover easier to more difficult parts of the information loss. 

2. It derives an optimization algorithm with iterative updates, where each iteration focuses on recovering one specific decomposed degradation. This is unfolded into a deep network.

3. It incorporates learning the decomposition of degradations as an auxiliary task using a degradation predictor and severity conditioning module. This guides the network to preserve well-reconstructed information while discarding inaccuracies.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a PDAC strategy to break down severe MRI undersampling degradation and progressively reconstruct it.

- Provides derivation and unfolding of PDAC into an end-to-end deep network. 

- Introduces learning of degradation decomposition to guide network to sequentially recover information from easier to harder parts.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on fastMRI and Stanford 2D FSE datasets for both single-coil and multi-coil MRI reconstruction.
