# [One Model is All You Need: Multi-Task Learning Enables Simultaneous   Histology Image Segmentation and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can a multi-task learning approach enable simultaneous high-quality histology image segmentation and classification using a single model?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Aligning the tasks by using the same tissue type, staining, and resolution will allow meaningful simultaneous prediction with a single multi-task model, without performance degradation compared to single-task models. 2) The features learned via multi-task learning will generalize better and can be leveraged to improve performance on additional tasks via transfer learning.3) By utilizing data from multiple sources, multi-task learning can help overcome the data scarcity problem in computational pathology.The authors propose a multi-task learning model called Cerberus that shares an encoder between tasks but has independent decoders. They train it on aligned tasks of gland, lumen, and nuclear segmentation along with tissue classification. The results demonstrate high performance on par or better than single-task models, and benefits for transfer learning. Overall, the experiments seem to validate the main hypotheses about the advantages of multi-task learning for computational pathology tasks.
