# [Data-Centric Digital Agriculture: A Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03437)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a perspective on the emerging paradigm of data-centric digital agriculture, which emphasizes the critical role of high-quality data in developing accurate, generalizable, and adaptable machine learning models. It traces the evolution from traditional agriculture relying on qualitative assessments to precision agriculture enabled by sensors and data, ultimately leading to the current model-centric digital agriculture. However, despite advancements, model accuracy has plateaued, highlighting limitations in data utilization. Data-centric digital agriculture aims to address this by systematically identifying and curating valuable datasets to build robust models. Key areas of focus include novel sensing technologies, active sensing strategies, considerations around data generalization/specialization, model transfer learning, privacy-preserving and sustainable ML, comprehensive model evaluation, and uncertainty quantification. Fostering data accessibility and farmer adoption of these technologies through supportive policies and demonstrating economic benefits is also critical. Ultimately, data-centric digital agriculture, with its emphasis on high-quality, dynamic datasets tailored to specific agricultural tasks, can transform the field by enabling accurate and adaptable decision-support. This has immense potential for innovative, sustainable agricultural practices.
