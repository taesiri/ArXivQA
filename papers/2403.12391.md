# [FairSTG: Countering performance heterogeneity via collaborative   sample-level optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12391)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spatiotemporal data plays a crucial role in mobile computing services for smart cities, but can suffer from unfairness issues such as performance heterogeneity across different samples and regions. 
- Existing spatiotemporal learning methods focus on overall accuracy but overlook the significant performance heterogeneity, which can degrade practical functions and bring risks for real-world applications.
- Two key challenges are: (1) identifying challenging samples suffering unfair performance without explicit sensitive attributes, and (2) exploiting contexts to enhance representations of those challenging samples.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose FairSTG, a fairness-aware spatiotemporal graph learning framework to counter performance heterogeneity.
- Takes node-level time series as samples, allows location-specific fairness and joint enhancement. 
- Key components:
   - Spatiotemporal feature extractor
   - Fairness recognizer - identifies challenging samples via self-supervision
   - Collaborative feature enhancement - transfers features from well-learned to challenging samples
   - Fairness objectives - variance loss and cost-sensitive reweighting
- Two-stage training strategy to ensure quality of fairness recognizer relying on feature extractor.

Main Contributions:
- First work to highlight and attribute performance heterogeneity/unfairness issue in spatiotemporal learning.
- Propose tailored solution FairSTG with sample-level retrieval and compensation to improve fairness.  
- Achieve comparable or better accuracy than baselines while significantly improving fairness metrics.
- Show improved performance on challenging samples and underrepresented regions.
- Demonstrate potential to alleviate risks and facilitate sustainable urban computing.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed FairSTG solution and its main components, the notable contributions around conceptualizing and addressing the spatiotemporal unfairness issue, and some of the main results around accuracy, fairness and benefits.
