# [Enhanced Training of Query-Based Object Detection via Selective Query   Recollection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07593)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the training of query-based object detectors to enhance their performance, specifically in cases where they incorrectly predict objects in later stages after initially predicting them correctly in earlier stages?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The responsibility and supervision of each decoder stage in query-based detectors is currently unbalanced, with later stages being more responsible but trained equivalently to earlier stages. Placing more training emphasis on later stages may improve performance. 2) Due to the sequential cascading of queries through decoder stages, errors in intermediate stages propagate and amplify downstream. Providing later stages access to prior intermediate queries during training could mitigate these cascading errors.To address these issues, the paper proposes two main training strategies:- Dense Query Recollection (DQR): Collects and forwards all intermediate queries to downstream stages, increasing supervision exponentially and exposing all prior queries.- Selective Query Recollection (SQR): Only forwards queries from the prior two stages, reducing computation while still providing emphasis and mitigating cascading errors.The central hypothesis seems to be that SQR will enhance the training and performance of query-based detectors by addressing the limitations identified above. The experiments aim to validate whether SQR consistently improves various detectors across different settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents Selective Query Recollection (SQR), a training strategy for query-based object detectors. The key contributions are:1. It investigates a phenomenon where query-based detectors mispredict objects at the last decoding stage even though they predicted correctly at an intermediate stage. The paper analyzes this issue and attributes it to two limitations - lack of training emphasis on later stages and cascading errors due to the sequential decoding structure. 2. It proposes SQR to address these limitations. SQR cumulatively collects intermediate queries and selectively forwards them to downstream stages during training. This provides more supervision signals to later stages and allows them to see queries from prior stages directly. 3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of SQR by applying it to various detectors like DAB-DETR, Deformable DETR and Adamixer. SQR consistently improves their performance by 1.4-2.8 AP without modifying the inference pipeline.In summary, the main contribution is proposing SQR as an elegant and effective training strategy to enhance query-based object detectors by overcoming limitations in their training process. The consistent gains across detectors and settings demonstrate its generalization ability.
