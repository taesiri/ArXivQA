# [Enhanced Training of Query-Based Object Detection via Selective Query   Recollection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07593)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we improve the training of query-based object detectors to enhance their performance, specifically in cases where they incorrectly predict objects in later stages after initially predicting them correctly in earlier stages?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The responsibility and supervision of each decoder stage in query-based detectors is currently unbalanced, with later stages being more responsible but trained equivalently to earlier stages. Placing more training emphasis on later stages may improve performance. 

2) Due to the sequential cascading of queries through decoder stages, errors in intermediate stages propagate and amplify downstream. Providing later stages access to prior intermediate queries during training could mitigate these cascading errors.

To address these issues, the paper proposes two main training strategies:

- Dense Query Recollection (DQR): Collects and forwards all intermediate queries to downstream stages, increasing supervision exponentially and exposing all prior queries.

- Selective Query Recollection (SQR): Only forwards queries from the prior two stages, reducing computation while still providing emphasis and mitigating cascading errors.

The central hypothesis seems to be that SQR will enhance the training and performance of query-based detectors by addressing the limitations identified above. The experiments aim to validate whether SQR consistently improves various detectors across different settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents Selective Query Recollection (SQR), a training strategy for query-based object detectors. The key contributions are:

1. It investigates a phenomenon where query-based detectors mispredict objects at the last decoding stage even though they predicted correctly at an intermediate stage. The paper analyzes this issue and attributes it to two limitations - lack of training emphasis on later stages and cascading errors due to the sequential decoding structure. 

2. It proposes SQR to address these limitations. SQR cumulatively collects intermediate queries and selectively forwards them to downstream stages during training. This provides more supervision signals to later stages and allows them to see queries from prior stages directly. 

3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of SQR by applying it to various detectors like DAB-DETR, Deformable DETR and Adamixer. SQR consistently improves their performance by 1.4-2.8 AP without modifying the inference pipeline.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing SQR as an elegant and effective training strategy to enhance query-based object detectors by overcoming limitations in their training process. The consistent gains across detectors and settings demonstrate its generalization ability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates why query-based object detectors sometimes make incorrect final predictions despite correct intermediate predictions, proposes a training strategy called Selective Query Recollection (SQR) to address this issue by allowing later stages to access prior queries, and shows SQR consistently improves multiple query-based detectors like Adamixer, DAB-DETR and Deformable-DETR.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of query-based object detection:

- The phenomenon observed in Fig. 1 where detections can get worse in later stages is an interesting finding. It highlights an understudied aspect of multi-stage detectors - that later stages don't always improve on earlier predictions. This phenomenon has not been analyzed quantitatively in prior work to my knowledge.

- The key ideas proposed - adding training emphasis and mitigating cascading errors for later stages - are intuitive and have not been explicitly tackled before in this context. Prior work on query-based detectors has focused more on improving the decoder architecture itself. 

- The proposed SQR method is simple but effective. It's easy to implement and broadly compatible with different query-based detectors without changing inference. This plug-and-play nature is appealing. Its strengths are nicely demonstrated through controlled experiments and testing across multiple models.

- The consistent gains obtained across models (+1.4 to +2.8 AP) are quite substantial given how mature and highly optimized these detectors already are. The visualization in Fig. 5 also demonstrates SQR's benefits cannot simply be achieved through longer training.

- SQR seems complementary to many recent ideas like DN-DETR, SMCA-DETR etc. The additional experiments with DN-DETR support this. So SQR potentially boosts state-of-the-art further.

- The analysis of training efficiency and model size reduction are worthwhile extensions to study SQR's limits.

Overall, I think this is a valuable contribution given the thorough investigation of the stated problem, simple yet overlooked ideas proposed, clear gains demonstrated across models, and opportunities opened up for future work. The paper compares favorably to existing literature through its unique analysis and insights.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate SQR with other types of query-based object detectors beyond the ones studied in this work, such as Sparse RCNN, UP-DETR, etc. The authors suggest SQR can be easily adapted to various query-based detectors.

- Explore SQR for other computer vision tasks formulated as set prediction problems, like panoptic segmentation, point cloud detection, etc. The authors believe the core ideas behind SQR can generalize.

- Study how to reduce the extra computational cost incurred by SQR during training while preserving the performance gains. The authors point out the cost is higher for lightweight backbones.

- Further analyze the behavior of query-based detectors during training to gain more insights into the overlooked phenomenon identified in this work. The authors provide some preliminary analysis but more can be done. 

- Investigate other ways to mitigate the issue of cascading errors besides SQR, such as designing better sequence modeling in the decoder.

- Extend SQR to video object detection by selectively propagating queries temporally across frames.

- Explore the direction of using query recollection to reduce model size, as preliminarily shown via the DQRR experiment.

In summary, the authors suggest further exploring SQR, analyzing query-based detectors during training, and reducing cascading errors as promising future directions motivated by this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This CVPR 2023 paper proposes a new training strategy called Selective Query Recollection (SQR) to improve query-based object detectors like DETR. The authors first analyze these detectors and find cases where predictions get worse in later stages compared to earlier stages during inference. They attribute this to two issues - lack of training emphasis on later stages and cascading errors from the sequential query processing. To address this, SQR collects intermediate queries from prior stages and feeds them as additional input to later stages during training. This provides more supervision signals and direct access to earlier queries for later stages. SQR can be selectively applied by choosing which prior stage queries to include, balancing performance and compute cost. Experiments on COCO show SQR consistently improves multiple detectors like Deformable DETR, DAB-DETR, and Adamixer across settings and backbones, without changing inference. The gains range from 1.4 to 2.8 AP, showing SQR's effectiveness in enhancing query-based detector training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates an issue where query-based object detectors sometimes mispredict objects in later stages of decoding even though they predicted them correctly in earlier stages. The authors attribute this issue to two main limitations - the lack of emphasis placed on training the later decoding stages, and cascading errors that accumulate through the sequential decoding structure. 

To address these issues, the authors propose a training strategy called Selective Query Recollection (SQR). SQR cumulatively collects intermediate queries from earlier decoding stages and selectively forwards them alongside the main query sequence to later stages during training. This provides more direct supervision for later stages and exposes them to a greater diversity of queries from earlier stages. Experiments show SQR consistently improves multiple query-based detectors like Adamixer, DAB-DETR, and Deformable-DETR across different settings, without changing the inference pipeline. The key advantages are enhanced performance from improved training of later decoding stages, while maintaining the same inference speed.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a training strategy called Selective Query Recollection (SQR) for query-based object detectors. SQR addresses two limitations of current training procedures: lack of emphasis on later decoder stages and cascading errors due to the sequential decoder structure. SQR cumulatively collects intermediate queries as the decoder stages proceed and selectively forwards a subset of them to downstream stages, alongside the original pathway. In particular, SQR forwards the queries from the prior two stages to each stage. This allows later stages to work directly with intermediate queries from earlier stages, placing more emphasis on later stages via increased supervision. It also exposes later stages to a variety of earlier queries during training to mitigate cascading errors. SQR can be readily incorporated into various query-based detectors without changing the inference pipeline. Experiments demonstrate consistent and significant AP improvements on models like Deformable DETR, DAB-DETR and Adamixer.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem that query-based object detectors often make mistakes at the last decoding stage, even though they predicted correctly at an intermediate stage. 

Specifically, the paper investigates two issues:

1. Lack of training emphasis: The responsibility of each decoding stage is unbalanced, with later stages being more responsible for the final prediction. But during training, all stages are supervised equally. This lacks a mechanism to place more emphasis on training the later stages.

2. Cascading errors: Due to the sequential structure of the decoder, errors made by an intermediate stage get cascaded to later stages. The query before the error is never propagated forward, even if it was a better representation. This makes it harder for later stages to converge.

The key research question is: How can we improve query-based object detectors by addressing these two limitations during training?

The paper proposes a training strategy called Selective Query Recollection (SQR) to address these issues by allowing later decoder stages to also work with intermediate queries from earlier stages. This provides more training emphasis on later stages and mitigates cascading errors. Experiments show SQR consistently improves performance of various query-based detectors.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying limitations of query-based detector training, and proposing a simple and effective strategy to address them and improve performance. The core research question is how to enhance training of query-based object detectors.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reading the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Query-based object detection - The paper investigates query-based object detectors like DETR which detect objects by predicting a set of bounding boxes and class labels from a set of learned object queries.

- Decoder stages - Query-based detectors like DETR have a decoder made up of multiple stages (typically 6) that iteratively refine the object queries to produce the final detections. 

- Mispredictions - The authors analyze cases where detectors make mistakes at later stages after predicting correctly at earlier stages, showing optimization limitations.

- Training emphasis - They find that later decoder stages should have more training emphasis since they are more responsible for final predictions, but currently all stages are trained equivalently.

- Cascading errors - Due to the sequential nature of the decoder, errors at early stages cascade and accumulate to later stages, making optimization difficult.

- Query recollection - The proposed training approach to address the limitations by collecting intermediate queries and propagating them to later stages for enhanced training.

- Selective query recollection (SQR) - An efficient version of query recollection where only queries from the prior two stages are selectively propagated forward.

- Improved optimization - SQR provides more training signals and mitigates cascading errors to improve optimization of query-based detectors like DETR, without changing inference.

In summary, the key focus is analyzing limitations in the training of query-based object detectors, and proposing the query recollection approach to enhance their optimization and performance.
