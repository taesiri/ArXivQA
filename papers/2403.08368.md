# [METER: a mobile vision transformer architecture for monocular depth   estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Monocular depth estimation (MDE) aims to predict a dense depth map from a single RGB image. MDE is useful for various applications like robotics and augmented reality. Recent MDE methods use vision transformers (ViTs) which achieve state-of-the-art performance but are computationally complex for embedded devices with hardware constraints. The paper aims to develop a lightweight ViT architecture for accurate and fast MDE on embedded devices like NVIDIA Jetson TX1/Nano.

Proposed Method: 
The paper proposes METER - a MobilE vision TransformER architecture with three configurations (S, XS, XXS) of different complexities. The key components are:

1. Encoder: A lightweight ViT encoder inspired by MobileViT, with a new METER block replacing computationally expensive MobileViT blocks while improving accuracy.

2. Decoder: A lightweight CNN decoder to recover spatial details and produce the depth map.

3. Loss Function: A multi-component "balanced loss function" to improve depth map accuracy.

4. Data Augmentation: A "shifting strategy" augmentation that transforms both the RGB image and depth map to improve robustness.

Contributions:

1. Lightweight ViT architecture for MDE achieving state-of-the-art performance among lightweight models on NYU Depth v2 and KITTI datasets.

2. Inference at 16-25 FPS on Jetson TX1/Nano devices with only 0.7-3.3 million parameters.

3. Detailed ablation studies validate the contributions of the proposed encoder, decoder, loss function and data augmentation.

4. Demonstration of METER's real-world applicability by testing it in a real indoor scene and comparing against depth sensor output.

The paper shows METER can enable high-accuracy MDE on resource-constrained embedded devices, making it suitable for applications like robotics, drones, augmented reality etc. The balanced trade-off between efficiency and accuracy makes it a valuable benchmark for further research.
