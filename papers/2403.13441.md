# [Robustness Verifcation in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the computational complexity of various verification problems for neural networks, focusing specifically on robustness and minimization. Key problems examined include:

- Reachability (does there exist an input that satisfies constraints and leads the network to produce a valid output)
- Interval properties (do all valid inputs lead to valid outputs)  
- Network equivalence (do two networks compute the same function)
- Robustness (how much can inputs be perturbed before the output changes significantly)
- Network minimization (can a smaller network compute the same function)

The metrics used to define robustness and the activation functions allowed impact complexity.

Proposed Solution:

- Shows many problems are in co-NP or NP for piecewise linear activations and the L1 or Linf metrics. This includes reachability, interval properties, equivalence, robustness.

- Provides reductions between various robustness properties when using ReLU activations. For example, classification robustness reduces to standard robustness.

- Shows global standard robustness reduces to equivalence. Miniimization is in Sigma2-P and all-node-necessity is in Pi2-P for piecewise linear activations.

Main Contributions:

- Establishes complexity results for verification problems, focusing on the reachability, interval property, equivalence, and robustness problems. 

- Analyzes impact of choice of metric and activation function on complexity.

- Shows connections via reductions between different robustness definitions.

- Provides upper and lower complexity bounds on network minimization and necessity problems.  

Overall, provides a theoretical framework for examining complexity of verification questions in neural networks, taking into account factors like activation functions. Key robustness and minimization problems are shown to range from co-NP to Pi2-P.
