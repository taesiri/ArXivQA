# [OT-Attack: Enhancing Adversarial Transferability of Vision-Language   Models via Optimal Transport Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04403)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel adversarial attack method called OT-Attack that enhances the transferability of adversarial examples against vision-language models. The key insight is that prior attacks like SGA fail to optimally align augmented image sets with text sets, leading to overfitting on the source model. OT-Attack addresses this by treating image and text features as distinct distributions and leveraging optimal transport theory to derive the optimal mapping between them, which guides adversarial example generation. Specifically, it uses similarity as the cost matrix and computes the total transfer cost between distributions via Sinkhorn optimization. Experiments across models like ALBEF, TCL, and CLIP on image-text retrieval using Flickr30K and MSCOCO show OT-Attack achieves new state-of-the-art attack transferability. The method also demonstrates strong cross-task transferability on image captioning and visual grounding. Notably, OT-Attack can successfully attack commercial systems like GPT-4 and Bing Chat. Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing adversarial attacks against vision-language models by optimally integrating data augmentation, modality alignment, and optimal transport theory for superior transferability. The results underscore vulnerabilities of advanced AI systems to such sophisticated attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an Optimal Transport-based Adversarial Attack method (OT-Attack) that improves the transferability of adversarial examples for vision-language models by formulating image and text features as distributions and using optimal transport to identify the best mapping between them, outperforming prior state-of-the-art attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are summarized in three key aspects:

1. The proposed OT-Attack improves the SGA framework by ensuring a balanced match between image and text sets after data augmentation. 

2. The paper innovatively utilizes Optimal Transport theory to examine adversarial example transferability in VLP models. This promotes a more thorough alignment between data-augmented images and textual descriptions.

3. Extensive experiments establish that the proposed method generates adversarial examples with superior transferability compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, the OT-Attack can successfully attack current business models like GPT-4 and Bing Chat.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel OT-Attack method that leverages optimal transport theory to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples for vision-language models. This is achieved by better balancing the effects of data augmentation and establishing an optimal mapping between augmented images and texts. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in attacking various VLP models, including breaking commercial systems.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models have shown impressive capabilities in processing images and text. However, they are vulnerable to multi-modal adversarial attacks. Recent works have shown that using data augmentation and image-text interactions can enhance attack transferability, but they overlook the optimal alignment between augmented image-text pairs. This leads to adversarial examples being overly tailored to the source model, limiting transferability gains.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an Optimal Transport-based Adversarial Attack (OT-Attack) to improve attack transferability for VLP models. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate the feature distributions of augmented images and text as distinct distributions. 

2) Apply optimal transport theory to find the most efficient mapping between these distributions based on their similarity. This mapping is used to guide adversarial example generation.

3) The optimal transport formulation accounts for the overall distribution of features instead of just using averaged similarities. This reduces overfitting to the source model.

Main Contributions:  

1) Proposes OT-Attack to improve adversarial transferability by balancing data augmentation and image-text interactions through optimal transport theory.

2) Achieves new state-of-the-art attack success rates on image-text retrieval tasks across models like ALBEF, TCL, CLIP-ViT and CLIP-CNN using Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets.

3) Demonstrates cross-task transferability on image captioning and visual grounding tasks. Adversarial examples crafted for one task can successfully attack models designed for other tasks as well.  

4) OT-Attack can effectively attack advanced models like GPT-4 and Bing Chat by adding more text perturbations, revealing vulnerabilities.

The proposed OT-Attack presents an important advancement in generating more transferable adversarial attacks to uncover risks with VLP models deployed in the real world. Defending against such sophisticated multi-modal attacks is an open challenge.
