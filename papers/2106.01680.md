# [Convergent Graph Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01680)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new deep learning model called the Convergent Graph Solver (CGS) to predict the properties of a graph system at its stationary state (fixed point) without requiring prior domain knowledge. The key ideas are:- Construct input-dependent linear contracting transition maps that are guaranteed to converge to unique fixed points. This allows CGS to solve for the fixed points of complex graph systems without needing to design problem-specific iterative methods. - Compute the fixed points via iterative methods and use implicit differentiation to calculate gradients, enabling end-to-end training with constant memory usage.- Decode the computed fixed points to predict properties of interest about the graph system.The central hypothesis is that by learning to construct provably convergent iterative maps tailored to each input graph, CGS can effectively predict stationary properties and emulate complex iterative solvers without requiring their explicit formulation. Experiments on physical diffusion and Markov decision process problems validate that CGS matches or outperforms baseline models.In summary, the key research questions are:1) Can a model learn to construct provably convergent iterative maps from data to predict stationary properties of graph systems? 2) Does enforcing convergence as an inductive bias improve generalization over baselines without this guarantee?3) Can CGS effectively solve benchmark tasks where the notion of a fixed point is not well-defined?The results confirm that encoding convergence as an inductive bias enables competitive performance without domain knowledge, supporting the potential of learned iterative solvers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new deep learning method called Convergent Graph Solver (CGS) for predicting properties of graph systems at their stationary states (fixed points). The key ideas are:- CGS learns to construct input-dependent linear contracting iterative maps, which are guaranteed to converge to unique fixed points. This overcomes limitations of prior methods that cannot guarantee convergence. - The fixed points are computed via iterative methods and decoded to make predictions. This allows end-to-end training via implicit differentiation.- CGS is evaluated on physical diffusion and Markov decision process problems where true fixed points exist, showing competitive accuracy. It also performs well on graph classification tasks where fixed points are not clearly defined.In summary, the main contribution is developing a deep learning approach that can learn to find guaranteed fixed points for graph systems in an end-to-end manner, and demonstrating its effectiveness on a diverse set of graph analysis tasks. The method combines ideas like learned iterative maps, implicit models, and graph neural networks in a novel way.Some key aspects that distinguish CGS from prior work are:- Guaranteed convergence due to the structure of learned iterative maps - Flexibility in network design for map construction- End-to-end training without needing intermediate supervision- Generalization across tasks with and without real fixed pointsSo in essence, the paper proposes a way to learn fixed point computations for graphs that is more principled, flexible, and broadly applicable compared to existing techniques.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of deep learning for physics-based modeling:- The key novelty of this paper is the development of the Convergent Graph Solver (CGS) method, which learns input-dependent contracting linear maps to predict properties related to graph fixed points. This represents a new approach compared to prior work like IGNN and SSE which use fixed neural network architectures or input-dependent biases only. The ability of CGS to construct flexible linear maps tailored to each input graph seems to be an important advance.- A lot of prior work has focused just on predicting outputs without necessarily enforcing physical consistency or convergence guarantees. By designing CGS around contractive maps with guaranteed fixed points, the authors ensure the outputs are physically consistent stable solutions. This sets CGS apart from pure data-driven deep learning methods.- Compared to physics-constrained methods like Lagrangian-based GNNs, CGS takes a different approach to ensuring physical plausibility. Rather than enforcing constraints during training, CGS builds in inductive biases through its model architecture. This means it doesn't require solving a constrained optimization problem.- For applications like graph classification, CGS appears competitive with state-of-the-art GNN methods. The interpretation of CGS finding "virtual fixed points" in this context is interesting - it suggests the contractive mapping approach provides a useful inductive bias even when real fixed points don't exist.- The ablation studies provide solid evidence that the design choices in CGS like input-dependent maps and linear transition functions are important for its strong performance. The comparisons to nonlinear variants in particular are informative.Overall, I would say CGS makes an original contribution by proposing a new inductive bias (contractive linear maps tailored to inputs) that helps ensure physical plausibility while retaining modeling flexibility and strong predictive performance. The comparisons to other methods help validate the benefits of this approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing methods to generate contracting iterative maps for a broader range of problems beyond the specific network analysis problems tested in this paper. The authors suggest exploring the application of CGS to other scientific and engineering problems that can be formulated as finding fixed points.- Exploring alternative formulations for the transition map matrix A_theta(G) beyond the specific methods proposed in this paper. The authors suggest leveraging different attention mechanisms could provide performance gains depending on the properties of the input graph.- Analyzing the sensitivity of the model to errors in computing the fixed points and gradients. The authors suggest further analysis on how small errors could impact the gradient estimation.- Applying CGS to large-scale graph problems. The authors propose iterative methods rather than direct matrix inversion to improve scalability, but suggest further work could be done to scale CGS up.- Extending CGS to generate nonlinear transition maps. The authors tested a linear formulation in this paper but suggest extending it to nonlinear maps as future work.- Enhancing the model architecture search space. The authors highlight the benefit of flexible encoder network design, suggesting further exploration of architecture search could improve performance.- Applying CGS to broader tasks beyond the graph property prediction problems tested. The authors propose CGS could have potential as a general computational layer for graph data.In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding CGS to broader problem domains, graph sizes, nonlinear formulations, and enhancing the architecture and sensitivity analysis. The core CGS approach shows promise on the tested problems, but the authors highlight many opportunities to build on this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new deep learning method called the convergent graph solver (CGS) for predicting properties of graph systems at their stationary states. CGS has a forward propagation with three key steps: (1) It uses the input graph to construct a set of linear contracting iterative maps, each guaranteed to have a unique fixed point. (2) It computes the fixed points of these maps using iterative methods. (3) It decodes the aggregated fixed points using a separate decoder network to make predictions. A key advantage of CGS is that convergence is guaranteed by the contracting property of the learned iterative maps. The gradients for training are computed efficiently using the implicit function theorem. Experiments on physical diffusion and Markov decision process problems show CGS can effectively predict quantities related to graph system fixed points. Evaluation on graph classification benchmarks also indicates potential as a general graph convolution layer. Overall, the results demonstrate that CGS can serve as an accurate learning-based solver for network-analytic problems as well as a competitive graph neural network model.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new deep learning approach called the Convergent Graph Solver (CGS) for predicting properties of graph systems. CGS has a forward pass with three main steps: (1) It uses a graph neural network encoder to construct input-dependent linear contracting transition maps for the graph. (2) It computes the unique fixed points of these transition maps through iterative methods.
