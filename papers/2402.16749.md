## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing image compression algorithms face a trade-off between consistency with the original image and perceptual quality, especially at ultra-low bitrates (<0.024 bpp). Recently, with the rise of AI-generated images (AIGIs), compressing them effectively is also an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new compression framework called Multimodal Image Semantic Compression (MISC) to achieve both high consistency and perceptual quality at ultra-low bitrates for both natural images and AIGIs. The key components are:

1) LMM Encoder: Uses GPT-4 Vision to extract textual descriptions of overall image and key objects, compressing images into semantic information.

2) Map Encoder: Uses CLIP to align text descriptions to spatial image regions, outputting positional maps.  

3) Image Encoder: Extremely compresses images into bitstreams as additional input.

4) Decoder: Controls diffusion models conditioned on above modalities to reconstruct high quality images.

Main Contributions:

1) First image compression method powered by large multimodal models in both encoder and decoder for optimal consistency and perception.

2) Constructed a high-quality database of 500 AIGIs for compression evaluation.

3) Extensive experiments showed the proposed MISC framework can save 50% bitrate while achieving the best balance of consistency and perceptual quality for both natural images and AIGIs at ultra-low bitrates.

In summary, this paper pioneers a new LMM-driven compression paradigm to achieve optimal visual quality at extremely low bitrates for both traditional and AI-generated visual content. The complete framework and new datasets open up many possibilities for next-generation visual communication systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new image compression method called Multimodal Image Semantic Compression (MISC) that uses large multimodal models in both the encoder and decoder to achieve a balance between compression efficiency, consistency with the original image, and perceptual quality at ultra-low bitrates for both natural and AI-generated images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A new paradigm of image compression empowered by Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). MISC is the first image compression model to use LMM in both the encoder and decoder, which will promote the application of LMM in image compression.

2. A high-quality AI-Generated Image (AIGI) database with 500 images generated from mainstream text-to-image models, for evaluating AIGI compression algorithms. 

3. Achieving a perfect balance between consistency and perceptual quality at ultra-low bitrates below 0.024 bpp. Experimental results show MISC can save 50% bitrate while having both optimal consistency with ground truth images and high perceptual quality.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an LMM-driven compression framework MISC that can achieve extreme compression rates for both natural and AI-generated images, with superior performance in balancing consistency and perceptual quality. The new AIGI database is also constructed to facilitate research in this direction.

The paper proposes a new method called MISC for ultra-low bitrate image compression using LMMs. It aims to balance perceptual quality and consistency for compressing both natural images and AI-generated images. The method consists of different encoding modules to extract semantic, spatial, and pixel information which is then used by the decoding module to reconstruct the image. The performance is evaluated on a new high-quality AIGI database constructed in the paper as well as existing datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new image compression framework called MISC. Can you explain in detail the components of this framework including the encoders and decoder? What is the purpose of each component?

2. One key component of MISC is the LMM encoder which extracts semantic information from the image. How does the paper map the spatial domain of an image into a semantic domain? What information does the LMM encoder extract and why is this more efficient than traditional frequency domain compression?

3. The paper uses positional maps to encode the spatial locations of key semantic elements. Why are these maps needed in addition to the semantic descriptions from the LMM encoder? Provide an example scenario where the maps are beneficial. 

4. Explain the image encoder component of MISC and how it generates an extremely compressed image bitstream as additional input to the decoder. What is the purpose of having this image bitstream instead of just the semantic information?

5. The decoder uses a diffusion model conditioned on text and maps to reconstruct the image. Walk through the multi-stage decoding process starting from the initial compressed bitstream. How does each stage contribute to the final high quality and semantically consistent image?

6. The paper constructs a new database called AIGI-SCD for compression of AI generated images. Analyze the differences in statistical properties between AIGIs and natural images. Why can't existing natural image datasets be used?

7. The paper evaluates compression quality using both consistency and perception metrics. Explain why traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM are not suitable at very low bitrates. What metrics are used instead and why?

8. How does the compression performance of MISC compare with prior arts across different bitrates based on the results in Table 1? What new capability does MISC enable? Provide both quantitative and qualitative support.

9. The paper performs an ablation study in Table 2. Analyze the contribution of different compressed content groups. If you had to remove one group, which would have the least impact on performance?

10. The user study results show better alignment with objective metrics compared to AIGI. What could explain this gap? How can we develop better perceptual quality metrics for very low bitrate compression?
