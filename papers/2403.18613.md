# [Scalable Lipschitz Estimation for CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18613)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Scalable Lipschitz Estimation for CNNs":

Problem:
- Estimating the Lipschitz constant of neural networks is useful for measuring adversarial robustness and generalizability. 
- Existing methods like LipSDP are accurate but don't scale well to large CNNs due to the computational complexity of solving semidefinite programs (SDPs).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel method called Dynamic Convolutional Partition (DCP) to accelerate Lipschitz estimation for CNNs by decomposing a large convolutional block into smaller blocks.
- The key ideas are: 
   1) Divide a convolutional layer along the width and depth using a restricted integer partition. This splits a large block into smaller convolutional blocks.
   2) Prove an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of the original block in terms of the constants of the smaller blocks. 
   3) Solve the smaller LipSDP problems in parallel to get the upper bound.
- A dynamic search is used to find a good partition that balances accuracy and scalability.

Main Contributions:
- The DCP method to decompose a large convolutional block into smaller blocks for which LipSDP is tractable.
- A theorem proving an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of the original network in terms of the constants of the smaller blocks.
- Enhanced scalability over LipSDP baseline demonstrated through experiments on wide CNNs while providing comparable accuracy.
- Analysis of reduction in computational complexity in the best and worst cases.
- The method is general and can work with different Lipschitz estimation frameworks.

In summary, the paper develops a way to scale accurate Lipschitz estimation methods like LipSDP to larger CNNs by partitioning a big convolutional block into smaller blocks that can be solved in parallel. This enhances scalability while providing theoretical guarantees on the accuracy.
