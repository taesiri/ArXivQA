# [InFoBench: Evaluating Instruction Following Ability in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03601)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current methods for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to follow instructions have limitations, including lack of interpretability and scalability issues. 
- There is a need for reliable metrics and benchmarks focused specifically on systematically assessing LLMs' aptitude for understanding and executing instructions.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new metric called Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (DRFR) that breaks down complex instructions into multiple simpler binary questions to enable detailed analysis of whether LLMs meet specific criteria.
- Develop InfoBench, a diverse benchmark dataset with 500 instructions and 2,250 decomposed questions covering various constraint types to thoroughly test LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- DRFR provides more reliable and interpretable evaluation compared to overall scoring methods, especially for complex instructions. Experiments showed higher inter-annotator agreement with DRFR.
- Established efficacy of using GPT-4 for automatic evaluation. It emerges as cost-efficient and accurate when using a structured, multi-turn prompt.
- Comprehensive analysis of several advanced LLMs using the automated evaluation toolkit revealed strengths and weaknesses. Models still struggle with perfect instruction-following, particularly constraints involving numbers and linguistics. 
- The introduced metric, dataset and automatic toolkit enable detailed assessment of instruction-following skills and provide insights to guide future progress in developing more robust and versatile LLMs.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions to the methodology and tools for systematically evaluating and enhancing LLMs' capability to accurately understand and follow diverse instructions. The proposed techniques pave the way for the next generation of AI systems with more reliable real-world applicability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new metric called the Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (DRFR) and an accompanying benchmark dataset called InfoBench to evaluate the instruction-following abilities of large language models, finding that while models are making progress, there are still deficiencies in handling complex instructions involving numerical or linguistic constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a novel and scalable metric, the Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (\metricname), to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions. This metric breaks down complex instructions into multiple simpler criteria to allow for detailed and interpretable analysis of model performance.

2) It develops \datasetname, a comprehensive benchmark dataset with 500 diverse instructions and 2,250 decomposed questions to systematically test LLMs' instruction-following capabilities. The instructions cover a broad range of domains and constraint types.

3) Through experiments, the paper demonstrates the higher reliability of \metricname over traditional scoring methods and shows the potential of using GPT-4 as a cost-effective and accurate annotator, especially when employing a structured, multi-turn prompting approach.

4) The paper utilizes the proposed evaluation toolkit to comprehensively analyze six advanced LLMs. The findings reveal current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in instruction-following, showing that while progress has been significant, challenges remain particularly in complex scenarios.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel evaluation methodology and benchmark that provides detailed insights into LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in following instructions, paving the way for future improvements.
