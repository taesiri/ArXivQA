# [Multimodal Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model for Skeleton-based Video   Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07205)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop an effective video anomaly detection model that captures the inherent multimodality of both normal and abnormal events?

The key hypothesis seems to be: 

By leveraging diffusion models to generate diverse but plausible future motion sequences, conditioned on observed past motion, we can distinguish normal from anomalous events more accurately compared to prior reconstruction-based or score-based anomaly detection techniques.

Specifically, the paper proposes that normal and abnormal events are both intrinsically multimodal in nature - there are many ways a normal or abnormal event could unfold. However, prior techniques constrain normal events to a limited latent volume or rely on a single reconstruction, failing to capture the full diversity. 

In contrast, the proposed approach uses a conditional diffusion model to generate multiple plausible future motion sequences given an observed past sequence. By comparing the statistical properties of the generated futures to the true future, anomalies can be detected when the generations are not biased towards the ground truth like they are for normal events.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the multimodality of possible futures with a conditional diffusion model can improve anomaly detection performance compared to prior approaches. The experiments aim to validate this claim on several video anomaly detection benchmark datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new generative model for video anomaly detection (VAD) called MoCoDAD (Motion Conditioned Diffusion Anomaly Detection). 

2. It is the first work to apply denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for anomaly detection in videos. It leverages the improved mode coverage capabilities of DDPMs to generate diverse and multimodal future human poses when conditioned on normal motion, while generating distorted poses when conditioned on abnormal motion.

3. It introduces a novel motion-based conditioning strategy to guide the diffusion process using the clean past motion frames. This helps generate motion coherent with the observed conditioning frames for normal events.

4. It validates the model on multiple benchmark datasets including UBnormal, HR-UBnormal, HR-Avenue and HR-STC, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in anomaly detection.

5. The model works directly on human skeletal poses rather than raw video, providing benefits like privacy protection and computational efficiency.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of diffusion models to generate multimodal futures conditioned on past motion, and using the statistical aggregation of the generated futures to discern normal and anomalous events. The conditioning strategy and application to skeletal poses rather than raw video are also notable contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video anomaly detection method using multimodal motion conditioned diffusion models that generates and statistically aggregates diverse but plausible future pose motions when conditioned on normal past frames, while yielding less pertinent future motions when conditioned on abnormal past frames, allowing it to discern anomalies.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in video anomaly detection:

- The use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) is novel for video anomaly detection. DDPMs have shown great success recently in generative image modeling and synthesis, but have not been widely explored for video understanding tasks. Applying DDPMs for anomaly detection is an interesting idea that leverages their capabilities for modeling complex distributions. 

- Most prior video anomaly detection methods rely on reconstructing the input or predicting future frames as a proxy task. This paper argues that reconstruction-based methods often fail to capture the inherent multimodality of normal behaviors. The proposed diffusion-based approach aims to model the multimodal aspects of both normal and abnormal motions.

- Many recent skeleton-based anomaly detection methods constrain normal motions to a limited latent volume and detect anomalies as anything outside this volume. The authors argue this may not properly handle the diversity of normal motions. The proposed diffusion approach does not pre-define a constrained latent volume and can potentially model more variation.

- Most competitor methods considered are based on skeletal pose inputs rather than raw video. Using pose as input provides certain advantages like computational efficiency and avoiding irrelevant background clutter. The proposed method follows this trend of focusing on pose-based inputs.

- The paper provides extensive experiments on multiple standard pose-based anomaly detection benchmarks like UBnormal, STC, and Avenue. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior pose-based methods.

- The approach is evaluated without using any anomaly examples for training, following the standard one-class classification formulation for anomaly detection. This is a challenging setting that many methods aim to tackle.

Overall, the use of diffusion models and the goal of capturing multimodal motions seem to differentiate this work from prior art. The strong experimental results validate the proposed approach as an advancement for pose-based video anomaly detection. Further analysis on factors like model interpretabiliy and computational efficiency could provide additional useful comparisons.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different architectures and objective functions for the diffusion model. The authors use a particular U-Net architecture and reconstruction loss in this work, but suggest trying other network architectures and training objectives could further improve performance. 

- Applying the diffusion framework to other anomaly detection tasks beyond video, such as for time series data, medical images, etc. The authors propose their method is broadly applicable for anomaly detection in different domains.

- Combining the proposed diffusion approach with discriminative classifiers. The authors suggest the generative diffusion model could provide useful features to feed into discriminative classifiers for a hybrid approach.

- Exploring other conditioning strategies beyond encoding the past frames. The authors examine different ways to condition the diffusion but suggest there may be other useful conditioning signals to try.

- Applying more advanced sampling techniques during inference. The authors use a basic sampling strategy but note more complex MCMC-based sampling could improve results.

- Extending the framework to handle longer video sequences. The authors acknowledge their method currently works on short clips and suggest adapting it to model longer videos is an important direction.

- Incorporating multimodal data beyond just skeletal motions. The authors focus on skeletal poses but suggest incorporating RGB video or other modalities could be beneficial.

- Considering different diffusion model variations, like using latent spaces or cascade diffusion. The authors analyze some of these but suggest more exploration is needed.

In summary, the main future directions relate to improving the diffusion modeling approach itself, applying it to new tasks and data modalities, and integrating it with other techniques like discriminative classifiers or more advanced sampling methods. The authors position their work as an initial exploration of diffusion models for anomaly detection that could spur many new research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for video anomaly detection that leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). The key idea is to model both normal and abnormal events as being multimodal, i.e. having multiple modes of variation. The method splits a video sequence into past and future frames. The future frames are corrupted with noise using a forward diffusion process. Then a reverse diffusion process attempts to denoise the future frames by conditioning on the uncorrupted past frames. At test time, the model generates multiple possible futures by sampling, and compares them to the ground truth future frames. For normal events, the generated futures will be diverse but biased towards the true future. For abnormal events, the generated futures will be just as diverse, but not pertinent to the actual future. Experiments on multiple anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The approach does not use any appearance information, relying only on poses, providing privacy protection and efficiency. Overall, the paper introduces diffusion models to video anomaly detection, with a novel conditioning strategy, and shows strong results by modeling the multimodality of both normal and anomalous events.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel generative model for video anomaly detection called MoCoDAD (Motion Conditioned Diffusion Anomaly Detection). The key idea is to model both normal and anomalous motions as multimodal distributions and use a diffusion probabilistic model to generate diverse but plausible future motion sequences conditioned on observed past motions. 

The model is trained on only normal video clips in an unsupervised manner. At test time, it takes a sequence of poses as input, divides them into past (conditioning) and future (to predict), adds noise to the future, and tries to denoise the future poses conditioned on the past via a reverse diffusion process. For normal motions, the generated futures tend to cluster around the true future, while for anomalies they are more spread out. Anomaly scores are computed by aggregating reconstruction errors over multiple sampled plausible futures. Experiments on 3 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance compared to previous reconstruction-based and one-class classification techniques. A key advantage is explicitly modeling multimodality instead of assuming a unimodal latent representation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel generative model for video anomaly detection based on diffusion probabilistic models. Given a sequence of skeletal poses representing human motion, the sequence is split into a past segment and a future segment. The future segment is corrupted by adding noise to the joint coordinates. A diffusion model is trained to denoise the corrupted future poses by estimating this added noise, conditioned on the uncorrupted past poses. At inference time, the model generates multiple possible futures starting from random noise, conditioned on the observed past. These possible futures are compared to the actual future poses to detect anomalies - normal futures should lie close to the actual future, while abnormal futures will be further away. The anomaly score for a sequence is obtained by statistically aggregating the comparison with the generated futures, with the best results obtained using the minimum distance to the actual future.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is how to detect anomalous events in videos using a generative model. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel generative model called Motion Conditioned Diffusion Anomaly Detection (MoCoDAD) for video anomaly detection. Here are the key aspects of the problem and approach:

- Video anomaly detection is challenging due to the rarity and unpredictability of anomalies, as well as the complexity and diversity of normal events. Most prior work frames it as an open set recognition problem and learns only from normal data. 

- The paper argues that both normal and anomalous events exhibit multimodality - there are many ways a normal or abnormal event can unfold. Prior methods fail to model this diversity and often constrain normal events to a limited latent space.

- The proposed MoCoDAD model uses a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate diverse plausible futures conditioned on observed past motions. For normal events, the generated futures will be pertinent to the actual future. For anomalies, the generations will lack pertinence.

- MoCoDAD models the multimodality of both normal and anomalous events. It statistically aggregates multiple generated futures and detects anomalies when the aggregate pertinence of generations is low compared to the ground truth future.

- The method is evaluated on multiple video anomaly detection benchmarks focused on human motions. It outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the benefits of modeling multimodality and using a generative forecasting approach for anomaly detection.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage the capabilities of conditional diffusion models to generate multimodal futures that uncover anomalies when their aggregate statistics deviate from the actual future. The generative modeling of motion provides an effective approach for open set video anomaly detection.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Video anomaly detection (VAD) - The paper focuses on detecting anomalies or unusual events in videos. This is referred to as video anomaly detection.

- Skeletal motion - Rather than using raw video frames, the paper represents motions using skeletal poses extracted from the video. The model operates on these skeletal motions.

- Diffusion models - The proposed model is based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). These generative models can capture complex distributions and generate diverse samples.

- Multimodality - A key aspect is modeling both normal and abnormal events as multimodal distributions with multiple modes, rather than constraining them to a single mode.

- Conditioning - The model is conditioned on past (clean) motion frames to guide the generation/reconstruction of future frames. Different conditioning strategies are explored. 

- Forecasting - Future skeletal poses are predicted in a forecasting framework based on past context. This acts as a proxy task for anomaly detection.

- Open set detection - Anomaly detection is treated as an open set problem since anomalies are unpredictable and unconstrained.

- Aggregation - Multiple possible futures are generated and then aggregated statistically to obtain an anomaly score. 

- State-of-the-art performance - The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple standard anomaly detection benchmarks.

So in summary, the key focus is using diffusion models for open set anomaly detection on skeletal motions by modeling multimodality and conditioning on motion context. The model advances the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.
