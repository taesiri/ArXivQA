# [DIRECT: Deep Active Learning under Imbalance and Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09196)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new deep active learning algorithm called DIRECT to address class imbalance. The key idea is to reduce the problem to a one-dimensional active learning problem by sorting unlabeled examples by their uncertainty scores. This allows identifying the optimal separation threshold between minority and majority classes. The algorithm then actively queries the most uncertain examples from the minority classes near this threshold to collect a more balanced and informative labeled dataset. Compared to prior arts like GALAXY, DIRECT allows parallel annotation and is more robust to label noise. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate DIRECT saves over 15% more annotation cost than GALAXY and 90% cost than random sampling, all while allowing batch labeling. The reduction to 1D active learning allows leveraging classic literature, overcoming limitations of prior deep active learning methods. Overall, DIRECT provides an effective approach for deep active learning under class imbalance and label noise.
