# [DIRECT: Deep Active Learning under Imbalance and Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09196)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new deep active learning algorithm called DIRECT to address class imbalance. The key idea is to reduce the problem to a one-dimensional active learning problem by sorting unlabeled examples by their uncertainty scores. This allows identifying the optimal separation threshold between minority and majority classes. The algorithm then actively queries the most uncertain examples from the minority classes near this threshold to collect a more balanced and informative labeled dataset. Compared to prior arts like GALAXY, DIRECT allows parallel annotation and is more robust to label noise. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate DIRECT saves over 15% more annotation cost than GALAXY and 90% cost than random sampling, all while allowing batch labeling. The reduction to 1D active learning allows leveraging classic literature, overcoming limitations of prior deep active learning methods. Overall, DIRECT provides an effective approach for deep active learning under class imbalance and label noise.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Class imbalance is a common issue in machine learning, leading to poor performance on minority/rare classes. 
- Active learning is effective for tackling this by adaptively selecting informative and balanced examples to label.
- However, existing active learning methods perform poorly under imbalance and struggle with issues like label noise or inability to allow parallel annotation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new algorithm called DIRECT that reduces the problem to 1D active learning. 
- It first identifies the optimal class separation threshold by modeling it as a 1D active learning problem over sorted score margins.
- Then it annotates the most uncertain examples from minority classes near this threshold.  
- This reduction allows leveraging robust active learning methods to allow parallel annotation and handle label noise.

Key Contributions:
- Novel reduction to transform deep active learning under imbalance to 1D active learning.
- New algorithm DIRECT that identifies separation thresholds via 1D active learning and annotates balanced and uncertain examples.  
- Handles issues like label noise and enables parallel annotation compared to prior arts like GALAXY.
- Saves 15% more annotation cost than GALAXY and 90% cost than random sampling.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in deep active learning for tackling class imbalance via a smart reduction that bridges deep learning with classic active learning literature. The proposed DIRECT algorithm is more robust and cost-effective than prior arts.
