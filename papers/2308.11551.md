# [Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11551)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we improve video-text retrieval performance in the practical scenario where videos contain multiple events while text queries tend to refer to individual events? The key hypotheses are:1) Existing video-text retrieval models that assume a bijective mapping between videos and texts will degrade in performance when applied to the multi-event video setting.2) Representing videos as bags of key events and using a multi-event video-text loss function will better handle the mismatch between multi-event videos and single-event texts.In summary, the paper introduces a new multi-event video-text retrieval task to address a practical video search scenario. The main hypothesis is that explicitly modeling videos as containing multiple events and texts as referring to individual events will improve retrieval performance compared to models that assume a one-to-one video-text mapping. The proposed model and experiments aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:- Introducing a new task called Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval (MeVTR). This is a more realistic scenario for video-text retrieval where each video contains multiple events and each text describes a single event within the video. - Proposing a new model called Me-Retriever tailored for the MeVTR task. The key ideas are:    - Representing videos using selected key event features rather than the full video. This is done via a clustering-based key event selection module.    - Using a new MeVTR loss function during training that handles the multi-to-one mapping between videos and texts.- Conducting comprehensive experiments on two datasets to evaluate Me-Retriever and establish it as an effective baseline for the MeVTR task. The results show it outperforms previous video-text retrieval models designed for the standard one-to-one mapping setting.- Providing ablation studies to validate the design choices like using key event selection and the MeVTR loss. This demonstrates their effectiveness on the MeVTR task.In summary, the main contribution seems to be introducing and formalizing the MeVTR task, and proposing the Me-Retriever model as an effective baseline approach for this new video-text retrieval scenario involving multi-event videos. The experiments and analyses provide support for the effectiveness of this method.
