# [AQA-Bench: An Interactive Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Sequential   Reasoning Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) rely on one-off interactions like multiple choice questions, which fail to assess LLMs' ability for procedural adherence and active memory maintenance - key aspects of complex sequential reasoning. 

Solution: 
The paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel interactive question-answering benchmark to quantitatively assess LLMs' proficiency in executing predefined algorithms like binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search. 

The key feature is the interactive evaluation protocol - in depth-first search for example, the availability of each node's connected edges depends on whether the model has traversed to that node before, requiring the LLM to remember visited nodes and strategize moves.

Metrics:
AQA-Bench measures both (1) how close the model gets to the end goal, and (2) how efficiently it follows the intended algorithm policy. The former is prioritized when comparing models.

Findings:
(1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 significantly outperform open-source LLMs, revealing a gap in sequential reasoning abilities. 

(2) Providing interactive examples can sometimes hurt few-shot performance, suggesting more studies on how multi-round examples should be presented are needed.

(3) With just a few steps under the optimal policy, smaller models' performance improves substantially, sometimes even comparable to much larger models.

(4) In contrast to most LLM benchmarks, scaling laws correlating model performance and size do not always hold, sometimes even exhibiting inverse trends.

Main Contributions:
- AQA-Bench - a novel interactive benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs' algorithmic reasoning capability
- An empirical study across diverse models revealing limitations of current LLMs in sequential reasoning
- Analysis and findings that catalyze future work on advancing LLMs' sequential reasoning abilities


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark with interactive environments to assess large language models' ability in algorithmic reasoning and adherence to predefined procedures like binary search and graph traversal algorithms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search, binary search, and breadth-first search. The key feature of this evaluation benchmark is its interactive protocol, where the availability of information/data at each step depends on the model's previous actions. This requires the LLM to effectively remember previous states and strategize subsequent moves. The paper comprehensively evaluates the sequential reasoning abilities of 12 different LLMs using AQA-Bench.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called AQA-Bench to assess LLMs' ability in sequential reasoning. What are the key differences between AQA-Bench and existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' reasoning capabilities? What unique capabilities of LLMs does AQA-Bench aim to evaluate?

2. AQA-Bench uses an interactive evaluation protocol to assess models. Can you explain why this interaction-based approach is better suited for evaluating sequential reasoning compared to traditional one-off question formats? What are some challenges introduced due to this interaction-based design?

3. The paper builds AQA-Bench environments using 3 algorithms - binary search, DFS and BFS. Why were these specific algorithms chosen? What core sequential reasoning skills do they aim to evaluate in models? Could other algorithms have been used as well? Explain.  

4. Explain the two metrics - goal metric and policy metric - used to evaluate model performance in AQA-Bench. Why is the goal metric given higher priority than the policy metric? Provide a concrete example to illustrate.

5. The paper finds that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models on AQA-Bench environments. What factors might explain this performance gap? Does this highlight any limitations of current open-source LLMs?

6. An interesting finding is that model performance does not always correlate with size on AQA-Bench. What are some potential reasons behind why larger models sometimes underperform compared to smaller counterparts? 

7. The paper explores the impact of providing in-context examples. Explain the intriguing observation made regarding how this can sometimes negatively impact performance. Why might this occur?

8. Teacher-guiding is used to amend model outputs during intermediate interaction steps. Analyze the per-step ACC metric used to evaluate self-guiding ability. Why does PSACC decline in later stages for certain environments?

9. The AQA-Bench testbed currently only utilizes 3 algorithms. What are some ways the benchmark could be expanded to better assess a wider range of sequential reasoning skills? What other interactive environments could be incorporated?

10. The paper reveals limitations of current LLMs in algorithmic sequential reasoning. What are some research directions that should be explored to enhance model capabilities in this area?
