# [Linear Quadratic Guidance Law for Joint Motion Planning of a   Pursuer-Turret Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14997)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the joint motion planning of a pursuer vehicle equipped with a rotating turret/sensor platform trying to capture a maneuvering target. The goal is to steer the pursuer and orient the turret simultaneously to bring the target within the sensing range and field-of-view (FOV) of the turret at the time of interception. This is a more realistic constraint compared to requiring an exact collision course or precise orientation. 

The mathematical models capturing the engagement kinematics and the dynamics of the pursuer and turret are presented. The controls are the lateral acceleration command for the pursuer and the torque applied to orient the turret. The paper aims to obtain an optimal guidance law that minimizes the control effort while satisfying the terminal miss distance and FOV constraints.

Proposed Solution:
The non-linear engagement kinematics are first linearized about the initial collision triangle under the assumption of small lead angles. This transforms the problem into regulating certain predicted states to be within desired bounds. An analytical optimal guidance law minimizing a convex combination of the control efforts is then derived using calculus of variations and quadratic optimization. 

The guidance law obtains the optimal predicted miss distance and turret orientation error to be achieved at the time of interception. It features a variable weighting parameter that allows tuning the cooperation between the maneuvers of the pursuer and the turret based on their relative abilities. Closed-form expressions are provided for the ideal dynamics case. The guidance law utilizes only the readily available states in its implementation.

Simulations: 
Detailed numerical simulations are presented showcasing successful interception for various engagement scenarios and target trajectories. The results demonstrate the pursuer and turret steering cooperatively to satisfy the terminal constraints. They also verify that the guidance law is effective even when the linearization assumptions are moderately violated.

In summary, the key contributions are: (i) a convex optimal control problem formulation for joint motion planning of a pursuer-turret system with practical termination constraints, (ii) an implementable analytical guidance law solution for this problem, and (iii) numerical validation of the approach.
