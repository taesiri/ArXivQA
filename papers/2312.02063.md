# [The GPU Phase Folding and Deep Learning Method for Detecting Exoplanet   Transits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02063)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel exoplanet detection method called GPFC that combines a fast GPU-based phase folding algorithm with a convolutional neural network (CNN). GPFC aims to identify small, ultra-short period exoplanets in Kepler light curves that may have been missed by traditional techniques like the Box-fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm. The GPU parallelized phase folding rapidly scans 100,000 trial periods to amplify potential transit signals. The CNN then discerns whether a transit exists in the folded light curves. Simulations demonstrate GPFC achieves higher accuracy than BLS for SNR<10 and processes light curves 15 times faster. When applied to real Kepler data, GPFC successfully recovered all 43 confirmed ultra-short period exoplanets blindly with high probability scores. This highlights GPFC's potential for uncovering new small exoplanets undetected in previous Kepler analyses. By leveraging deep learning and GPU optimized computations, GPFC pushes the boundaries of transit detection efficiency. The method can be extended to search various period ranges across diverse transit surveys.
