# [Video is All You Need: Attacking PPG-based Biometric Authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00928)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals extracted from video clips be used to spoof photoplethysmography (PPG)-based biometric authentication systems? The authors pose this question because PPG signals collected from wearable devices are increasingly being used for biometric authentication, under the assumption that they are difficult for remote adversaries to obtain. However, recent advances in rPPG allow an adversary to extract PPG signals from videos of a person's face. The authors investigate whether these rPPG signals can be used to spoof PPG-based biometric systems.To address this question, the authors:1) Propose a new method (called SigR) to restore rPPG signals extracted from videos to match the victim's real PPG signals.2) Evaluate the effectiveness of using the restored rPPG signals to spoof a state-of-the-art PPG-based biometric authentication system.3) Analyze the impact of different video quality factors (frame rate, resolution, etc) on the success rate of the spoofing attack.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that rPPG signals from video can be restored and used to spoof PPG-based biometric authentication, which the authors evaluate through both signal analysis and spoofing attack experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel spoofing attack on PPG-based biometric authentication using only video clips of the victim's face. This is the first attack that uses video to spoof PPG-based authentication without requiring any leaked PPG signals from the victim. 2. It develops a new PPG signal restoration model called SigR to accurately restore rPPG signals extracted from videos to PPG signals. SigR uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to learn the mapping from rPPG to PPG.3. It evaluates the effectiveness of the attack using the UBFC-PHYS dataset with videos of subjects in different states (resting, talking, calculating). The attack achieves high false acceptance rates, with the best attack success rate of 0.62 using SigR.4. It analyzes the impact of various video quality factors like frame rate, resolution, bit rate, and beauty filter on the attack success rate. The results show rPPG signals can still pose a threat even with degraded video quality.In summary, this paper demonstrates the vulnerability of PPG-based authentication to spoofing attacks using just video data, made possible by the new rPPG restoration model SigR. It highlights the need for defensive strategies to protect against such video-based spoofing attacks on PPG authentication systems.
