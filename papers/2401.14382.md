## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) are mathematical models that combine differential equations describing system dynamics with algebraic equations constraining the solution space. DAEs have widespread applications but are challenging to solve, especially systems involving fractional derivatives. This paper aims to develop an effective methodology for solving various types of DAEs.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach by establishing connections between the least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) model, weighted residual methods, and Legendre orthogonal polynomials. 

The key ideas are:

1) Represent the DAE solution as a linear combination of Legendre polynomials with unknown coefficients. Use LS-SVR to find these coefficients.

2) Formulate the residual equation based on weighted residual methods and take its inner product with the Dirac delta function based on collocation principles. 

3) Construct a quadratic programming problem with constraints defined by the residuals to find the Legendre coefficients.

4) Employ the resultant Legendre series solution to approximate the DAE solution with exponential convergence.

The method termed Collocation LS-SVR (CLS-SVR) is applied to solve different DAEs:

- Linear and nonlinear DAEs
- Volterra integro-differential algebraic equations of fractional order  
- Partial differential algebraic equations

Main Contributions:

- Merging collocation methods with LS-SVR for solving DAEs
- Using Legendre polynomials as kernels in LS-SVR
- Applying LS-SVR to fractional order DAEs
- Demonstrating CLS-SVR on linear, nonlinear, integro-differential, partial and fractional DAEs

The proposed technique achieves high accuracy in solving the test DAEs showcasing its reliability and effectiveness. It presents several advantages over conventional numerical methods including well-conditioning, exponential convergence and symmetric positive definiteness.

In summary, the paper makes noteworthy contributions in utilizing machine learning concepts to efficiently solve the challenging problem of DAE resolution across different application contexts.
