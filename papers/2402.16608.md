# [PAQA: Toward ProActive Open-Retrieval Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper addresses the lack of proactive participation of conversational systems in clarifying ambiguous queries during information-seeking conversations. Due to inherent ambiguities in natural language, these systems fail to capture the true intent behind queries, especially when the retrieved documents contain multiple plausible interpretations. To enable systems to clarify ambiguities, the paper proposes the task of proactive question answering which involves directly answering non-ambiguous questions and asking clarifying questions for ambiguous ones. 

However, current datasets lack adequate supervision for training systems on this task. To address this gap, the paper introduces PAQA - an extension of the AmbiNQ dataset with additional clarifying questions for ambiguous queries. The questions are generated using GPT-3 given sample disambiguated questions. Along with questions, answers and documents, PAQA contains over 11k examples annotated for ambiguity.

The paper also provides baseline methods involving a seq2seq model to generate answers or clarifying questions based on the question and optionally retrieved documents and extracted answers. Experiments demonstrate that retrieval quality significantly impacts performance. The human evaluation also shows that the synthetic clarifying questions are mostly natural and cover ambiguities effectively.

In conclusion, PAQA facilitates improved training and evaluation of ambiguity detection and clarification abilities of systems. By enhancing proactive clarification, the work aims to enable conversational systems to engage better with users for more accurate information-seeking.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PAQA, a new dataset extending AmbigNQ with clarifying questions resolving query ambiguities, along with reference models for detecting ambiguity and generating clarifying questions in open-retrieval question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing the PAQA dataset, which extends the existing AmbigNQ dataset by providing additional clarifying questions. Specifically, the PAQA dataset contains ambiguous questions annotated with:

- Sets of possible answers grounded in retrieved passages
- Clarifying questions that aim to resolve the ambiguity 
- Supporting documents containing the answers

The goal of the PAQA dataset is to provide supervision to train and evaluate conversational search systems on their ability to recognize ambiguities in questions and documents, and generate relevant clarifying questions. This aims to enhance the proactive participation of such systems in the information-seeking process.

The paper also provides baseline models for the tasks of ambiguity detection and clarifying question generation using the PAQA dataset. Experiments suggest that retrieval quality highly impacts the performance on these tasks. By releasing the PAQA dataset, the authors aim to advance research on conversational search systems and their ability to clarify ambiguous user queries.

The paper proposes an extension to the AmbigNQ dataset called PAQA which contains additional clarifying questions. It aims to better train and evaluate conversational systems on their ability to detect ambiguity in questions and proactively ask clarifying questions. The paper also provides baseline methods and results using generative models for this proactive question answering task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes extending the AmbigNQ dataset with clarifying questions. What was the motivation behind choosing AmbigNQ as the starting point rather than creating a new dataset from scratch? What are the advantages and limitations of building on AmbigNQ?

2. The clarifying questions were generated using GPT-3 few-shot learning. What other techniques were considered for generating clarifying questions? Why was GPT-3 chosen and what are its strengths and weaknesses for this task? 

3. The paper evaluates both the naturalness and relevance of the generated clarifying questions through human evaluation. What other metrics could be used to automatically evaluate the quality of clarifying questions? What are the challenges in automatically evaluating clarifying questions?

4. The reference models rely on a sequence-to-sequence architecture to tackle both answer generation and clarifying question generation. What are other possible model architectures that could be effective for this task? What are the tradeoffs in combining these two tasks versus separating them?

5. Retrieval quality seems to be a major bottleneck affecting the reference models' performance. What techniques could be explored to improve passage retrieval for this task? How important is domain-specific retrieval versus open-domain retrieval?

6. The reference models do not show significant gains from incorporating extracted answers. Why might this be the case? What enhancements could be made to the answer extraction component or to how extracted answers are integrated?

7. Beyond accuracy metrics, what other metrics should be used to evaluate system performance on the proactive question answering task? How can conversations with real users expose strengths/weaknesses not captured by offline metrics?

8. The paper focuses on generating a single clarifying question. How should the framework be extended to support multi-turn conversations with clarification sub-dialogs? What new challenges emerge in that setting?

9. What types of ambiguities is the current framework effective at resolving and where are there still gaps? How can the dataset evolve to cover more ambiguity phenomena? 

10. What ethical concerns need to be considered if using PAQA and similar datasets to train commercial conversational systems? Who might be negatively impacted and how can harms be mitigated?
