# [PAQA: Toward ProActive Open-Retrieval Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper addresses the lack of proactive participation of conversational systems in clarifying ambiguous queries during information-seeking conversations. Due to inherent ambiguities in natural language, these systems fail to capture the true intent behind queries, especially when the retrieved documents contain multiple plausible interpretations. To enable systems to clarify ambiguities, the paper proposes the task of proactive question answering which involves directly answering non-ambiguous questions and asking clarifying questions for ambiguous ones. 

However, current datasets lack adequate supervision for training systems on this task. To address this gap, the paper introduces PAQA - an extension of the AmbiNQ dataset with additional clarifying questions for ambiguous queries. The questions are generated using GPT-3 given sample disambiguated questions. Along with questions, answers and documents, PAQA contains over 11k examples annotated for ambiguity.

The paper also provides baseline methods involving a seq2seq model to generate answers or clarifying questions based on the question and optionally retrieved documents and extracted answers. Experiments demonstrate that retrieval quality significantly impacts performance. The human evaluation also shows that the synthetic clarifying questions are mostly natural and cover ambiguities effectively.

In conclusion, PAQA facilitates improved training and evaluation of ambiguity detection and clarification abilities of systems. By enhancing proactive clarification, the work aims to enable conversational systems to engage better with users for more accurate information-seeking.
