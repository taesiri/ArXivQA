# [CHATATC: Large Language Model-Driven Conversational Agents for   Supporting Strategic Air Traffic Flow Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14850)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traffic managers face complex decisions managing air traffic flow and responding to capacity constraints. This requires specialized training and experience.
- For common recurring situations like wind impacting the New York area, traffic managers must recreate solutions rather than leverage historical data. This is time consuming and inefficient. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a large language model (LLM) called ChatATC that can summarize historical Ground Delay Program (GDP) data. 
- ChatATC is trained on a dataset of over 80,000 historical GDP issuances spanning 2000-2023.
- Allow traffic managers to query ChatATC to get summaries of past GDPs, enabling them to leverage historical data more easily.

Key Contributions:
- Collection and analysis of a large dataset of historical GDP issuances over 20+ years
- Development of ChatATC, an LLM fine-tuned on GDP data to provide summarizations 
- Testing of ChatATC capabilities on sample GDP queries, showcasing correct and incorrect responses
- Design of a graphical user interface for traffic managers to interact with ChatATC

Limitations and Future Work:
- ChatATC is not suitable for safety-critical roles due to risks like hallucinations or lack of verifiability
- Additional testing needed with more traffic managers to improve capabilities
- Combine with quantitative similar day algorithms to identify historic days and automatically generate labels

In summary, the paper introduces ChatATC as an AI assistant to help traffic managers leverage historical data more efficiently by providing textual summarizations of past traffic flow programs. While promising for productivity, care must be taken regarding trust and safety considerations.
