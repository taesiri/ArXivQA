# Towards Automatic Concept-based Explanations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a systematic framework to automatically identify higher-level concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent, and important for a machine learning model's predictions?  The authors propose developing a concept-based explanation method that can automatically discover meaningful concepts from data, without requiring humans to provide labeled examples of concepts. This allows the method to identify concepts that may be unintuitive or overlooked by humans.The key ideas and contributions seem to be:- Laying out desiderata/principles for concept-based explanations: meaningfulness, coherence, importance.- Proposing a new algorithm called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) that aggregates related image segments across data to discover concepts.- Applying ACE to identify visual concepts that are semantically meaningful, perceptually coherent, and important for an image classifier's predictions.- Conducting experiments that validate ACE satisfies the principles and provides insights into the machine learning model.So in summary, the main research question is how to automatically extract human-understandable concepts that explain a model's predictions, which ACE aims to address. The concepts should be meaningful, coherent, and important according to the stated desiderata.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) to automatically identify high-level concepts that are important for a machine learning model's predictions, without requiring humans to provide labeled examples of concepts. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Laying out general principles and desiderata that a concept-based explanation method should satisfy, including meaningfulness, coherency, and importance of the concepts.- Developing the ACE algorithm that aggregates related image segments across data to discover concepts. It uses CNN activations as a similarity metric and clustering to find coherent concepts. - Applying ACE to ImageNet classification models and validating through quantitative experiments and human evaluations that the discovered concepts are human-interpretable, coherent, and important for the model's predictions.- Demonstrating how ACE can provide insights into what concepts the model relies on, including revealing unintuitive correlations learned by the model.So in summary, the main novelty is developing an automated approach to extract meaningful and important concepts from data to explain machine learning models, without needing humans to provide labeled concept examples. The paper shows this approach can work well and provide model insights.
