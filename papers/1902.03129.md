# Towards Automatic Concept-based Explanations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a systematic framework to automatically identify higher-level concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent, and important for a machine learning model's predictions?  The authors propose developing a concept-based explanation method that can automatically discover meaningful concepts from data, without requiring humans to provide labeled examples of concepts. This allows the method to identify concepts that may be unintuitive or overlooked by humans.The key ideas and contributions seem to be:- Laying out desiderata/principles for concept-based explanations: meaningfulness, coherence, importance.- Proposing a new algorithm called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) that aggregates related image segments across data to discover concepts.- Applying ACE to identify visual concepts that are semantically meaningful, perceptually coherent, and important for an image classifier's predictions.- Conducting experiments that validate ACE satisfies the principles and provides insights into the machine learning model.So in summary, the main research question is how to automatically extract human-understandable concepts that explain a model's predictions, which ACE aims to address. The concepts should be meaningful, coherent, and important according to the stated desiderata.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) to automatically identify high-level concepts that are important for a machine learning model's predictions, without requiring humans to provide labeled examples of concepts. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Laying out general principles and desiderata that a concept-based explanation method should satisfy, including meaningfulness, coherency, and importance of the concepts.- Developing the ACE algorithm that aggregates related image segments across data to discover concepts. It uses CNN activations as a similarity metric and clustering to find coherent concepts. - Applying ACE to ImageNet classification models and validating through quantitative experiments and human evaluations that the discovered concepts are human-interpretable, coherent, and important for the model's predictions.- Demonstrating how ACE can provide insights into what concepts the model relies on, including revealing unintuitive correlations learned by the model.So in summary, the main novelty is developing an automated approach to extract meaningful and important concepts from data to explain machine learning models, without needing humans to provide labeled concept examples. The paper shows this approach can work well and provide model insights.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new algorithm called ACE to automatically extract visual concepts from images to explain image classification models, and demonstrates through experiments that ACE discovers concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent, and important for the model's predictions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of interpretability and explainability of machine learning models:- The paper focuses on developing concept-based explanations, which aim to identify higher-level concepts that are human-understandable and apply across the dataset, rather than just providing feature importance scores for individual samples. This aligns with recent work like TCAV and IBD that also aim to produce concept-based explanations. - However, a key difference is that this paper proposes an automated approach to discover important concepts without requiring humans to provide example labels for each concept. Previous concept-based methods like TCAV and IBD rely on humans to label example data for the concepts they want to test. Removing this requirement for labeled concept examples increases the discovery power and makes it more scalable.- The proposed ACE algorithm takes a unique approach of using multi-resolution image segmentation and clustering in activation spaces of CNNs to automatically extract concept examples from the data itself. The idea of using segmentation and clustering to discover concepts is novel.- The paper provides a good set of principles and desiderata for concept-based explanations, including meaningfulness, coherency, and importance. These help guide evaluation of the method.- The experiments demonstrate that ACE can extract concepts satisfying the desiderata without human guidance. The human evaluation experiments help validate the meaningfulness and coherency. Importance is also evaluated empirically.- An interesting aspect is analyzing the model by "stitching" together the important concepts. The finding that this can often lead to correct classification aligns with similar observations about texture/style bias in CNNs.Overall, I find that this paper makes a nice contribution to the growing literature on interpretability and explainability. The idea of automated concept discovery is powerful and the proposed approach appears promising based on the initial experiments. The comparisons to humans provide evidence that ACE can produce explanations that are more intuitive and understandable.
