# [Towards Automatic Concept-based Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03129)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a systematic framework to automatically identify higher-level concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent, and important for a machine learning model's predictions?  

The authors propose developing a concept-based explanation method that can automatically discover meaningful concepts from data, without requiring humans to provide labeled examples of concepts. This allows the method to identify concepts that may be unintuitive or overlooked by humans.

The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Laying out desiderata/principles for concept-based explanations: meaningfulness, coherence, importance.

- Proposing a new algorithm called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) that aggregates related image segments across data to discover concepts.

- Applying ACE to identify visual concepts that are semantically meaningful, perceptually coherent, and important for an image classifier's predictions.

- Conducting experiments that validate ACE satisfies the principles and provides insights into the machine learning model.

So in summary, the main research question is how to automatically extract human-understandable concepts that explain a model's predictions, which ACE aims to address. The concepts should be meaningful, coherent, and important according to the stated desiderata.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) to automatically identify high-level concepts that are important for a machine learning model's predictions, without requiring humans to provide labeled examples of concepts. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Laying out general principles and desiderata that a concept-based explanation method should satisfy, including meaningfulness, coherency, and importance of the concepts.

- Developing the ACE algorithm that aggregates related image segments across data to discover concepts. It uses CNN activations as a similarity metric and clustering to find coherent concepts. 

- Applying ACE to ImageNet classification models and validating through quantitative experiments and human evaluations that the discovered concepts are human-interpretable, coherent, and important for the model's predictions.

- Demonstrating how ACE can provide insights into what concepts the model relies on, including revealing unintuitive correlations learned by the model.

So in summary, the main novelty is developing an automated approach to extract meaningful and important concepts from data to explain machine learning models, without needing humans to provide labeled concept examples. The paper shows this approach can work well and provide model insights.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new algorithm called ACE to automatically extract visual concepts from images to explain image classification models, and demonstrates through experiments that ACE discovers concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent, and important for the model's predictions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of interpretability and explainability of machine learning models:

- The paper focuses on developing concept-based explanations, which aim to identify higher-level concepts that are human-understandable and apply across the dataset, rather than just providing feature importance scores for individual samples. This aligns with recent work like TCAV and IBD that also aim to produce concept-based explanations. 

- However, a key difference is that this paper proposes an automated approach to discover important concepts without requiring humans to provide example labels for each concept. Previous concept-based methods like TCAV and IBD rely on humans to label example data for the concepts they want to test. Removing this requirement for labeled concept examples increases the discovery power and makes it more scalable.

- The proposed ACE algorithm takes a unique approach of using multi-resolution image segmentation and clustering in activation spaces of CNNs to automatically extract concept examples from the data itself. The idea of using segmentation and clustering to discover concepts is novel.

- The paper provides a good set of principles and desiderata for concept-based explanations, including meaningfulness, coherency, and importance. These help guide evaluation of the method.

- The experiments demonstrate that ACE can extract concepts satisfying the desiderata without human guidance. The human evaluation experiments help validate the meaningfulness and coherency. Importance is also evaluated empirically.

- An interesting aspect is analyzing the model by "stitching" together the important concepts. The finding that this can often lead to correct classification aligns with similar observations about texture/style bias in CNNs.

Overall, I find that this paper makes a nice contribution to the growing literature on interpretability and explainability. The idea of automated concept discovery is powerful and the proposed approach appears promising based on the initial experiments. The comparisons to humans provide evidence that ACE can produce explanations that are more intuitive and understandable.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Apply the method to other data modalities beyond images, such as text, audio, etc. The authors note that automatically grouping features into meaningful concepts is more straightforward for images compared to other data types.

- Tune the algorithm's hyperparameters (e.g. multi-resolution segmentation parameters) separately for each class to better capture inherent granularity. For example, natural scene classes may have fewer concepts compared to city scenes. 

- Further combine seemingly duplicated concepts discovered by the algorithm. For example, several similar ocean surface concepts were found that may potentially be merged into one overall "ocean" concept.

- Address limitations around occasionally discovering incoherent concepts due to segmentation errors, clustering errors, or issues with the similarity metric. The authors note this was rare but did sometimes occur.

- Evaluate the approach on more complex and abstract concepts that are difficult to automatically extract compared to coherent visual concepts.

- Develop methods to provide local instance-level explanations in addition to the global class-level explanations.

- Explore modifications to the algorithm's concept discovery process to improve meaningfulness and coherence.

- Evaluate the approach on a wider range of state-of-the-art neural network architectures and datasets beyond Inception-V3 on ImageNet.

In summary, the main directions are applying the method to new data types and tasks, improving concept quality, and providing more granular explanations. The authors lay good groundwork for automatically discovering human-interpretable concepts from data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes principles and desiderata for concept-based explanations of machine learning models, which identify higher-level human-understandable concepts rather than just per-sample feature importance scores. The authors develop a new algorithm called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) to automatically extract visual concepts from image data by aggregating related image segments across the dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ACE discovers concepts that are coherent, meaningful to humans, and important for the model's predictions.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes principles and desiderata for concept-based explanations of machine learning models. Most current explanation methods provide feature importance scores to explain individual predictions. However, summarizing these per-sample explanations is challenging. The authors argue for concept-based explanations that identify higher-level, human-understandable concepts that apply across the dataset. They lay out principles that concept-based explanations should satisfy: meaningfulness (examples are semantically coherent), coherency (examples are perceptually similar), and importance (concepts are predictive of the target class). 

The authors develop a new algorithm, ACE, to automatically discover visual concepts from images. ACE segments images into regions at multiple resolutions to capture concepts at different scales. It clusters perceptually similar segments in a CNN feature space as concept examples, filtering out incoherent outliers. ACE scores concepts using TCAV, a measure of how predictive a concept is for a class. Experiments on ImageNet classification models show ACE identifies human-interpretable, coherent concepts that are important for the model's predictions. The discovered concepts provide insights into the model, like unintuitive correlations it has learned.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new algorithm called ACE (Automated Concept-based Explanation) to automatically identify higher-level concepts that are important for a neural network's predictions. The key idea is to aggregate related image segments across diverse data to find coherent concepts. The method takes a trained classifier and a set of images as input. It segments the images at multiple resolutions to capture concepts at different levels of abstraction. It then maps the segments through the classifier to get an activation representation that is used as a similarity space. Similar segments are clustered as examples of concepts and outliers are removed to increase coherence. Finally, the method computes a concept importance score using TCAV to identify the most important concepts for the network's predictions on that class of images. The multi-resolution segmentation and automated clustering allow ACE to discover meaningful, coherent concepts without requiring human labeling. Experiments demonstrate the identified concepts are human-interpretable and provide insights into the model.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points from my reading of the paper are:

- The paper is addressing the problem of making machine learning model explanations more human-understandable and meaningful. 

- Most current ML explanation methods provide feature importance scores, which identify important features/pixels for each input. But summarizing these individual feature importances into higher-level concepts is challenging.

- The paper proposes principles and desiderata for "concept-based" explanations, which identify higher level human-understandable concepts that apply across the dataset, instead of just features for each input.

- They develop a new algorithm called ACE to automatically extract visual concepts from images to explain an image classifier. 

- ACE works by aggregating related image segments across the data to find coherent concepts. It uses a CNN bottleneck layer as a perceptual similarity metric to cluster segments into concepts.

- Experiments show ACE discovers concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent, and important for the neural network's predictions according to both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

In summary, the key focus is developing an automated way to generate concept-based explanations of ML models that are more intuitive for humans to understand, compared to individual feature importances. The ACE algorithm is proposed as a way to do this for image classifiers.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Automated Concept-based Explanation (ACE) to automatically identify high-level human-understandable concepts that are meaningful, coherent, and important for explaining a neural network's predictions. ACE takes a trained image classifier and set of images from a class, segments the images at multiple resolutions, clusters similar segments in the activation space of the network to find coherent concepts, and calculates each concept's importance using TCAV scores. Experiments on ImageNet classifiers show ACE can find concepts like textures, object parts, and full objects. Human experiments validate the meaningfulness and coherence of discovered concepts. ACE provides insights into surprising correlations learned by models, like basketball jerseys being more important than the ball for recognizing basketball images. A key advantage of ACE is it automatically discovers salient concepts without needing humans to provide labeled examples to query like prior methods. The paper argues ACE satisfies key desiderata for concept-based explanations: meaningfulness, coherence, and importance. It demonstrates the ability to gain insights into models by surfacing the higher-level concepts automatically learned by neural networks.
