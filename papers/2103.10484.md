# [Concentric Spherical GNN for 3D Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1. Can learning over concentric spherical feature maps, as opposed to a single sphere, lead to more expressive and generalizable representations for 3D data? The authors argue that projecting 3D data onto a single sphere, as done in previous spherical CNN works, may result in loss of information and be insufficiently expressive. They propose using multiple concentric spheres instead, to more natively capture 3D distributions.2. Can convolutional architectures be designed to incorporate information both within and between concentric spheres in a rotationally equivariant manner?The authors propose combining intra-sphere graph convolutions with inter-sphere radial convolutions to incrementally aggregate information over the concentric spheres representation. They argue this allows retaining rotational equivariance properties of spherical CNNs.3. Can the proposed concentric spherical architecture and convolutions improve performance on 3D classification tasks, especially when training and testing on arbitrarily rotated data?The authors demonstrate improved classification accuracy on ModelNet40 point clouds and SHREC17 meshes compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the challenging setting of arbitrary rotations. This provides evidence for the benefits of the proposed architecture.In summary, the main hypotheses are around the advantages of using concentric spheres over a single sphere for representing 3D data, designing convolutions over this representation, and showing these translate to empirical gains in tasks involving arbitrarily oriented 3D data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a new multi-resolution convolutional neural network architecture for learning on concentric spherical feature maps. The key contributions are:- Proposing a concentric spherical discretization of 3D space using multiple spheres at different radii. This is more flexible than using a single sphere discretization as in previous spherical CNN works.- Introducing two new convolution operations - graph convolutions for incorporating intra-sphere information and radial convolutions for incorporating inter-sphere information. The combination allows capturing 3D relationships while retaining rotational equivariance. - Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on 3D classification tasks with two different input types - mesh objects and point clouds. For point clouds, they propose an efficient mapping based on radial basis functions to map unstructured points to the concentric spherical grids.- Overall, showing that incorporating the radial dimension through concentric spheres and new convolution operations leads to more expressive and robust learned representations compared to single sphere CNNs. The multi-sphere architecture with specialized convolutions is the main conceptual contribution.In summary, the key innovation is a new multi-resolution convolutional architecture over concentric spheres that achieves state-of-the-art 3D classification results. The new convolutions and discretization allow learning more expressive 3D representations in a rotationally equivariant manner.
