# [PointConvFormer: Revenge of the Point-based Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02879)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a novel building block called PointConvFormer for deep neural networks that process 3D point clouds. The central hypothesis is that using attention computed from feature differences to modify convolutional weights in local neighborhoods can help select more relevant points and improve generalization of point convolutional networks. 

The key research questions addressed are:

1) Can attention computed from feature differences help select better local neighborhoods and improve generalization for point convolutions? 

2) Does combining ideas from point convolution and transformers lead to better performance on point cloud tasks compared to using either one alone?

3) Can PointConvFormer provide a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to sparse convolutional approaches for point cloud tasks requiring point-level details like segmentation and scene flow?

The paper validates the PointConvFormer design through extensive experiments on semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation tasks using multiple datasets. The results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over regular convolutions, transformers and sparse convolution approaches, supporting the core hypothesis.
