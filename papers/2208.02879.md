# [PointConvFormer: Revenge of the Point-based Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02879)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a novel building block called PointConvFormer for deep neural networks that process 3D point clouds. The central hypothesis is that using attention computed from feature differences to modify convolutional weights in local neighborhoods can help select more relevant points and improve generalization of point convolutional networks. 

The key research questions addressed are:

1) Can attention computed from feature differences help select better local neighborhoods and improve generalization for point convolutions? 

2) Does combining ideas from point convolution and transformers lead to better performance on point cloud tasks compared to using either one alone?

3) Can PointConvFormer provide a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to sparse convolutional approaches for point cloud tasks requiring point-level details like segmentation and scene flow?

The paper validates the PointConvFormer design through extensive experiments on semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation tasks using multiple datasets. The results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over regular convolutions, transformers and sparse convolution approaches, supporting the core hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a novel building block called PointConvFormer for deep neural networks that process 3D point clouds. PointConvFormer combines ideas from point convolution and Transformers to improve the generalization capability and robustness of point-based models. Specifically:

- It introduces an attention mechanism computed from feature differences to reweight points in a local neighborhood for convolution. This allows selecting only relevant points and filtering out noise/outliers. 

- It preserves the invariances from point convolution by keeping the positional encoding outside of the attention module. This helps with out-of-sample generalization.

- It combines both positive and negative contributions from neighbors through convolution instead of the non-negative softmax attention used in Transformers.

- It is more lightweight than voxel-based approaches and previous point cloud Transformers.

The paper shows through experiments on semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation tasks that PointConvFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency tradeoffs compared to previous point-based and voxel-based methods. It demonstrates the potential of PointConvFormer as a powerful building block for point cloud processing tasks requiring point-level details.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel point cloud block that adaptively aggregates local neighborhoods using both position and feature information, outperforming regular convolution and Transformers, while preserving the benefits of both.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading, this paper makes several notable contributions when compared to other research on point cloud processing:

1. It proposes PointConvFormer, a new building block for point cloud networks that combines ideas from point convolutions and transformers. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like PointNet, PointConv, voxel-based methods, etc. that focused more purely on one paradigm or the other. 

2. PointConvFormer shows strong performance on semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation tasks. The results in Tables 1-3 demonstrate state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy compared to other point-based and voxel-based methods on the ScanNet, SemanticKITTI, FlyingThings3D, and KITTI datasets. 

3. The ablation studies provide insights into design choices like attention types, number of heads, etc. This helps advance understanding of what works well for point cloud processing beyond standard convolutions or transformers.

4. The visualizations in Figures 1 and 4 show qualitatively how PointConvFormer is able to combine the strengths of convolution and attention. It behaves similarly to convolution in flat areas but shows a stronger neighborhood selection effect near object boundaries.

5. The paper shows point-based methods can compete with or surpass sparse convolutional approaches on dense prediction tasks. This helps make the case that point-based models warrant more exploration as an efficient alternative to voxel-based networks.

Overall, by demonstrating a new building block, strong results across multiple datasets, design insights, qualitative analysis, and potential as an alternative to sparse convolutions, this paper makes several valuable additions compared to prior work on point cloud processing and 3D deep learning. The introduction of PointConvFormer and analysis around it helps advance the state of this research area.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other invariant coordinate transforms that could be concatenated with the relative position vector as input to the PointConvFormer layer. The paper tried a few handcrafted invariant coordinates, but learning these directly or exploring other possibilities could further improve robustness. 

- Applying PointConvFormer to additional tasks beyond semantic segmentation and scene flow, such as object detection, instance segmentation, etc. The paper shows promising results on dense prediction tasks, but PointConvFormer may also be suitable for other applications.

- Extending PointConvFormer to process larger-scale point clouds, such as from LiDAR scans of entire city blocks. The current experiments are on mostly indoor scenes or smaller outdoor segments. Scaling up to massive point clouds with hundreds of thousands of points could reveal new challenges.

- Improving the theoretical understanding of why PointConvFormer generalizes better than regular convolution on point clouds through further analysis and bounds based on the feature difference attention mechanism.

- Exploring variants of PointConvFormer, such as using different attention mechanisms or aggregators besides convolution. There is room to experiment with the overall formulation.

- Applying PointConvFormer layers in conjunction with other architectures such as graph neural networks to combine benefits of different approaches for processing point clouds.

So in summary, the authors propose further exploring the use of PointConvFormer layers across diverse tasks and model architectures, theoretically analyzing its properties, and scaling it to larger point cloud data as interesting future work after this initial paper introducing the concept.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces PointConvFormer, a novel building block for deep neural network architectures operating on 3D point clouds. PointConvFormer combines ideas from point convolution and Transformers. In point convolution, filter weights depend only on relative position, providing invariance. Transformers utilize feature-based attention to weight points. PointConvFormer uses attention based on feature differences between points to modify the convolutional weights at each point. This provides invariances from convolution while using attention to selectively weight relevant points. 

PointConvFormer is evaluated on semantic segmentation of indoor (ScanNet) and outdoor (SemanticKITTI) scenes, and scene flow estimation (FlyingThings3D, KITTI). It consistently outperforms classic convolutions, regular Transformers, and voxelized sparse convolutions in accuracy and efficiency. For example, on ScanNet segmentation it achieves over 10% higher mIoU than MinkowskiNet with 15% of parameters. Visualizations show PointConvFormer behaves similarly to convolution on flat areas but with stronger neighborhood selection at boundaries, combining strengths of both operations. The results demonstrate PointConvFormer could compete with sparse convolution on tasks requiring point-level details.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces PointConvFormer, a new building block for deep neural network architectures that process 3D point clouds. PointConvFormer combines ideas from point convolution and Transformers. In point convolution, the filter weights depend only on relative position between points. Transformers utilize attention computed from feature differences. PointConvFormer computes attention from feature differences between points in a local neighborhood, and uses that attention to reweight the convolutional filter weights at each point. This allows it to preserve the invariances from point convolution, while using attention to selectively aggregate relevant points for the convolution.  

PointConvFormer is evaluated on semantic segmentation using indoor ScanNet and outdoor SemanticKITTI datasets, as well as scene flow estimation using FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets. The results show that PointConvFormer provides a better accuracy-speed tradeoff compared to regular convolution, Transformers, and voxelized sparse convolution approaches. It performs similarly to regular convolution in flat areas but shows a stronger neighborhood selection effect near object boundaries. PointConvFormer could potentially be a strong backbone choice for tasks requiring point-level details like segmentation and scene flow. The code and models will be made publicly available.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces PointConvFormer, a novel building block for point cloud based deep network architectures. PointConvFormer is inspired by generalization theory which indicates that points with significant feature correlation should be included in the same neighborhood. PointConvFormer combines ideas from point convolution, where filter weights are only based on relative position, and Transformers which utilize feature-based attention. In PointConvFormer, attention computed from feature difference between points in the neighborhood is used to modify the convolutional weights at each point. Hence, PointConvFormer preserved the invariances from point convolution, whereas attention helps to select relevant points in the neighborhood for convolution. 

The authors experiment on semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation tasks with datasets including ScanNet, SemanticKitti, FlyingThings3D and KITTI. The results show that PointConvFormer offers a better accuracy-speed tradeoff than classic convolutions, regular transformers, and voxelized sparse convolution approaches. Visualizations indicate that PointConvFormer performs similarly to convolution on flat areas, while the neighborhood selection effect is stronger on object boundaries. This shows PointConvFormer combines the strengths of both convolutions and transformers.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a new building block called PointConvFormer for point cloud-based deep neural networks. The key ideas are:

- Current point convolution methods use k-nearest neighbors to define neighborhoods, but these can include noisy/irrelevant points that hurt performance and robustness. 

- Generalization theory indicates models generalize better when points with high feature correlation are grouped together. 

- PointConvFormer combines ideas from point convolution and transformers. It computes attention based on feature differences to reweight/select relevant points in the neighborhood before convolution.

- This combines the benefits of convolution (viewpoint invariance from relative position, efficiency) and transformers (using features to improve neighborhoods).

- Experiments on semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation tasks show PointConvFormer provides a better accuracy-speed tradeoff compared to regular convolution or transformers alone, and is competitive with state-of-the-art sparse convolutional approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is a new building block for point cloud processing that adaptively selects neighborhoods based on feature correlation, aiming to improve model generalization and robustness compared to standard point convolution or transformers.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper introduces PointConvFormer, a novel building block for point cloud deep learning that combines ideas from point convolution and transformers. Point convolution operates on unordered point sets by learning convolution weights as a function of relative position in local neighborhoods. Transformers utilize attention mechanisms based on feature correlations. PointConvFormer computes an attention score for each neighbor point based on feature differences, and uses that to reweight the convolution kernel at each point. This allows selecting relevant points to perform the convolution on. Experiments on semantic segmentation and scene flow tasks demonstrate superior performance over regular convolution and transformers, especially at lower resolutions. The novel design brings the benefits of both operations - convolution's use of relative position and transformer's attention to feature differences. Ablations verify that PointConvFormer attention works better than dot-product attention from transformers. Visualizations also show PointConvFormer selectively reweights more at object boundaries. Overall, PointConvFormer advances point cloud processing and provides new state-of-the-art results on major datasets while being efficient.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes PointConvFormer, a novel building block for point cloud deep learning models. PointConvFormer combines ideas from point convolution and Transformers. In point convolution, filter weights depend only on relative position of points, lending viewpoint invariance, while Transformers utilize attention between points based on features, which helps select relevant points.
