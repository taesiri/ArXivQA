# Target-Guided Dialogue Response Generation Using Commonsense and Data   Augmentation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses of this paper appear to be:1. Can incorporating commonsense reasoning through explicit commonsense knowledge paths improve the quality and smoothness of target-guided dialogue response generation in low resource settings? 2. Can data augmentation by re-purposing existing dialogue datasets help tackle data scarcity issues for the target-guided response generation task?3. Do standard word overlap based metrics correlate well with human judgements of quality for target-guided dialogue responses? If not, can a learned metric that does not rely on references provide better correlation?In a nutshell, the paper investigates whether utilizing commonsense knowledge paths and data augmentation can improve target-guided dialogue response generation in a low resource setting, and also proposes a new reference-less evaluation metric for this task. The key hypotheses appear to be:- Leveraging commonsense knowledge paths will improve reasoning and lead to higher quality and smoother responses. - Data augmentation will help tackle data scarcity issues.- Standard word overlap metrics will correlate poorly with human judgements, while the proposed learned metric will correlate better.The experiments and results provide support for these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new technique for target-guided response generation in dialog systems. The key idea is to first generate a "bridging path" of commonsense knowledge concepts between the source context and target sentence, and then use this path to guide the generation of a smooth transition response. 2. Introducing data augmentation techniques to re-purpose existing dialog datasets for the task of target-guided response generation, in order to tackle the limited training data.3. Proposing a new automated evaluation metric called Target-Coherence (TC) to assess the quality of transition responses without relying on reference responses. The metric is trained on synthesized negative examples to identify poor transitions.4. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed techniques outperform various baselines in generating higher quality and smoother transitions based on both automatic metrics and human evaluations.5. Providing analysis to highlight benefits of the explicit commonsense reasoning paths, such as improved reasoning, interpretability and controllability over response generation.In summary, the key contributions are introducing novel techniques for controlled response generation using commonsense knowledge paths and data augmentation, proposing a new automated metric for evaluating response transitions, and showing empirical improvements over strong baselines. The explicit reasoning paths also enable better interpretability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper proposes using commonsense knowledge graphs and data augmentation techniques to improve target-guided dialogue response generation, and introduces a new automatic evaluation metric that correlates better with human judgments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper on target-guided dialogue response generation compares to other research in the same field:- It proposes a new technique of first generating commonsense reasoning paths between concepts in the dialogue context and target, and then using those paths to guide the response generation. This differs from prior work that typically just conditions response generation directly on the context and target. - It tackles the problem of data scarcity for this relatively new task by proposing a data augmentation technique to re-purpose existing dialogue datasets. Other papers in this field have not really explored data augmentation.- It identifies issues with standard word overlap metrics like BLEU for evaluating quality of transition responses, and proposes a new trained classification metric that correlates better with human judgments. Most prior work uses standard metrics without much analysis.- It incorporates external commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet to improve reasoning ability. Some other papers have also utilized external knowledge, but this paper handles the sparsity issue in ConceptNet by training generative models over paths rather than retrieving paths.- It demonstrates improved quality of responses through both automatic metrics and human evaluations. Many prior papers lack human evaluation of outputs.- It also highlights controllability benefits by showing how minimal human input can further improve quality by guiding the commonsense reasoning paths. This controllability angle is less explored in prior work.So in summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art for target-guided dialogue response generation by tackling data scarcity through augmentation, improving reasoning by generated commonsense paths, introducing a better evaluation metric, and demonstrating the benefits through rigorous automatic and human evaluations. The controllability experiments also point to promising future work on human-in-the-loop systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are some of the main future research directions suggested in the paper:- Continue to investigate methods for target-guided response generation. The authors propose combining target and non-target guided dialogue planning in future work.- Improve the commonsense path generation component, as they showed that better paths can significantly improve output quality. This includes expanding commonsense knowledge bases and making them less sparse.- Generalize the proposed techniques to conversations with longer context beyond single turn transitions.- Explore controllability of generated responses using human-in-the-loop approaches. The paper showed a preliminary study where providing relevant keywords improved quality. More work can be done on developing mixed-initiative systems.- Address limitations of current systems in qualities like empathy, factual correctness, etc. and equip them with such human-like capabilities.- Mitigate potential biases in the knowledge bases and training datasets to avoid generating problematic responses.- Improve evaluation metrics for dialogue systems, as automated metrics often correlate poorly with human judgments. The proposed Target-Coherence metric is a step in this direction.In summary, the key directions are: improving target-guided and controllable response generation, leveraging external commonsense knowledge better, and generating more human-like responses while avoiding biases and safety issues. Evaluation also remains an open challenge. The authors hope their work provides guidelines for future research on target-guided conversational systems.
