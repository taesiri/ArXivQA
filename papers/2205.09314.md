# Target-Guided Dialogue Response Generation Using Commonsense and Data   Augmentation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses of this paper appear to be:1. Can incorporating commonsense reasoning through explicit commonsense knowledge paths improve the quality and smoothness of target-guided dialogue response generation in low resource settings? 2. Can data augmentation by re-purposing existing dialogue datasets help tackle data scarcity issues for the target-guided response generation task?3. Do standard word overlap based metrics correlate well with human judgements of quality for target-guided dialogue responses? If not, can a learned metric that does not rely on references provide better correlation?In a nutshell, the paper investigates whether utilizing commonsense knowledge paths and data augmentation can improve target-guided dialogue response generation in a low resource setting, and also proposes a new reference-less evaluation metric for this task. The key hypotheses appear to be:- Leveraging commonsense knowledge paths will improve reasoning and lead to higher quality and smoother responses. - Data augmentation will help tackle data scarcity issues.- Standard word overlap metrics will correlate poorly with human judgements, while the proposed learned metric will correlate better.The experiments and results provide support for these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new technique for target-guided response generation in dialog systems. The key idea is to first generate a "bridging path" of commonsense knowledge concepts between the source context and target sentence, and then use this path to guide the generation of a smooth transition response. 2. Introducing data augmentation techniques to re-purpose existing dialog datasets for the task of target-guided response generation, in order to tackle the limited training data.3. Proposing a new automated evaluation metric called Target-Coherence (TC) to assess the quality of transition responses without relying on reference responses. The metric is trained on synthesized negative examples to identify poor transitions.4. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed techniques outperform various baselines in generating higher quality and smoother transitions based on both automatic metrics and human evaluations.5. Providing analysis to highlight benefits of the explicit commonsense reasoning paths, such as improved reasoning, interpretability and controllability over response generation.In summary, the key contributions are introducing novel techniques for controlled response generation using commonsense knowledge paths and data augmentation, proposing a new automated metric for evaluating response transitions, and showing empirical improvements over strong baselines. The explicit reasoning paths also enable better interpretability.
