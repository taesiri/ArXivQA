# [Target-Guided Dialogue Response Generation Using Commonsense and Data   Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09314)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses of this paper appear to be:

1. Can incorporating commonsense reasoning through explicit commonsense knowledge paths improve the quality and smoothness of target-guided dialogue response generation in low resource settings? 

2. Can data augmentation by re-purposing existing dialogue datasets help tackle data scarcity issues for the target-guided response generation task?

3. Do standard word overlap based metrics correlate well with human judgements of quality for target-guided dialogue responses? If not, can a learned metric that does not rely on references provide better correlation?

In a nutshell, the paper investigates whether utilizing commonsense knowledge paths and data augmentation can improve target-guided dialogue response generation in a low resource setting, and also proposes a new reference-less evaluation metric for this task. The key hypotheses appear to be:

- Leveraging commonsense knowledge paths will improve reasoning and lead to higher quality and smoother responses. 

- Data augmentation will help tackle data scarcity issues.

- Standard word overlap metrics will correlate poorly with human judgements, while the proposed learned metric will correlate better.

The experiments and results provide support for these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new technique for target-guided response generation in dialog systems. The key idea is to first generate a "bridging path" of commonsense knowledge concepts between the source context and target sentence, and then use this path to guide the generation of a smooth transition response. 

2. Introducing data augmentation techniques to re-purpose existing dialog datasets for the task of target-guided response generation, in order to tackle the limited training data.

3. Proposing a new automated evaluation metric called Target-Coherence (TC) to assess the quality of transition responses without relying on reference responses. The metric is trained on synthesized negative examples to identify poor transitions.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed techniques outperform various baselines in generating higher quality and smoother transitions based on both automatic metrics and human evaluations.

5. Providing analysis to highlight benefits of the explicit commonsense reasoning paths, such as improved reasoning, interpretability and controllability over response generation.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing novel techniques for controlled response generation using commonsense knowledge paths and data augmentation, proposing a new automated metric for evaluating response transitions, and showing empirical improvements over strong baselines. The explicit reasoning paths also enable better interpretability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes using commonsense knowledge graphs and data augmentation techniques to improve target-guided dialogue response generation, and introduces a new automatic evaluation metric that correlates better with human judgments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on target-guided dialogue response generation compares to other research in the same field:

- It proposes a new technique of first generating commonsense reasoning paths between concepts in the dialogue context and target, and then using those paths to guide the response generation. This differs from prior work that typically just conditions response generation directly on the context and target. 

- It tackles the problem of data scarcity for this relatively new task by proposing a data augmentation technique to re-purpose existing dialogue datasets. Other papers in this field have not really explored data augmentation.

- It identifies issues with standard word overlap metrics like BLEU for evaluating quality of transition responses, and proposes a new trained classification metric that correlates better with human judgments. Most prior work uses standard metrics without much analysis.

- It incorporates external commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet to improve reasoning ability. Some other papers have also utilized external knowledge, but this paper handles the sparsity issue in ConceptNet by training generative models over paths rather than retrieving paths.

- It demonstrates improved quality of responses through both automatic metrics and human evaluations. Many prior papers lack human evaluation of outputs.

- It also highlights controllability benefits by showing how minimal human input can further improve quality by guiding the commonsense reasoning paths. This controllability angle is less explored in prior work.

So in summary, this paper advances the state-of-the-art for target-guided dialogue response generation by tackling data scarcity through augmentation, improving reasoning by generated commonsense paths, introducing a better evaluation metric, and demonstrating the benefits through rigorous automatic and human evaluations. The controllability experiments also point to promising future work on human-in-the-loop systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the main future research directions suggested in the paper:

- Continue to investigate methods for target-guided response generation. The authors propose combining target and non-target guided dialogue planning in future work.

- Improve the commonsense path generation component, as they showed that better paths can significantly improve output quality. This includes expanding commonsense knowledge bases and making them less sparse.

- Generalize the proposed techniques to conversations with longer context beyond single turn transitions.

- Explore controllability of generated responses using human-in-the-loop approaches. The paper showed a preliminary study where providing relevant keywords improved quality. More work can be done on developing mixed-initiative systems.

- Address limitations of current systems in qualities like empathy, factual correctness, etc. and equip them with such human-like capabilities.

- Mitigate potential biases in the knowledge bases and training datasets to avoid generating problematic responses.

- Improve evaluation metrics for dialogue systems, as automated metrics often correlate poorly with human judgments. The proposed Target-Coherence metric is a step in this direction.

In summary, the key directions are: improving target-guided and controllable response generation, leveraging external commonsense knowledge better, and generating more human-like responses while avoiding biases and safety issues. Evaluation also remains an open challenge. The authors hope their work provides guidelines for future research on target-guided conversational systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes methods for target-guided response generation in dialog systems. The goal is to generate a response that smoothly transitions the conversation from a context towards a target sentence. The authors propose using commonsense reasoning by generating paths between entities in the context and target using ConceptNet. A knowledge path generator model is trained to generate commonsense paths between two input entities. These paths are used to condition a response generator model to output more logical transitions. Additionally, the authors propose techniques to augment training data by converting dialogs in DailyDialog into target-guided conversations. They also introduce a Target-Coherence metric to evaluate response smoothness without human references by creating hard negative examples. Experiments show their proposed CODA model outperforms baselines in automatic and human evaluations. The generated commonsense paths provide interpretability. Overall, the work enables better control in steering dialog systems towards conversational goals.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper introduces a new approach for target-guided response generation in dialog systems. The key idea is to use commonsense knowledge paths to help the system generate smooth transitions between a dialog context and a target sentence. Specifically, the proposed method first extracts entities from the context, target, and ground truth response. It then generates commonsense paths between entity pairs using a trained language model over ConceptNet paths. These paths provide relevant background knowledge to help the response generator model transition logically between the context and target. The path generator is trained in a novel way to select paths relevant to the ground truth response. At test time, the path generator creates paths between context and target entities. Finally, the response generator is trained as a conditional model to output an appropriate transition response based on the context, target, and generated commonsense path.

Paragraph 2: In addition to using commonsense paths, the paper also proposes augmenting the limited training data through a two-step process. DailyDialog conversations are converted to target-guided instances by using semantic role labeling to extract clause targets. The converted data is then filtered to only keep smooth transitions based on a proposed coherence metric. Experiments on the Otters dataset show the value of both the commonsense modeling and data augmentation. The full method outperforms baselines on automatic and human evaluations. The paper also demonstrates issues with existing metrics, and shows high correlation between a learned coherence metric and human judgments.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a technique for target-guided response generation in dialog systems. The key idea is to leverage external commonsense knowledge to generate logical transitions between a context and a target sentence. First, the method extracts entities from the context, target, and gold response. Then it generates commonsense paths linking entities in the context to entities in the target using two path generator models - one for training and one for inference. During training, the path generator takes keywords from the gold response to guide path generation. These paths are fed into a response generator model as conditioning to train it to produce responses grounded in commonsense. At inference time, only the context and target entities are used to generate paths. Additionally, the method re-purposes existing dialog data by converting responses into context-target pairs to augment the limited training data. A Target-Coherence metric is proposed to score response transitions without human references by creating hard negative examples. Experiments show the approach outperforms baselines in automatic and human evaluations. Overall, the explicit commonsense reasoning paths enable the generation of higher quality and more interpretable transitions.



## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the task of target-guided response generation in dialog systems. Specifically, it is looking at how to steer a conversation from a dialogue context towards a pre-specified target sentence in a smooth and natural way. 

The key questions and problems the paper tries to tackle are:

- How to generate responses that balance coherence with the dialogue context and smoothly transition the conversation towards the target sentence. This requires making trade-offs between competing objectives.

- Lack of sufficient training data for learning good transition strategies, since existing dialogue datasets consist of free-flowing conversations without any specific goals or targets. 

- Incorporating commonsense reasoning and knowledge to enable generating logical, natural transitions between potentially disparate dialogue context and target sentences. Pretrained language models themselves may lack such reasoning capabilities.

- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for this task, since standard word-overlap metrics often do not correlate well with human judgments of response quality. The paper shows these metrics can be fooled by responses simply repeating the target sentence. 

- Providing interpretability and controllability over the transition generation process. The paper aims to generate explicit commonsense reasoning paths to explain the generated response.

So in summary, the key goals are to generate smooth and natural target-guided responses in a data-efficient way by incorporating commonsense knowledge and developing better evaluation metrics for this challenging conditional text generation task.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes new techniques for target-guided response generation in dialog systems, where the goal is to generate a response that smoothly transitions the conversation from a given context toward a target sentence. The key ideas are 1) Using commonsense knowledge paths between concepts in the context and target to guide response generation, 2) Data augmentation techniques to create more training data, and 3) A new evaluation metric called Target-Coherence that correlates better with human judgments than standard metrics like BLEU. 

Specifically, the authors first find commonsense paths linking concepts in the context and target using models trained on ConceptNet data. The generated paths provide reasoning chains to logically connect the context and target. These paths are fed as input to condition a response generator. To tackle limited training data, conversation datasets like DailyDialog are re-purposed for this task by extracting target clauses from responses using semantic role labeling. The proposed CODA model combining commonsense paths and data augmentation outperforms baselines on automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, a learned metric called Target-Coherence is proposed to evaluate response smoothness which correlates much better with human judgments than word-overlap metrics like BLEU.

In summary, the key contributions are leveraging commonsense reasoning and data augmentation to generate logical and smooth transitions between dialog context and target sentences, and a more reliable automated evaluation metric for this challenging dialog generation task. The proposed techniques offer improved control, explainability and quality for goal-oriented dialog systems.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new technique for target-guided response generation in dialog systems, which aims to steer a conversation from a dialog context towards a specified target sentence. The proposed method first finds a bridging path of commonsense knowledge concepts between the source dialog context and target using the ConceptNet knowledge graph. It then trains two models - a Knowledge Path Generator (KPG) to generate plausible paths between concepts, and a Commonsense Response Generator (CRG) to produce responses conditioned on the generated paths. To tackle the limited training data, the method also augments existing dialog data to create context-target pairs. Experiments demonstrate that conditioning response generation on commonsense paths leads to higher quality and more coherent responses compared to baselines. The paper also proposes a new automated metric called Target-Coherence for evaluating response smoothness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes generating commonsense paths between source and target concepts using ConceptNet, and then using these paths to generate transition responses. How robust is this approach to sparsity in ConceptNet? Could it fail to find useful paths between concepts not well covered in ConceptNet?

2. The commonsense paths are generated using random walks on the ConceptNet graph. How sensitive is the approach to the specifics of the random walk algorithm, such as walk length, edge filtering, etc.? Have the authors experimented with different random walk strategies?

3. The paper claims the commonsense paths provide interpretability. However, evaluating the true meaning and validity of commonsense paths seems non-trivial. Are the generated paths actually meaningful and coherent? How could this be evaluated rigorously?

4. The paper uses a data augmentation strategy to create pseudo target-guided instances from DailyDialog. This seems like a weak form of supervision. Does the data augmentation actually help improve performance? Have other data augmentation strategies been tried? 

5. The paper proposes a Target-Coherence metric for evaluating responses without human references. However, training the metric requires creating synthetic negative examples. How reliable and robust is the metric based on these synthetic negatives?

6. The paper shows good results on Otters dataset. How does the approach compare against other strong baselines on larger benchmark datasets? How does it scale to longer conversations beyond one-turn transitions?

7. The paper uses a simple approach of selecting one path for response generation. Could conditioning on multiple diverse paths improve the consistency and coherence further? How about generating multiple responses and re-ranking or combining them?

8. The paper demonstrates controllability of responses by conditioning on input keywords. Are there other ways controllability could be achieved, for example by modifying or editing the generated paths?

9. Error analysis reveals the approach is sensitive to poor keyword extraction and irrelevant path generation. Are there ways to improve keyword extraction and filtering of irrelevant paths? How big a problem is irrelevant path generation?

10. The paper focuses on coherent target-guided response generation. However, over-steering towards targets can make conversations unnatural. How can the approach balance target-coherence against conversation flow? Are there ways to softly combine target-guided and non-target-guided responses?
