# [CapDet: Unifying Dense Captioning and Open-World Detection Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02489)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an object detector that can effectively detect and describe novel objects not present in the training data. The key hypotheses are:1. Unifying open-world object detection (predicting objects from a predefined list) and dense captioning (generating natural language descriptions of image regions) into one framework will result in a model capable of both accurately detecting known objects and describing unknown objects.2. Adding a dense captioning objective during pretraining will improve the generalization performance of open-world object detection, since the captioning data covers a wider variety of visual concepts.3. The proposed model, CapDet, will outperform previous methods on open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results on dense captioning.In summary, the paper proposes that jointly training for known object detection and novel object description will produce a model with stronger generalization abilities for detecting and describing unknown objects compared to training the tasks separately. The central hypothesis is that the dense captioning task will act as a form of regularization to learn more robust visual representations.
