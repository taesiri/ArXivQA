# [Webly Supervised Concept Expansion for General Purpose Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02317)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using web image search data to expand the concept vocabulary of general purpose vision (GPV) models beyond what is covered in existing supervised datasets. The key idea is that image search engines provide high-quality, on-demand results for a diverse range of visual concepts at very low cost. The authors collect a new dataset called WEB10K spanning over 10K noun concepts, 300 verbs, and 150 adjectives using Bing image search, which costs only $150. They convert the image-query pairs into question-answering format to remove ambiguity. 

The paper demonstrates that two existing GPVs, GPV-1 and VL-T5, as well as a newly proposed model called GPV-2, can effectively learn concepts from the WEB10K dataset in a multi-task framework. All models show consistent gains on the out-of-domain OpenSCE benchmark (492 concepts) without losing in-domain COCO performance. GPV-2 combines detections with the T5 text decoder and outperforms prior models, especially benefiting from web data. A key advantage of GPV-2 is supporting region-based outputs to enable localization and context-based classification. It also employs score calibration to handle tail concepts better. Qualitative results demonstrate an ability to recognize rare concepts like "sari" or "gondola" when trained with web data. A case study on COVID-related concepts shows GPV-2 can quickly adapt to new visual concepts using web search.

Overall, this work shows web search provides an inexpensive way to expand GPV concept vocabulary, with the benefit of accessing the latest concepts unavailable in static datasets. Multi-task learning allows transfer of web concepts to multiple vision and vision-language skills. The introduction of WEB10K, OpenSCE benchmark, and GPV-2 model significantly advance the capabilities and evaluation of general purpose vision systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new large-scale webly-supervised dataset and benchmark for expanding general purpose vision models to a vocabulary of 10,000+ visual concepts, and proposes a new GPV architecture, GPV-2, that more effectively transfers concepts across vision skills and outperforms prior GPV models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Web10K, a new web data source to learn over 10k visual concepts with an accompanying human-verified VQA benchmark.

2) Demonstration that general purpose vision models (GPVs) can learn concepts from Web10K and transfer this knowledge to other tasks. 

3) OpenSCE, a benchmark spanning 5 tasks and approximately 500 concepts to evaluate GPVs.

4) GPV2, an architecture that supports box and text modalities in both input and output, improves skill-concept transfer and outperforms existing GPVs.

In summary, the paper shows that web image search data can be used to efficiently and inexpensively expand the concept vocabulary of GPV models across a variety of visual tasks, without compromising in-domain performance. The proposed GPV2 model outperforms prior GPV architectures, especially when trained jointly on web data.
