# [GP-NAS-ensemble: a model for NAS Performance Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to build an accurate and robust model for predicting the performance of neural network architectures, especially when only a small training dataset is available. 

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new NAS framework called GP-NAS-ensemble to predict neural network architecture performance. This is based on the GP-NAS model.

- The GP-NAS model uses Gaussian process regression to predict architecture accuracy. The key components are estimating the prior mean and defining the kernel function. 

- To improve GP-NAS, the paper makes several modifications:

1) Uses one-hot and two-hot encoding for feature engineering to better represent similarities between architectures. 

2) Transforms the accuracy labels by guessing their distribution rather than directly predicting ranks.

3) Introduces a weighted ensemble kernel function to focus on different feature subsets per task.

4) Constructs an ensemble model of multiple GP-NAS learners to improve robustness.

- Experiments show these modifications boost the public leaderboard score substantially compared to the baseline GP-NAS.

In summary, the core research question is how to build a robust neural architecture performance predictor using ideas like feature engineering, ensembling, and label transformation when training data is limited. The proposed GP-NAS-ensemble framework provides one way to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel NAS performance prediction model called GP-NAS-ensemble. The key ideas are:

1. Improving the feature representation of the model architectures by using one-hot and two-hot encoding to better capture the similarities between architectural choices. 

2. Transforming the accuracy labels by guessing their distribution and sampling scores from it rather than just predicting ranks.

3. Using an ensemble of GP-NAS and other supervised learning models with a weighted kernel function to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. 

4. The proposed GP-NAS-ensemble model achieves significantly better performance on the public leaderboard of the CVPR 2022 NAS competition compared to the original GP-NAS model.

In summary, the paper proposes several enhancements to the GP-NAS method for NAS performance prediction, and shows the effectiveness of the resulting GP-NAS-ensemble model through ablation studies and evaluation on the CVPR 2022 competition dataset. The improvements come from better feature engineering, label transformation, using an ensemble, and learning a weighted kernel function.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel neural architecture search framework called GP-NAS-ensemble that improves upon the GP-NAS model by using ensemble learning techniques to more accurately predict the performance of neural network architectures when only a small training dataset is available.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in neural architecture search and performance prediction:

- This paper proposes an ensemble approach to performance prediction called GP-NAS-ensemble. This builds on prior work like GP-NAS but adds ensemble techniques to improve accuracy. Using ensemble methods for performance prediction is a relatively new idea compared to other work.

- The paper focuses on performance prediction with small training datasets. Many other papers in this field rely on large datasets of architecture-performance pairs. Developing methods that work well with limited data is an important direction.

- For feature engineering, this paper uses both one-hot and two-hot encoding to capture categorical feature similarities. Other papers often use just one-hot encoding. The two-hot idea seems innovative for this application.

- The weighted kernel and label transformation techniques are also not commonly used in prior NAS prediction papers. These provide ways to tailor the model more closely to each task.

- The work incorporates classical ML models like SVR as base learners in the ensemble, alongside GP-NAS base models. Blending classical and neural methods is less common than using either alone.

- Compared to some other state-of-the-art prediction methods, the techniques explored here are relatively simple. Many competitors use more complex neural network architectures. The success of this straightforward ensemble approach is notable.

Overall, while built on existing ideas like GP-NAS, this paper innovates in areas like ensemble learning, feature encoding, and incorporating classical ML ideas. The techniques are simple but effective, and provide useful directions for further work on NAS performance prediction, especially with limited data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing unsupervised neural rendering methods that do not require paired training data. The current method relies on paired underwater/in-air data for training, which limits performance. Unsupervised learning could help overcome this limitation.

- Exploring different neural architecture search spaces and search algorithms. The GP-NAS-ensemble model focuses on modifying and ensembling the GP-NAS method. Trying different NAS techniques could further improve performance prediction.

- Applying the GP-NAS-ensemble model to other prediction tasks beyond lightweight NAS, such as predicting performance on larger datasets or different computer vision tasks. This could demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. 

- Incorporating additional features into the GP-NAS model, such as information about the operations in the architecture or hardware efficiency measurements. The current features are mainly architectural hyperparameters, so adding more descriptive features could improve accuracy.

- Validating the approach on larger datasets and benchmark tasks to further demonstrate its effectiveness. The experiments are currently limited to the small datasets provided in the CVPR competition.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why the modifications to GP-NAS improve performance, such as analyzing the effects of the weighted kernel and label transformations. This could lead to further optimizations.

In summary, the main future directions are developing unsupervised methods, trying different NAS techniques, applying the model to new tasks/datasets, incorporating additional features, and theoretically analyzing the improvements to GP-NAS. Expanding the applications and interpretations of the model seem to be the key next steps suggested.
