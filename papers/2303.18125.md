# [Towards Nonlinear-Motion-Aware and Occlusion-Robust Rolling Shutter   Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18125)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: How can rolling shutter correction be improved for complex nonlinear motion and scenes with extreme occlusion?The authors state that existing methods for rolling shutter correction have two main limitations:1) They struggle to estimate accurate correction fields under complex nonlinear motion, due to relying on assumptions like uniform velocity or being unable to effectively supervise the correction field during training. This leads to errors when correcting images.2) In dynamic scenes with extreme occlusion, existing methods have difficulty aligning and aggregating information across multiple frames to reconstruct high quality images.To address these issues, the paper proposes:1) A geometry-based quadratic rolling shutter motion solver that can precisely estimate high-order correction fields for each pixel, by modeling pixel trajectories analytically.2) A 3D video architecture called RSA^2-Net that can effectively align and aggregate information across multiple frames to reconstruct high quality images even with extreme occlusion.The central hypothesis appears to be that by addressing these two limitations through the proposed quadratic motion solver and RSA^2-Net, rolling shutter correction can be significantly improved, especially for complex nonlinear motion and dynamic occlusion scenes. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
