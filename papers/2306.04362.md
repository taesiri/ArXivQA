# Youku-mPLUG: A 10 Million Large-scale Chinese Video-Language Dataset for   Pre-training and Benchmarks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we facilitate research and development of Chinese video-language pre-training models by providing a large-scale, high-quality Chinese video-language dataset and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluation?The key aspects related to this question appear to be:- Releasing the first large-scale, high-quality Chinese video-language dataset called Youku-mPLUG with 10 million video-text pairs for pre-training and 365K manually annotated samples for downstream benchmarks. - Building comprehensive downstream benchmarks covering video-text retrieval, video captioning, and video category classification to enable thorough evaluation of video-language models.- Proposing a modularized decoder-only model called mPLUG-Video pre-trained on Youku-mPLUG that achieves new state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks.- Demonstrating the zero-shot instruction understanding and video comprehension abilities of the scaled up mPLUG-Video based on a frozen language model.So in summary, the paper aims to promote Chinese video-language research by releasing a high-quality dataset, evaluation benchmarks, strong baseline models pre-trained on this dataset, and showing their abilities for downstream tasks and zero-shot generalization. The availability of these resources can facilitate more in-depth research and development of Chinese video-language pre-training models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The release of a new large-scale Chinese video-language dataset called Youku-mPLUG, containing 10 million video-text pairs for pre-training and 0.3 million videos for downstream benchmarks. This is described as the largest public Chinese high-quality video-language dataset.2. The creation of Chinese video-language benchmarks covering cross-modal retrieval, video captioning, and video category classification, to facilitate evaluation of video-language models. These are claimed to be the largest human-annotated Chinese benchmarks.3. The release of popular video-language models (ALPRO and mPLUG-2) pre-trained on the Youku-mPLUG dataset. 4. The proposal of a new modularized decoder-only model called mPLUG-video that is pre-trained on Youku-mPLUG. This model achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks.5. Scaling up mPLUG-video as a Chinese multimodal large language model with only 1.7% trainable parameters. Experiments demonstrate its strong zero-shot instruction and video understanding abilities.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the creation and release of a large-scale Chinese video-language dataset, accompanying benchmarks, and pre-trained models that advance the state-of-the-art for Chinese video-language tasks. The datasets and models aim to promote research and applications in this domain.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper introduces Youku-mPLUG, a new large-scale Chinese video-language dataset for pre-training. This contributes a much-needed resource to the Chinese research community, as most existing large video-language datasets are in English (e.g. HowTo100M, WebVid-2.5M). The scale and quality of Youku-mPLUG seems comparable or superior to other Chinese video-text datasets like ALIVOL-10M and CREATE-10M.- The paper presents benchmark evaluations for video-text retrieval, video captioning, and video classification on Youku-mPLUG. This provides standardized benchmarks for the Chinese community, similar to what existing datasets like MSRVTT have done for English. The benchmarks seem quite comprehensive and larger in scale than previous Chinese evaluation sets.- The proposed mPLUG-video model architecture follows recent trends in modularized and decoder-only architectures for multimodality (e.g. mPLUG, BLIP). Using a frozen pretrained language model decoder mirrors approaches like BLIP and Align-R. The innovations seem incremental on existing methods.- The zero-shot instruction understanding experiments are interesting but quite preliminary. More rigorous evaluations may be needed to demonstrate robust zero-shot abilities like recent video LLMs. The qualitative results do suggest potential for leveraging Youku-mPLUG.- Overall, while not presenting major technical breakthroughs, the dataset and benchmarks are a valuable contribution. The mPLUG-video results demonstrate the usefulness of Youku-mPLUG for Chinese video-language research. More work is needed to show significant zero-shot gains. But this provides a strong starting point and evaluation suite for future Chinese VLP research.In summary, the paper makes key contributions in terms of resources and evaluation suites for the Chinese VLP community. The modeling and experiments are solid, if not groundbreaking. As an initial effort, it paves the way for future advances in Chinese video-language AI.
