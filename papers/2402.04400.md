# [CEHR-GPT: Generating Electronic Health Records with Chronological   Patient Timelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for generating synthetic EHR data fail to adequately capture temporal dependencies, which are critical for understanding patient health trajectories and developing effective treatments. 
- Most methods use a tabular format that discards temporal order or do not generate timestamps to situate medical events.
- Generated data is also difficult to disseminate due to lack of common data formats. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel patient representation that retains complete timelines with patient demographics, visit details, time intervals between visits and timing of medical events.
- Treat patient sequence generation as a language modeling problem using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT).
- Seamlessly convert synthetic sequences into Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model format.

Contributions:
- Designed a patient representation that captures temporal dependencies and enables lossless conversion between EHR data and patient sequences.
- Used GPT to learn distribution of patient sequences and generate new synthetic sequences.
- Converted synthetic sequences into OMOP format for easy dissemination and analysis.  
- Evaluated synthetic data on dimension distributions, co-occurrence relationships and machine learning model performance.
- Showed proposed method replicates intricate patterns in real EHR data better than baseline models.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end framework to generate synthetic EHR data that retains critical temporal dependencies within patient histories. The use of a tailored patient representation and GPT model allows accurate modeling of real-world patient timelines. Conversion into the OMOP standard format also enables wider adoption of the synthetic data. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the utility of the framework.
