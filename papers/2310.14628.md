# [Plan, Verify and Switch: Integrated Reasoning with Diverse X-of-Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14628)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes XoT, a novel integrated mathematical reasoning framework that leverages the complementarity of diverse reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Program-of-Thought (PoT), and the newly introduced Equation-of-Thought (EoT). XoT consists of three key modules - planning, reasoning, and verification - that work iteratively. The planning module first selects the most suitable reasoning method based on the question. The reasoning module then generates a solution using that method. Crucially, XoT actively verifies the solution using both passive checks (e.g. runtime errors) and active reasoning (e.g. checking against question conditions). If the solution fails verification, XoT plans and switches to an alternative method in the next iteration. This flexible framework allows XoT to exploit the strengths of different reasoning approaches. Extensive experiments on 10 math reasoning datasets demonstrate XoT's effectiveness, outperforming individual methods by 5-7% on average. Ablation studies analyze each module, showing the value of planning, reasoning with multiple methods, and the verification strategies. Further experiments suggest XoT can generalize to logic reasoning. Overall, by enabling adaptive switching between diverse reasoning thoughts, XoT provides a novel perspective on integrating complementary reasoning approaches within a unified framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes XoT, an integrated problem solving framework that utilizes diverse reasoning thoughts to prompt large language models (LLMs). XoT consists of three main modules - planning, reasoning, and verification - that work iteratively. For a given question, the planning module first selects the most suitable reasoning method from options like chain-of-thought (CoT), program-of-thought (PoT), and equation-of-thought (EoT). The reasoning module then generates a solution using the chosen method. Next, the verification module evaluates the solution through passive verification (using external tools) and active verification (rethinking the solution). If the solution fails verification, XoT switches to a different reasoning method in the next iteration. Through experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, the authors demonstrate XoT's ability to effectively combine complementary strengths of different prompting approaches. The results also show XoT generalizes to logical reasoning. By enabling method switching based on verification, XoT provides a new perspective on integrating diverse reasoning thoughts within a unified framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an integrated mathematical problem solving framework called XoT that allows large language models to flexibly switch between different reasoning methods like chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, and equation-of-thought in an iterative process, leveraging complementary strengths to improve overall reasoning ability.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that large language models (LLMs) can achieve better performance on math reasoning tasks by integrating and switching between diverse reasoning methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Program of Thought (PoT), and Equation of Thought (EoT). 

The key claims are:

- Different reasoning methods like CoT, PoT and EoT have complementary strengths and limitations. Using multiple methods collaboratively can unlock synergistic benefits beyond any single approach.

- An integrated framework named XoT is proposed, which allows switching among different reasoning methods based on verification of the solutions. XoT consists of planning, reasoning and verification modules working iteratively.

- Verification is done actively by asking the model to check the solution, and passively by executing the generated programs. This facilitates informed decisions on whether to reattempt using a different method.

- Experiments show consistent improvements across math reasoning datasets by using XoT to combine multiple reasoning approaches, compared to individual methods. The framework also generalizes to logical reasoning tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that flexibly switching between diverse reasoning methods can improve LLM performance on math and logical reasoning, which is validated through the proposed XoT framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing XoT, an integrated problem solving framework that utilizes diverse reasoning thoughts (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Program-of-Thought, Equation-of-Thought) to prompt large language models. The key ideas include:

- Showing the complementarity of different reasoning methods on math problems, and integrating them in an iterative framework that can switch among methods based on verification of the solutions.

- Introducing a new prompting method called Equation-of-Thought that models math problems as systems of linear equations.

- Demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines on 10 math reasoning datasets. The framework is also shown to generalize to logical reasoning tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing XoT, an integrated reasoning framework that combines diverse reasoning thoughts in a unified architecture with method switching based on verification. This provides a new perspective on collaborative integration of different reasoning approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper proposes XoT, an integrated framework for mathematical reasoning that combines multiple prompting methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Program-of-Thought (PoT), and the newly proposed Equation-of-Thought (EoT). The key novelty is the ability to dynamically switch between these diverse reasoning approaches based on verification, unlike prior work that focuses on improving individual methods.

- The paper demonstrates the complementarity of different prompting methods, showing their combined potential exceeds any single approach. This is a new perspective compared to prior work that viewed prompting techniques in isolation or as competing alternatives. 

- XoT incorporates both passive verification using program execution and active verification where the model checks its own solution. This facilitates informed decisions on when to switch methods. Other iterative refinement techniques mainly reuse the same approach.

- Empirical results show XoT outperforms majority voting ensembles and repetitive self-refinement. The gains are more significant on complex datasets where complementarity is higher. This underscores the benefits of exploring alternative thoughts.

- XoT provides a generalizable reasoning framework, as evidenced by additional experiments on logical reasoning tasks. Prior work is mostly tailored to specific domains like mathematics.

- Overall, the paper introduces a novel collaborative perspective on integrating diverse reasoning approaches. By allowing method switching based on reliable verification, XoT achieves flexible reasoning superior to committing to any single method. This provides a promising new direction for unlocking LLM reasoning abilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Exploring the generalizability of their approach to more diverse tasks beyond math and logical reasoning. They mention that XoT currently relies on the availability of diverse prompting methods, so further research is needed to explore new problem solving methods for more general reasoning tasks.

- Improving the performance of XoT on smaller language models. The authors observe that XoT works better on larger models and the inherent complementarity of different methods is not yet fully unleashed in the current design when using smaller models. 

- Enhancing the verification module for CoT. Currently, the verification module of XoT is specially designed for PoT and EoT methods. The authors suggest exploring a more effective verification approach for CoT as well.

- Applying XoT to more reasoning domains. The authors demonstrate XoT's applicability on logical reasoning tasks, underscoring its potential as a general problem solving framework. They consider generalizing XoT to more diverse tasks an interesting avenue for future work.

In summary, the main future directions are: exploring new prompting methods, improving performance on smaller models, enhancing verification for CoT, and applying XoT to more reasoning domains beyond math and logic. The overarching goal is to further develop XoT as a generalized reasoning framework.
