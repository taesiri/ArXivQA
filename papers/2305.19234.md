# [Grammar Prompting for Domain-Specific Language Generation with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19234)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper explores using grammar prompting as an approach to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate strings from structured, domain-specific languages (DSLs) after being trained on just a handful of examples. 

The key hypothesis is that augmenting demonstration examples with specialized grammars that are minimally sufficient to generate the example outputs will allow LLMs to better acquire and apply the constraints and semantics of a complex DSL from a small number of examples.

The paper tests this hypothesis across a diverse set of DSLs for semantic parsing, AI planning, and molecule generation. The results generally support the hypothesis, showing that grammar prompting can improve upon standard prompting baselines in the few-shot setting across these domains.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that grammar prompting, where each example is augmented with a specialized grammar, can enable few-shot learning of complex DSLs with LLMs. The experiments on diverse DSLs provide evidence supporting this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "grammar prompting" to improve the few-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for generating outputs in highly structured domain-specific languages (DSLs). 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Augment each demonstration example with a "specialized" BNF grammar that is minimally sufficient to generate that particular output. This grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar.

- During inference, first predict a BNF grammar given the input, and then generate the output according to the predicted grammar.

- The specialized grammar focuses the LLM on the necessary symbolic manipulations needed for the given input-output pair.

- The use of a formal BNF grammar also allows imposing syntactic constraints during decoding.

Experiments show that grammar prompting improves few-shot learning for diverse DSL generation tasks like semantic parsing, PDDL planning, and molecule generation. This demonstrates the potential of harnessing LLMs for structured language generation by combining their pretrained skills with external knowledge expressed through grammars.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating the grammar prompting method to improve few-shot structured language generation with LLMs. The approach draws on the metalanguage capabilities acquired through pretraining while using grammars to focus reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using specialized context-free grammars within prompts to improve few-shot learning of structured language generation tasks like semantic parsing and molecule generation with large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on grammar prompting for domain-specific language generation compares to other related work:

- It focuses on using large language models (LLMs) for few-shot learning of structured outputs, whereas much prior work trains specialized models for domain-specific languages. The idea is to leverage the pretraining capabilities of LLMs instead of training extensive task-specific models.

- It proposes representing domain knowledge and constraints through Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammars provided during prompting. This differs from other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought that use natural language reasoning steps. Using BNF enables imposing syntax constraints during decoding.

- The paper shows grammar prompting improving LLMs on diverse DSL tasks - semantic parsing, PDDL planning, molecule generation. So it demonstrates wider applicability than methods tackling individual domains.

- For semantic parsing, it targets few-shot learning from only 16-32 examples, while related LLM work relies on retrieving hundreds of training examples. The paper also shows grammar prompting helps on compositional generalization.

- It integrates grammar prediction into prompting, rather than just providing the full grammar upfront. This elicits more reasoning from the LLM to specialize the grammar.

- The approach is simple compared to methods that train specialized grammar models or incorporate grammars into model architectures. The paper also empirically compares against several prompting baselines.

Overall, this paper establishes grammar prompting as an effective technique for few-shot DSL generation across diverse domains. The key novelty is using BNF grammars during prompting to provide domain structure and constraints. The paper thoroughly evaluates the approach on many tasks and offers comparisons to other prompting techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring whether finetuning of moderately-sized language models using specialized grammars can lead to better grammar-based models for domain-specific language generation. The authors mention this as a potential way to improve the capabilities of LLMs for comprehending and applying formal grammars.

- Combining grammar prompting with chain-of-thought style prompts by manually providing natural language comments to the rules of specialized grammars. The authors found this yielded slight improvements on some tasks, indicating it may be a promising direction.

- Applying the approach to domain-specific languages like SELFIES that guarantee chemical validity, unlike SMILES. The authors suggest this as an interesting avenue since constraints can be more strictly enforced with valid languages.

- Using grammar prompting to tackle DSL-open benchmarks like LARC where new functions may be introduced at test time. The authors' experiments on unseen functions indicate the potential of the approach for such settings. 

- Incorporating additional reasoning capacities from LLMs to augment existing classical planners, beyond using LLMs for action selection as explored in the paper. For example, having the LLM induce action models, macro-actions, sub-tasks, or generalized plans.

- Exploring scientific discovery by representing hypotheses as programs in domain-specific languages, then using techniques like grammar prompting to apply constraints and prior knowledge. The authors suggest grammar prompting could expand the scope of scientific problems to which LLMs can be effectively applied.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving grammar-based modeling for LLMs, combining grammar prompting with other techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, applying the approach to new settings and tasks, and using it as a mechanism for imbuing scientific knowledge and constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores grammar prompting as a method for enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate strings from highly structured languages, such as domain-specific languages (DSLs), given only a small number of demonstrations. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar, expressed in Backus-Naur form, that is minimally sufficient to generate that particular example output. The specialized grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a grammar based on the input, and then generates the output according to the predicted grammar's rules. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting improves the few-shot performance of LLMs on diverse DSL generation tasks including semantic parsing, PDDL planning, and molecule generation. The use of formal grammars allows the incorporation of external knowledge and constraints into the LLM's few-shot reasoning process. Overall, grammar prompting is a simple yet effective approach for getting LLMs to generate highly structured outputs in a data-efficient manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores using grammar prompting to improve few-shot learning of domain-specific languages (DSLs) with large language models (LLMs). DSLs often incorporate domain-specific abstractions and semantics that are difficult to convey through just a few demonstration examples. The authors propose grammar prompting, which augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient to generate that example. This grammar is expressed in Backus-Naur form (BNF) and serves to provide external knowledge about the DSL's structure. During inference, the LLM first predicts a specialized BNF grammar based on the input, then generates the output according to the predicted grammar's rules. 

Experiments apply grammar prompting to diverse DSLs including for semantic parsing, PDDL planning, and molecule generation. Results demonstrate that grammar prompting can meaningfully improve upon standard prompting baselines in the few-shot regime across these domains. The approach enables drawing on an LLM's strengths in metalanguage and symbolic manipulation. While not intended to surpass state-of-the-art domain-specific models, the results indicate grammar prompting allows tapping into LLMs' potential for data-efficient learning in structured domains. Limitations are that constraints from predicted grammars can sometimes decrease diversity of generated outputs. Nonetheless, the work provides a simple and promising method for few-shot learning of structured languages with LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called "grammar prompting" to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate strings from highly structured languages with only a few examples. 

The key idea is to augment each example input-output pair with a specialized grammar in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) that contains just enough rules to generate that particular output. During training, the LLM sees examples of natural language inputs paired with specialized grammars and corresponding structured outputs. At test time, the LLM first predicts a specialized BNF grammar based on the new input, then generates the output conditioned on following that predicted grammar.

The specialized grammars allow the LLM to incorporate domain-specific constraints and semantics that are difficult to learn from just input-output examples. By predicting intermediate grammars, the method also focuses the LLM on symbolic manipulation capabilities rather than just mimicking examples. Experiments show that grammar prompting improves performance on diverse structured language generation tasks like semantic parsing, PDDL planning, and SMILES molecular syntax compared to standard prompting. So the core novelty is using specialized BNF grammars during few-shot learning to provide an inductive bias towards composing outputs symbolically.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the challenge of few-shot learning for large language models (LLMs) on tasks that involve generating strings in highly structured languages, like domain-specific languages (DSLs). 

Some key points:

- DSLs often incorporate domain-specific abstractions and semantics that are difficult to capture through just a few demonstration examples. 

- Unlike general programming languages, DSLs are specialized by definition and so LLMs are unlikely to have encountered them frequently enough during pretraining to acquire their full syntax.

- So it is challenging to draw on the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for applications where they must generate strings in a structured output space that is very different from what was seen during pretraining.

- The paper explores "grammar prompting" as a way to enable LLMs to make use of external knowledge and domain-specific constraints for few-shot learning of DSL generation tasks. 

- Grammar prompting expresses domain knowledge through a context-free grammar in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) and augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient to generate that particular output. 

- During inference, the LLM first predicts the BNF grammar given a new input, then generates the output according to the predicted grammar's rules.

- This approach allows the LLM to incorporate external constraints and domain knowledge through the formal grammar during few-shot learning. Experiments show it improves performance on diverse DSL generation tasks compared to standard prompting baselines.

In summary, the key focus is improving few-shot learning for structured language generation by enabling LLMs to leverage external knowledge and constraints expressed through formal grammars.
