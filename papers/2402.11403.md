# [An Empirical Evaluation of Neural and Neuro-symbolic Approaches to   Real-time Multimodal Complex Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11403)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robots and autonomous systems need to understand complex events (CEs) over long time periods using noisy sensor data in order to interact with humans and environments. 
- End-to-end neural networks have limitations in context size and reasoning ability for identifying CEs. 
- Recent complex event processing (CEP) systems using neuro-symbolic methods combine neural networks with symbolic models based on human knowledge, but there lacks thorough comparison between these approaches for complex event detection (CED).

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate a multimodal CED task to recognize CEs in real-time from IMU and audio streams.
- Evaluate end-to-end neural architectures, two-stage concept-based neural architectures, and a neuro-symbolic architecture.
- The neuro-symbolic architecture uses a symbolic finite-state machine (FSM) to detect CEs from a sequence of atomic events (AEs) extracted by a neural network.

Contributions:
- Designed a stochastic simulator to synthesize a multimodal dataset of CEs with complicated temporal relations between AEs.
- Empirically analyzed neural and neuro-symbolic models on the CED task.
- Showed the neuro-symbolic architecture consistently outperforms purely neural architectures by 41% average F1 score. Outperformance holds even when neural models were trained on large CE dataset and saw the full temporal context.
- Studied model performance with varying neural network architectures and training sizes. Transformer-based networks have potential for better performance with more training data.

In summary, the paper clearly identifies limitations of neural networks for complex temporal event reasoning tasks. The proposed neuro-symbolic solution effectively injects human knowledge into the system. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of neuro-symbolic methods over end-to-end neural solutions.
