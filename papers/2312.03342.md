# [Topic and genre in dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03342)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper argues for clearly distinguishing between the concepts of genre and topic when analyzing conversations, in order to enable the creation of reliable and controllable open-domain dialogue systems. The authors discuss how genre constrains the surface structure of a conversation while content plays a more detailed role. They argue that formalizing topics and the relationships between them can lead to hierarchical modeling that captures content structure. The paper also examines the inherent variability in how conversational goals can be achieved based on factors like formality, social dynamics, and tangents. The authors posit that better understanding the interaction between topics and genres could improve modularization when designing dialogue systems. They propose that genre can serve as an abstraction to identify relevant dialogue patterns in a domain. However, the complexity of automatic topic modeling poses challenges. The authors suggest that developing annotation standards for hierarchical topical structure across genres could facilitate analysis and adaptation of systems to particular conversational genres. In summary, separating notions of genre and topic and studying their interplay may lead to more flexible dialogue systems.
