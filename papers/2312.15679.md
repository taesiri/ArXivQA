# [BDIS-SLAM: A lightweight CPU-based dense stereo SLAM for surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15679)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing dense SLAM systems for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) require high-end parallel computing resources (GPUs) for real-time performance. However, GPUs may need to be allocated to other tasks like segmentation or detection.  
- There is a need for a lightweight dense stereo SLAM system that can work on a single CPU core in real-time.

Proposed Solution - BDIS-SLAM:
- Integrates a new dense stereo mapping module with ORB-SLAM2 backbone for localization. 
- Uses Bayesian Dense Inverse Searching (BDIS) for real-time stereo matching and shape recovery on CPU. BDIS is faster and slightly more accurate than prior methods.
- Implements a simplified strategy to fuse shapes rather than expensive deformation estimation. Sacrifices accuracy for speed.  
- Overall, it is the first CPU-level dense stereo SLAM system focused on achieving real-time performance.

Main Contributions:
- First lightweight dense stereo SLAM system for MIS that works on single CPU core
- Integrates recently proposed BDIS stereo algorithm with ORB-SLAM2 in a new thread
- Uses simplified fusion approach for faster performance instead of accurate deformation
- Achieves 30Hz on 640x480 images on modern CPU, only 12% slower than ORB-SLAM2 backbone
- Releases C++ open source implementation to enable applications in surgical robots and AR

In summary, the paper proposes the first real-time dense stereo SLAM system for MIS that can operate on computationally constrained devices by using a lightweight stereo approach and fusion strategy. It enables 3D mapping in scenarios where GPU resources need to be allocated to other tasks.
