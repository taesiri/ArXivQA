# [A Unified Taxonomy-Guided Instruction Tuning Framework for Entity Set   Expansion and Taxonomy Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies three key entity enrichment tasks that can expand taxonomies: Entity Set Expansion, Taxonomy Expansion, and Seed-Guided Taxonomy Construction. Prior work has addressed these tasks separately using heterogeneous techniques. However, the authors argue that these tasks share the common goals of finding sibling entities and finding parent entities. Hence, a unified perspective is needed.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes TaxoInstruct, a unified taxonomy-guided instruction tuning framework to jointly solve the three tasks. The key idea is to leverage existing taxonomies to generate self-supervision data for finding siblings and parents. Specifically, they instruct a large language model (LLM) to find sibling and parent entities based on taxonomy structures and then use the LLM's outputs to expand taxonomies.

The framework has three main components:
1) Utilize taxonomy structures to create self-supervision data containing sibling-sibling and parent-child relationships.
2) Perform unified taxonomy-guided instruction tuning to train the LLM on understanding taxonomic relations.
3) Apply the fine-tuned LLM to downstream tasks - either directly for inference or with further task-specific tuning.

Main Contributions:
1) A unified perspective and solution to three entity enrichment tasks based on their shared taxonomy-understanding goals.
2) A taxonomy-guided instruction tuning approach that leverages existing taxonomies as rich supervisory signals.
3) Extensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of TaxoInstruct across all three tasks.

In summary, this paper makes both conceptual and technical contributions in unifying heterogeneous entity enrichment tasks under one taxonomy-aware framework via instruction tuning, outperforming prior task-specific techniques.
