# [Token-Ensemble Text Generation: On Attacking the Automatic AI-Generated   Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11167)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models like ChatGPT are advancing rapidly, making it harder to detect AI-generated text. Existing detection methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like paraphrasing. 
- There is a need for more sophisticated attacks to evaluate the robustness of AI-generated text detection systems.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a "token-ensemble attack" that generates text by randomly selecting candidate language models to produce each subsequent token. 
- This attack exploits the detection systems' reliance on predicting next-token probabilities. By shuffling token probabilities across models, it disguises the text's origins.

Key Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates that the token-ensemble attack significantly reduces detection accuracy of current state-of-the-art systems like Fast-DetectGPT.
- Two-token ensemble is the most effective, reducing AUROC from 0.99 to 0.44 on one dataset.
- Attack is more effective when fewer tokens are generated per step.
- Reveals vulnerabilities of detection systems against this sophisticated ensemble attack strategy. 
- Underscores need to advance detection technologies to counter evolving adversarial attacks.

In summary, the paper introduces a new token-ensemble attack that fools AI-generated text detectors by coordinating multiple language models. Experiments show this attack effectively lowers detection accuracy on state-of-the-art systems. The findings reveal limitations of current detection methods and the importance of developing more robust defenses.
