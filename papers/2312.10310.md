# [scBiGNN: Bilevel Graph Representation Learning for Cell Type   Classification from Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10310)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate cell type annotation from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is essential for understanding cellular heterogeneity and dynamics. 
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for automatic cell type classification, but existing methods do not sufficiently exploit both gene-gene and cell-cell relationships.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a bilevel graph representation learning framework called scBiGNN that integrates gene-level and cell-level structural information for cell type classification.

- It consists of two complementary GNN modules:
   - A gene-level GNN that builds on the gene-gene interaction graph and generates cell representations by aggregating expressions of related genes.
   - A cell-level GNN that constructs a cell-cell graph based on cell representations from the gene-level GNN and refines the representations by message passing between similar cells.

- To tackle scalability issues, the two GNNs are trained alternately via an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework to maximize the evidence lower bound and make the modules gradually enhance each other.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first bilevel framework to simultaneously model gene-gene and cell-cell relationships for cell type classification.
- Develops an EM-based training method to optimize the two GNN modules alternately so that they can scale and interact. 
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling structures at both biological levels.

In summary, the key innovation is the bilevel graph learning idea enabled by the EM-based training scheme, which advances the capability of GNNs for scRNA-seq analysis.
