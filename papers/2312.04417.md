# [Temporal Fairness in Multiwinner Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04417)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a unified framework for studying temporal fairness in multiwinner voting. The framework considers elections held over multiple timesteps, where either a single candidate or a committee is selected at each timestep. Key elements of the framework include the structure of outcomes, feasibility constraints, preference models (approval, ranked, cardinal; static or dynamic), observability of future preferences, sequentiality of timesteps, and solution concepts for evaluating fairness and representation across time (global, local, frequency-based). The paper consolidates connections to existing work on perpetual voting, fair scheduling, public decision-making, and sequential elections. Several open challenges and research directions are identified, including formalizing temporal extensions of representation concepts, incorporating expressiveness through temporal constraints on preferences, understanding computational implications of the temporal dimension, and expanding beyond multiwinner voting to temporal participatory budgeting. Overall, the paper sets foundations to facilitate principled study of an important and practically relevant topic.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a unified framework for studying temporal fairness in multiwinner voting, consolidates existing work, and identifies opportunities for future research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified framework for studying temporal fairness in multiwinner voting. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a general framework for temporal multiwinner voting that includes elements like outcomes, preferences, observability, sequentiality, and solution concepts. It discusses various options within each element and positions existing work with respect to these options.

- The paper consolidates different strands of research on multi-period voting, including perpetual voting, sequential committee elections, scheduling, and public decision-making. It draws connections between these bodies of work and situates them within the proposed unified framework. 

- The paper identifies gaps in the literature, outlines opportunities for future work, and puts forward a vision for studying temporal fairness in multiwinner voting in a more systematic way. This includes formally defining temporal extensions of representation concepts, investigating the impact of temporal constraints on preferences, understanding if time helps or hurts from a computational perspective, among others.

- The paper sets the groundwork and research agenda for a more coherent approach towards tackling conceptual and algorithmic challenges associated with multiwinner voting over time. It highlights the significant potential in this area which combines two very active research topics - multiwinner voting and temporal considerations.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a structure and future research directions to study multiwinner voting with temporal/dynamic elements in a principled manner.

The paper proposes a framework for studying temporal fairness in multiwinner voting, where elections are held repeatedly over multiple timesteps. It discusses various elements of this framework such as outcomes, preferences, observability, sequentiality, and solution concepts. Some key ideas explored are dynamic/evolving voter preferences over time, extending concepts like justified representation and proportionality to temporal settings, connections to scheduling and participatory budgeting problems, etc. The paper consolidates existing literature and identifies research gaps and challenges around temporal considerations in voting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a unified framework for studying temporal fairness in multiwinner voting. What are the key components of this framework and how do they capture the complexity of voting over time?

2. The paper discusses several options for the structure of outcomes at each timestep. What are the two main variants and what are some feasibility constraints that can be imposed on the outcome vector? 

3. The paper considers different types of ballots that can be used to elicit voters' preferences. What are the three main types discussed and what are their strengths and limitations? 

4. The paper makes a distinction between static and dynamic preferences. What is the difference and what are some examples provided of each type?

5. The paper talks about online and offline settings regarding the observability of future timesteps. What characterizes each of these settings and what existing works adopt them?

6. The paper argues sequentiality of the problem instance is an important element to consider. In what scenarios does order/contiguity over timesteps matter and what models in the literature capture this?

7. The paper categorizes solution concepts into three broad types - global, local, and frequency-based. Can you provide an example solution concept of each type and explain the difference in perspective?

8. One research direction suggested is the formalism of novel temporal solution concepts. What are some examples provided of how existing concepts can be extended and what new concepts can be defined? 

9. Another research direction is understanding if time makes solving certain problems easier or harder, computationally. What example is provided in the paper regarding this and why is it an interesting question to analyze further?

10. Beyond multiwinner voting, the paper suggests expanding the analysis to participatory budgeting settings. How are these settings more general and what challenges might this extension present?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Temporal Fairness in Multiwinner Voting":

Problem:
- Multiwinner voting is used to select committees in various real-world scenarios like parliamentary elections, product placements, etc. 
- Existing literature on multiwinner voting focuses on one-shot elections and does not capture temporal considerations that are important in many applications. For example, in repeated elections like those for AAAI's executive council, temporal fairness notions like representation over time are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a unifying framework to facilitate the principled study of temporal fairness in multiwinner voting. 
- The framework consists of: set of agents, set of candidates, set of time steps, agents' temporal preferences, feasibility constraints on outcomes, online/offline settings, sequentiality requirements, and solution concepts like global, local and frequency-based.

- The paper systematically analyzes design choices within each element of the framework, relates them to existing literature, and identifies research gaps. Some key aspects considered are:
    - Outcomes: Selecting single or multiple winners per time step, feasibility constraints on outcomes
    - Preferences: Approval vs ranked vs cardinal ballots, static vs dynamic preferences 
    - Observability: Online vs offline settings
    - Sequentiality: Ordering over time steps matter or not
    - Solution concepts: Global, local and frequency-based concepts

Main Contributions:
- Provides a unified view of the emerging work on multiwinner voting over time
- Systematically analyzes the design space and relates existing work to specific design choices
- Identifies several open questions around temporal solution concepts, impact of time on computation, connections to participatory budgeting
- Outlines challenges like formalizing temporal fairness notions, understanding whether time helps or hurts computationally
- Sets up a principled foundation to guide and stimulate future research on this important topic
