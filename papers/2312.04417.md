## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a unified framework for studying temporal fairness in multiwinner voting. The framework considers elections held over multiple timesteps, where either a single candidate or a committee is selected at each timestep. Key elements of the framework include the structure of outcomes, feasibility constraints, preference models (approval, ranked, cardinal; static or dynamic), observability of future preferences, sequentiality of timesteps, and solution concepts for evaluating fairness and representation across time (global, local, frequency-based). The paper consolidates connections to existing work on perpetual voting, fair scheduling, public decision-making, and sequential elections. Several open challenges and research directions are identified, including formalizing temporal extensions of representation concepts, incorporating expressiveness through temporal constraints on preferences, understanding computational implications of the temporal dimension, and expanding beyond multiwinner voting to temporal participatory budgeting. Overall, the paper sets foundations to facilitate principled study of an important and practically relevant topic.
