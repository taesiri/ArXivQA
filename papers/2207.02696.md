# [YOLOv7: Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for   real-time object detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we design a real-time object detection system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining efficient for edge devices?The key points are:- The paper proposes a new real-time object detection system called YOLOv7 that aims to push the state-of-the-art in speed and accuracy trade-offs. - The authors identify two key research directions that have emerged recently: model re-parameterization and dynamic label assignment. They propose new methods to address challenges arising from these directions.- The paper introduces the concept of "trainable bag-of-freebies" - modules and techniques that improve accuracy during training but do not increase inference cost. Several such methods are proposed.- To improve utilization of parameters and computations, the paper proposes "extend" and "compound scaling" techniques tailored for the YOLOv7 architecture.- Experiments demonstrate YOLOv7 achieves excellent speed-accuracy trade-offs compared to prior state-of-the-art real-time detectors, using only the COCO dataset for training without extra data.In summary, the central research question is how to design an object detector that pushes accuracy boundaries for real-time systems, using efficient model architecture and training strategies. The paper proposes a full system called YOLOv7 to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Proposes a new real-time object detection architecture called YOLOv7 and the corresponding model scaling method. The YOLOv7 model achieves state-of-the-art speed and accuracy trade-offs compared to prior YOLO versions and other real-time detectors.2. Identifies and addresses new challenges that arise from recent advances like model re-parameterization and dynamic label assignment. For model re-parameterization, they propose "planned re-parameterized convolution" to effectively apply re-parameterization to different network architectures. For dynamic label assignment with multiple output layers, they propose "coarse-to-fine lead guided label assignment". 3. Introduces additional training optimization methods called "trainable bag-of-freebies" that improve accuracy without increasing inference cost, including batch norm fusion, implicit knowledge transfer, and EMA model usage.4. Proposes "extend" and "compound scaling" methods to better utilize parameters and computation for real-time object detection models. 5. Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among real-time detectors across a range of model sizes and speeds. For example, YOLOv7-E6 achieves 56.8% AP at 36 FPS on a V100 GPU, surpassing prior arts like YOLOR, YOLOX, YOLOv5, etc.In summary, the key contribution is developing YOLOv7, a new state-of-the-art real-time object detector, along with innovations in architecture design, training techniques, and model scaling methods. The techniques help improve accuracy and efficiency for real-time detection.
