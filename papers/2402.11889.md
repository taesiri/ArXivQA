# [ROSE Doesn't Do That: Boosting the Safety of Instruction-Tuned Large   Language Models with Reverse Prompt Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11889)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Large language models (LLMs) tuned with human instructions have shown great capabilities, but often lack safety. Current methods to improve LLM safety require substantial training efforts like high-quality safety data and expensive compute resources. There is a need for more efficient ways to directly enhance the safety of existing instruction-tuned LLMs without additional training.  

Proposed Method (\textsc{Rose}): The paper proposes a simple yet effective method called \textsc{Rose} (Reverse prOmpt contraStive dEcoding) that boosts LLM safety at inference time without retraining. It works by using carefully designed "reverse prompts" to elicit unsafe model responses, and then suppresses this undesired output to encourage safer generations.

Key Idea: \textsc{Rose} is based on two key observations - (1) model generations are greatly influenced by the given prompt (2) contrasting undesired output can guide better responses. By inducing and suppressing negative responses, it strengthens the focus on safe outputs.

Experiments: Extensive experiments on multiple safety tasks and 5 instruction-tuned LLMs validate \textsc{Rose}. It provides consistent and significant safety gains of up to +13.8%, without compromising general capability. Analyses also reveal its working mechanisms.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an efficient inference-time approach \textsc{Rose} to directly improve safety of existing LLMs without retraining
- Empirically demonstrates its effectiveness and universality across diverse models and benchmarks
- Provides insights into its working and guidelines on when and where to use it

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in boosting LLM safety in a simple yet effective manner without additional training.
