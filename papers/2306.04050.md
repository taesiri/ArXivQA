# [LLMZip: Lossless Text Compression using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It provides new estimates of the entropy rate (upper bound) for English text using the large language model LLaMA-7B as a predictor. - The entropy rate estimate is significantly lower than previous estimates in the literature.- It proposes a text compression algorithm that combines the predictions from LLaMA-7B with a lossless compression scheme like arithmetic coding. - Preliminary results show this LLaMA-based compression algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art text compression methods like BSC, ZPAQ and paq8h.So in summary, the main research question is - what is the entropy rate of English text, and can large language models like LLaMA-7B enable better text compression through more accurate predictions? The key hypothesis appears to be that LLaMA-7B can predict English text more accurately than previous methods, leading to lower entropy rate estimates and improved text compression performance when combined with a lossless coding scheme.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Providing new estimates of an asymptotic upper bound on the entropy of English using the large language model LLaMA-7B as a predictor for the next token given a window of past tokens. The estimated upper bound is significantly smaller than previous estimates. 2. Proposing an algorithm for lossless compression of English text that combines the predictions from LLaMA-7B with a lossless compression scheme like arithmetic coding. 3. Reporting preliminary results from experiments suggesting this LLaMA-7B based compression scheme outperforms state-of-the-art text compression algorithms like BSC, ZPAQ, and paq8h.4. Estimating the entropy rate of English to be below 0.8 bits/character based on experiments with LLaMA-7B, which is lower than previous estimates.5. Demonstrating the performance of LLaMA-7B based compression improves with increasing context size/memory length of the model.In summary, the main contribution is leveraging the power of large language models like LLaMA-7B to provide improved estimates of the entropy rate of English and develop better lossless text compression algorithms. The results highlight the usefulness of large language models for prediction and compression tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new text compression method called LLMZip that uses a large language model as a predictor to estimate upper bounds on English text entropy, achieving better compression ratios than current state-of-the-art algorithms.
