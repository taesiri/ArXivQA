# [LLMZip: Lossless Text Compression using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It provides new estimates of the entropy rate (upper bound) for English text using the large language model LLaMA-7B as a predictor. - The entropy rate estimate is significantly lower than previous estimates in the literature.- It proposes a text compression algorithm that combines the predictions from LLaMA-7B with a lossless compression scheme like arithmetic coding. - Preliminary results show this LLaMA-based compression algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art text compression methods like BSC, ZPAQ and paq8h.So in summary, the main research question is - what is the entropy rate of English text, and can large language models like LLaMA-7B enable better text compression through more accurate predictions? The key hypothesis appears to be that LLaMA-7B can predict English text more accurately than previous methods, leading to lower entropy rate estimates and improved text compression performance when combined with a lossless coding scheme.
