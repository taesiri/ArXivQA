# [Synthetic Data (Almost) from Scratch: Generalized Instruction Tuning for   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13064)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) rely on seed examples or existing datasets, which limits the diversity and coverage of generated instructions. 
- Seed examples require substantial human effort and expertise to create. Existing datasets cover a limited set of domains/tasks.
- There is a need for a general, scalable method to generate high-quality instruction tuning data covering diverse capabilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose GLAN, a novel method to generate synthetic instruction data systematically across all disciplines. 
- GLAN first builds a taxonomy of human knowledge/capabilities by decomposing them into fields, subfields and disciplines semi-automatically using LLMs and human verification.
- For each discipline, GLAN generates subjects, designs syllabus (with class sessions & key concepts) for each subject using LLMs.
- It then randomly combines class sessions and key concepts to generate diverse homework questions and answers as instruction pairs at scale.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a general, scalable framework GLAN to generate synthetic instruction data covering diverse capabilities almost from scratch using a taxonomy and LLMs.
- Generates 10M high-quality instruction pairs without using any task-specific training data.
- Shows models tuned on this data (e.g. Mistral) improve significantly on mathematical reasoning, coding, academic exams, logical reasoning tasks.
- Introduces new benchmark GLAN-Test to assess generalization across 126 disciplines.
- Framework is customizable allowing easy addition of new fields/skills by adding nodes to taxonomy.
