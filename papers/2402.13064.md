# [Synthetic Data (Almost) from Scratch: Generalized Instruction Tuning for   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13064)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) rely on seed examples or existing datasets, which limits the diversity and coverage of generated instructions. 
- Seed examples require substantial human effort and expertise to create. Existing datasets cover a limited set of domains/tasks.
- There is a need for a general, scalable method to generate high-quality instruction tuning data covering diverse capabilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose GLAN, a novel method to generate synthetic instruction data systematically across all disciplines. 
- GLAN first builds a taxonomy of human knowledge/capabilities by decomposing them into fields, subfields and disciplines semi-automatically using LLMs and human verification.
- For each discipline, GLAN generates subjects, designs syllabus (with class sessions & key concepts) for each subject using LLMs.
- It then randomly combines class sessions and key concepts to generate diverse homework questions and answers as instruction pairs at scale.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a general, scalable framework GLAN to generate synthetic instruction data covering diverse capabilities almost from scratch using a taxonomy and LLMs.
- Generates 10M high-quality instruction pairs without using any task-specific training data.
- Shows models tuned on this data (e.g. Mistral) improve significantly on mathematical reasoning, coding, academic exams, logical reasoning tasks.
- Introduces new benchmark GLAN-Test to assess generalization across 126 disciplines.
- Framework is customizable allowing easy addition of new fields/skills by adding nodes to taxonomy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Generalized Instruction Tuning (GLAN), a scalable method to generate synthetic instruction data across disciplines by utilizing a taxonomy of human knowledge and capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing GLAN, a general and scalable method for generating synthetic instruction data to tune large language models. Specifically:

- GLAN builds a taxonomy of human knowledge and capabilities by decomposing them into fields, subfields, and disciplines. This taxonomy guides the systematic and broad coverage of generated instructions.

- GLAN generates a comprehensive list of subjects for each discipline, designs a detailed syllabus for every subject, and extracts key concepts from the syllabus. This mirrors how human education systems are structured.

- By sampling and recombining class sessions and key concepts, GLAN produces diverse and fine-grained instructions at scale using LLMs like GPT-4.

- Experiments show GLAN helps models like Mistral improve on diverse tasks like mathematical reasoning, coding, academic exams, and logical reasoning without using any task-specific training data.

- GLAN is general, scalable, and customizable. New fields/skills can be added by incorporating nodes into the taxonomy. The modular taxonomy allows expanding specific disciplines independently.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel method GLAN to generate high-quality, scalable, and general synthetic instruction data for tuning LLMs by utilizing a taxonomy of human knowledge.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the GLAN method proposed in this paper:

1. The taxonomy of human knowledge and capabilities forms the foundation for GLAN's instruction data generation. How was this taxonomy constructed and verified for coverage and extensibility? What measures were taken to ensure it can be easily expanded in the future?

2. The subject and syllabus generators rely heavily on prompting GPT-4. What prompt engineering strategies were used to elicit high-quality and structured outputs from GPT-4? How was the balance between conciseness and details in prompts determined? 

3. The class sessions and key concepts extracted from the generated syllabi are critical for composing diverse homework questions. What were the technical details and rationale behind the separate extraction step instead of directly generating questions from syllabi texts?

4. Two strategies are mentioned for sampling class sessions and key concepts to create homework questions - one focusing on single session and one combining concepts from two sessions. What heuristic guided the design of these strategies? How do they complement each other in improving coverage?

5. The decontamination step removes training examples overlapping with test/validation sets of evaluated benchmarks. What techniques were used to efficiently search and match the massive instruction data against multiple benchmark datasets? 

6. The results on academic exam benchmarks reveal an interesting finding - significant gains on ARC but smaller improvements on MMLU. What underlying reasons may account for this phenomenon?

7. On the GLAN test set, gains over baseline models vary noticeably across different disciplines and fields. What hypotheses can be formed regarding when and why GLAN tends to outperform other models the most?

8. The taxonomy provides a framework conducive for incremental expansion. If new capabilities need to be added in future LLM versions, what would be the steps and effort required under the GLAN framework?

9. The current focus is generating question-answer style instruction data. How can the methodology be extended to produce other data modalities such as dialogues or long-form documents? Would the taxonomy still be relevant?

10. The gains of GLAN seem significantly below fully trained LLMs like GPT-4 on some generalization benchmarks. Are there any known limitations of synthetic data compared to real-world human data? What ameliorations can be considered?
