# [A Neural-network Enhanced Video Coding Framework beyond ECM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Video data is rapidly increasing, posing challenges for efficient video compression. Current standards like HEVC, VVC, and AVS3 follow the hybrid coding framework which has limitations. There is growing interest in integrating deep learning methods into video codecs to enhance performance beyond traditional coding.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a hybrid video coding framework by enhancing the Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) codec. The main contributions are:

1) Introduce an unsymmetric quaternary tree (UQT) partitioning structure that asymmetrically splits blocks to capture local content variations, especially in larger blocks. This provides flexibility beyond quadtree or multi-type tree partitions.

2) Integrate a CNN-based in-loop filter with adaptive parameter selection to further reduce coding artifacts. It takes prediction signals, boundary strength, QP as input to enhance reconstruction quality.

3) Activate the block importance mapping in ECM which sets CTU QP based on temporal layer similarity to minimize distortion across frames. 

4) Seamlessly integrate the above tools into ECM framework to demonstrate the potential of fusing learning-based methods with hybrid coding.

Results:
Extensive experiments on JVET dataset show average BD-rate savings of 6.26%, 13.33%, 12.33% for Y, U, V components over ECM codec under random access configuration. Tests on CLIC 2024 dataset further validate performance, achieving 25.889 dB PSNR under 0.05 Mbps bitrate.

The paper shows substantial compression gains from the proposed hybrid framework, highlighting the promise of integrating deep learning into video coding standards.
