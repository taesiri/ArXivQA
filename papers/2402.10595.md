# [Compact and De-biased Negative Instance Embedding for Multi-Instance   Learning on Whole-Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10595)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classifying whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to lack of patch-level annotations and high variability between slides (e.g. due to different staining protocols). 
- Multiple instance learning (MIL) methods have been proposed to classify WSIs using slide-level labels only, but they do not utilize the fact that all patches from a normal/negative slide are normal.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a semi-supervised approach called Compact and Debiased Negative Embedding (CDNE) to improve existing MIL models for WSI classification. 
- Key ideas:
   - Synchronize the center of negative instance embeddings from all negative slides to reduce inter-slide variability/bias.
   - Learn a compact representation for negative instances to capture common factors of variation.
- A loss function is introduced to minimize the standard deviation of negative instance embeddings across slides.
- The method can be combined with any MIL algorithm and handles both binary and multi-class classification.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on Camelyon16 and TCGA lung cancer datasets with several MIL methods.
- CDNE consistently improves performance of different MIL algorithms, outperforming other semi-supervised approaches. 
- Analysis shows that CDNE successfully reduces inter-slide bias and leads to more distinct representations between positive and negative slides.

Key Contributions:
- Novel semi-supervised approach to utilize implicit negative patch labels in WSIs to improve MIL methods.
- Compact negative embedding to reduce stain variation and capture common factors within normal patches.
- Demonstrated consistent and significant performance gains over state-of-the-art MIL techniques.
- Orthogonal method that can enhance any existing MIL algorithm.

In summary, the key novelty is in exploiting the implicit negative labels in normal slides to create a debiased, compact negative representation that improves attention and classification accuracy. Evaluations confirm efficacy across datasets and MIL algorithms.
