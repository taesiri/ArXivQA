# [DiffDreamer: Towards Consistent Unsupervised Single-view Scene   Extrapolation with Conditional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12131)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we perform consistent and realistic single-view scene extrapolation using diffusion models?

In particular, the authors aim to develop an unsupervised framework that can synthesize novel views depicting a long camera trajectory by "flying" into a single image, while only training on collections of unrelated internet images. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Image-conditioned diffusion models can effectively perform long-range scene extrapolation while preserving consistency better than prior GAN-based methods.

2) By modifying the sampling behavior at inference time, diffusion models can be conditioned on multiple past and future frames to improve consistency despite training on single images.

3) Techniques like anchored conditioning on distant frames and virtual lookahead conditioning can help maintain both local and global consistency for scene extrapolation using diffusion models.

So in summary, the main research question is whether diffusion models can enable consistent and realistic single-view scene extrapolation in an unsupervised manner, which prior GAN approaches have struggled with. The key hypotheses focus on how diffusion models can be adapted to this task through customized training and inference procedures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing DiffDreamer, a novel unsupervised framework based on conditional diffusion models for consistent scene extrapolation from a single image. Scene extrapolation refers to generating novel views by virtually "flying" into a given image.

- Formulating consistent scene extrapolation as learning a conditional diffusion model on only internet-collected images without pose information. The model is trained to iteratively refine projected RGBD frames and inpaint missing regions.

- Introducing two key techniques - anchored conditioning and lookahead conditioning - to improve long-term consistency during sampling from the diffusion model at inference time. These help preserve both local and global consistency.

- Demonstrating that image-conditioned diffusion models can effectively perform long-range scene extrapolation while preserving consistency significantly better than prior GAN-based methods. The consistency could allow fusing the outputs as a 3D model (e.g. NeRF).

- Showing a fully automated novel view synthesis pipeline using conditional diffusion models trained only on single image collections, without multi-view supervision.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing DiffDreamer, a diffusion-based framework for consistent single-view scene extrapolation that outperforms prior GAN methods in consistency while requiring less supervision. This serves as a starting point for diffusion-based novel view synthesis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of scene extrapolation and novel view synthesis:

- The key novelty is using a diffusion model for scene extrapolation in a consistent way. Most prior work uses GANs and autoregressive models, which often suffer from inconsistency between frames. Diffusion models provide a different approach that allows enforcing consistency during inference.

- It tackles long-range scene extrapolation from a single image, which is very challenging. Many multi-view novel view synthesis methods require posed image sets, while single image methods usually only handle small camera motions. This pushes the boundaries on long-range synthesis.

- The method is fully unsupervised, trained only on unlabeled landscape photos. Many scene extrapolation techniques require some pose supervision or ground truth 3D geometry. Relying only on in-the-wild photos is a notable capability.

- The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on scene extrapolation metrics compared to recent GAN methods like InfNat and InfNat-0. The consistency is particularly improved based on the 3D consistency metrics.

- Limitations include slower runtime due to diffusion sampling and limited diversity when going beyond the input image's content. The conditioning mechanisms enforce consistency but canreduce variation.

Overall, I think the key comparison is that this paper demonstrates diffusion models can achieve strong results on highly challenging scene extrapolation problems where consistency is critical. It opens up a new direction for this task by moving beyond GANs. The unsupervised training is also notable. The results show measurable improvements in consistency while generating compelling long-range views.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper does not explicitly suggest specific future research directions. However, based on the content and conclusions, some potential future research directions could include:

- Improving the consistency and diversity of long-range scene extrapolation. The authors note limitations in preserving diversity when generating sequences far beyond the content of the input image. Extending the model with vector conditioning (e.g. CLIP embeddings) could help address this.

- Increasing the resolution and detail of the generated images and scenes. The current method operates on low resolution 128x128 images. Scaling to higher resolutions could enable more detailed and realistic scene synthesis.

- Adapting the approach to more complex scenes like urban environments or indoor spaces. The current method focuses on natural outdoor landscapes. Applying conditional diffusion models for urban and indoor scene extrapolation introduces new challenges.

- Speeding up the inference time. The diffusion model sampling currently limits real-time application. Leveraging advances in efficient diffusion model sampling could make the approach more practical.

- Combining the consistency of diffusion models with the diversity of GANs. Exploring ways to benefit from the strengths of both generative modeling approaches could further improve scene extrapolation.

- Extending the method to video generation. Conditioning the model on past and future frames could potentially enable consistent video generation rather than just still image sequences.

In summary, the key future directions relate to improving the consistency, diversity, scale, scope, speed, and temporal modeling of the scene extrapolation task using conditional diffusion models. The authors lay a strong foundation that can be built upon in many exciting ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes DiffDreamer, a novel framework for consistent single-view scene extrapolation using conditional diffusion models. Scene extrapolation refers to the task of generating novel views by virtually "flying" into a single input image. This is challenging as it requires jointly solving an inpainting and 3D refinement problem with only a single view. 

The key idea is to train an image-conditional diffusion model on internet photos to refine and inpaint corrupted views obtained by warping previous views. At inference, stochastic conditioning is used to refine the view based on the previous view, a further anchored view, and a virtual future view. This allows long-term consistency while only seeing individual images during training.

Experiments on landscape photos demonstrate DiffDreamer can generate 50+ frame fly-through videos with significantly better consistency than GAN methods like Infnat-0. The stochastic sampling process enables consistency despite the limited supervision. The results showcase the potential of diffusion models for novel view synthesis and scene extrapolation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces DiffDreamer, a novel framework for consistent single-view scene extrapolation using conditional diffusion models. Scene extrapolation refers to the task of generating novel views by virtually "flying" into a single input image. This is an extremely challenging problem as it requires performing joint inpainting and 3D refinement to hallucinate missing content while maintaining consistency across frames. Most prior work uses GANs in an auto-regressive feedforward manner, leading to inconsistent results. DiffDreamer instead formulates the problem as learning an image-conditioned diffusion model to iteratively refine and inpaint projected RGBD frames. At training time, the model is trained to denoise corrupted RGBD images created by warping ground truth data. At inference, anchored sampling and a lookahead mechanism are proposed to enhance long-term consistency despite only seeing single images during training. Specifically, anchored sampling stochastically conditions the diffusion model on a warped further frame to provide global consistency, while lookahead conditioning makes use of an easy to generate future view.

Experiments demonstrate that DiffDreamer can generate 50+ frame fly-through videos with significantly better consistency than GAN methods like InfNat-0. The stochastic refinement process enables converging to a harmonious set of frames. Quantitative results on standard datasets demonstrate comparable or superior image quality metrics to prior work. DiffDreamer represents an promising application of diffusion models to perform scene-level novel view synthesis in a consistent manner despite limited training data. The consistency has useful applications for creating 3D content and VR experiences.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes DiffDreamer, a novel framework for consistent single-view scene extrapolation using conditional diffusion models. The key idea is to train an image-conditioned diffusion model to perform image inpainting and refinement on a corrupted image obtained by warping a previous image. At inference time, instead of strictly conditioning on the warped previous image, they propose two strategies - anchored conditioning, where the model is conditioned on a far-away warped frame to encourage global consistency, and virtual lookahead conditioning, where the model is conditioned on a virtual future frame to aid detail preservation. By performing stochastic conditioning on multiple frames, the model can generate a sequence of novel views with higher consistency compared to prior GAN-based approaches while only being trained on single internet images. The diffusion model refinement process allows jointly optimizing for local detail generation and global structure.
