# [DiffDreamer: Towards Consistent Unsupervised Single-view Scene   Extrapolation with Conditional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12131)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we perform consistent and realistic single-view scene extrapolation using diffusion models?

In particular, the authors aim to develop an unsupervised framework that can synthesize novel views depicting a long camera trajectory by "flying" into a single image, while only training on collections of unrelated internet images. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Image-conditioned diffusion models can effectively perform long-range scene extrapolation while preserving consistency better than prior GAN-based methods.

2) By modifying the sampling behavior at inference time, diffusion models can be conditioned on multiple past and future frames to improve consistency despite training on single images.

3) Techniques like anchored conditioning on distant frames and virtual lookahead conditioning can help maintain both local and global consistency for scene extrapolation using diffusion models.

So in summary, the main research question is whether diffusion models can enable consistent and realistic single-view scene extrapolation in an unsupervised manner, which prior GAN approaches have struggled with. The key hypotheses focus on how diffusion models can be adapted to this task through customized training and inference procedures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing DiffDreamer, a novel unsupervised framework based on conditional diffusion models for consistent scene extrapolation from a single image. Scene extrapolation refers to generating novel views by virtually "flying" into a given image.

- Formulating consistent scene extrapolation as learning a conditional diffusion model on only internet-collected images without pose information. The model is trained to iteratively refine projected RGBD frames and inpaint missing regions.

- Introducing two key techniques - anchored conditioning and lookahead conditioning - to improve long-term consistency during sampling from the diffusion model at inference time. These help preserve both local and global consistency.

- Demonstrating that image-conditioned diffusion models can effectively perform long-range scene extrapolation while preserving consistency significantly better than prior GAN-based methods. The consistency could allow fusing the outputs as a 3D model (e.g. NeRF).

- Showing a fully automated novel view synthesis pipeline using conditional diffusion models trained only on single image collections, without multi-view supervision.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing DiffDreamer, a diffusion-based framework for consistent single-view scene extrapolation that outperforms prior GAN methods in consistency while requiring less supervision. This serves as a starting point for diffusion-based novel view synthesis.
