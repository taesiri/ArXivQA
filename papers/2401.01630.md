# [A Cybersecurity Risk Analysis Framework for Systems with Artificial   Intelligence Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The introduction of regulations like the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework require a better understanding and implementation of risk analysis approaches to evaluate systems with AI components. However, current approaches remain qualitative and lack rigor.

- AI systems introduce new cybersecurity challenges regarding impacts, assets, controls and targeted attacks. For example, impacts now also include issues around safety, fairness, bias and transparency. Attackers can also exploit AI components in attacks or use AI to automate attacks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides an AI cybersecurity risk analysis framework to address these challenges. It structures an organization into blocks across levels, with potential attack flows between blocks. 

- Algorithms are provided to simulate attack propagation through the system to assess impacts. Risk indicators like loss distributions and probabilities can then be estimated. An approach to risk management is also outlined to select optimal security controls and cyber insurance.

- The framework incorporates novel aspects introduced by AI like assessing protections of AI system components using security evaluation curves. Adversarial risk analysis is also integrated to model targeted attacks against the system.

Contributions:
- Comprehensive cyber risk analysis framework tailored for AI systems covering impacts, assets, controls and targeted attacks.

- Algorithms for attack simulation, risk assessment and risk management selection.

- Inclusion of specific AI issues like security evaluation curves for AI protections and adversarial risk analysis for targeted attacks.

- Illustrative case study on automated driving systems security and discussion on using the framework to determine risk levels under regulations.

In summary, the paper provides a rigorous methodology and algorithms for analyzing cyber risks in AI systems to support risk management and compliance needs. The framework incorporates key aspects particular to AI.
