# [Anatomy-guided fiber trajectory distribution estimation for cranial   nerves tractography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18856)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately identifying cranial nerves (CNs) using diffusion MRI tractography is challenging due to the complex skull base environment and fiber geometry, which can lead to erroneous trajectories and missing connections. 
- Existing methods that generate point-to-point streamlines are prone to early interruption and failure to reach endpoints during CN tracing.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a novel CN identification framework with anatomy-guided fiber trajectory distribution (FTD) that incorporates anatomical shape priors into the tracing process.
- It defines a tract-based FTD function using a higher-order streamline differential equation to directly reconstruct CN trajectories from region to region. 
- Anatomical priors are built by estimating CN orientations from obtained centerlines and used as constraints in an optimization model to estimate the FTD function.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces a tract-based FTD function to directly identify CNs and reduce false positive streams.
- Incorporates anatomical shape priors as constraints into the FTD function optimization.  
- Demonstrates improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing key CNs on public HCP and clinical datasets.
- Reduces erroneous trajectories and shows better spatial congruence to fiber geometry.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel CN tractography method using an anatomy-guided fiber trajectory distribution framework that incorporates anatomical knowledge to help trace CN paths accurately. Experiments validate improved reconstruction of complex CN trajectories compared to existing techniques.
