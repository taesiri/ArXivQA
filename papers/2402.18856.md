## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately identifying cranial nerves (CNs) using diffusion MRI tractography is challenging due to the complex skull base environment and fiber geometry, which can lead to erroneous trajectories and missing connections. 
- Existing methods that generate point-to-point streamlines are prone to early interruption and failure to reach endpoints during CN tracing.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes a novel CN identification framework with anatomy-guided fiber trajectory distribution (FTD) that incorporates anatomical shape priors into the tracing process.
- It defines a tract-based FTD function using a higher-order streamline differential equation to directly reconstruct CN trajectories from region to region. 
- Anatomical priors are built by estimating CN orientations from obtained centerlines and used as constraints in an optimization model to estimate the FTD function.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces a tract-based FTD function to directly identify CNs and reduce false positive streams.
- Incorporates anatomical shape priors as constraints into the FTD function optimization.  
- Demonstrates improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing key CNs on public HCP and clinical datasets.
- Reduces erroneous trajectories and shows better spatial congruence to fiber geometry.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel CN tractography method using an anatomy-guided fiber trajectory distribution framework that incorporates anatomical knowledge to help trace CN paths accurately. Experiments validate improved reconstruction of complex CN trajectories compared to existing techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel cranial nerves identification framework that incorporates anatomical shape prior knowledge to estimate fiber trajectory distributions and reduce false positive fibers in diffusion MRI tractography.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel cranial nerves (CNs) identification framework with anatomy-guided fiber trajectory distribution (FTD). Specifically:

1) It defines a tract-based FTD function using higher-order streamline differential equations to directly characterize the fiber trajectory distribution of CNs from the tract level. 

2) It builds anatomical shape priors by estimating CNs orientation from obtained CNs centerlines. This prior is used as an anatomical constraint in the optimization model to estimate the FTD function.

3) The proposed method incorporates anatomical knowledge during CNs tracing to build diffusion tensor vector fields. Experiments on HCP and clinical datasets demonstrate it can reduce false positive fibers and produce CN reconstructions that better match known anatomy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key innovation is using an anatomy-guided FTD framework to identify CNs in a more anatomically consistent manner by modeling the overall trajectory distribution instead of point-to-point streamlines.
