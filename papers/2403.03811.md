# [Incentivized Learning in Principal-Agent Bandit Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03811)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies a repeated principal-agent bandit game, where a principal interacts with an environment through an agent. The principal and agent have misaligned objectives, but only the agent can choose actions. The principal can influence the agent's actions by providing incentives/rewards that get added to the agent's utility. The goal of the principal is to learn an optimal incentive policy over time to maximize her total utility. This extends bandit problems to account for incentives and misaligned objectives.

Solution:
The paper proposes an algorithm called Incentivized Principal-Agent Algorithm (IPA) with two main steps:

1. Estimate minimal incentives needed to make the agent select any desired action, using binary search. This is done separately for each action.

2. Use the upper estimates of incentives from step 1 and feed them to a bandit algorithm like UCB. The bandit algorithm recommends actions and IPA provides incentives for those actions to influence the agent. This allows the principal to minimize her regret and learn the best actions.

The key insight is to decouple the problem of learning agent incentives from learning the principal's own rewards.

Contributions:

- Proposes IPA algorithm that achieves near optimal instance-dependent and distribution-free regret bounds for multi-armed bandits. Matches fundamental limits.

- Extends IPA to linear contextual bandits, handling non-stationary actions and incentives. Achieves Õ(d√T) regret which nearly matches context-free lower bounds.

- First algorithm for incentivized learning in contextual bandits and provides tight problem-dependent guarantees.

- Validates IPA experimentally and shows significant gains over prior art.

The work provides a principled framework for learning in principal-agent bandits and tight regret guarantees even as the problem setting is extended to incorporate complications like contexts and misaligned incentives.
