# [Detection of out-of-distribution samples using binary neuron activation   patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14268)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples using binary neuron activation patterns (NAPs) extracted from hidden layers of deep neural networks. 

The key hypothesis is that the binary NAPs contain useful information about whether a sample comes from the distribution seen during training, and can be used to accurately identify OOD inputs. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that the Hamming distance between the binary NAPs of a test sample and training samples can indicate if the test sample is OOD or not.

The paper proposes a novel NAP-based method to extract binary activation patterns from both fully connected and convolutional layers of neural networks. It hypothesizes that comparing these binary NAPs to patterns collected during training allows measuring the model's predictive uncertainty and detecting OOD inputs.

The central research questions are:

1) Can binary NAPs extracted from hidden layers be effectively used for OOD detection? 

2) How should convolutional layer activations be pooled and binarized to obtain useful NAPs?

3) How should NAP-based distances from multiple layers be combined for optimal OOD detection?

4) Does the proposed NAP method outperform current state-of-the-art approaches for OOD detection?

The paper aims to answer these questions through extensive experiments on image classification models and datasets. Overall, it hypothesizes and shows that the proposed NAP approach provides an effective way to leverage hidden layer activations for OOD detection that outperforms existing methods.
