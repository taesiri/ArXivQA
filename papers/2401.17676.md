# [Observer-based Controller Design for Oscillation Damping of a Novel   Suspended Underactuated Aerial Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the issue of oscillations in cable-suspended aerial platforms used for aerial manipulation tasks. Such platforms have advantages like lower energy use and ability to mount heavier manipulators compared to regular aerial vehicles. However, the pendulum motion caused by the suspension cables needs to be controlled. Existing solutions utilize fully actuated platforms with 8 rotors or rely on external motion capture systems, which have limitations.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two novel underactuated designs for the aerial platform - a planar-thrust design with 6 rotors and a minimal-actuated design with 4 rotors. Compared to an omnidirectional platform, these designs require fewer actuators while still being able to exert the required forces/moments to damp oscillations. 

The spherical double pendulum dynamics of the platform are modeled. An extended Kalman filter is designed to estimate the state (joint angles and velocities) using only onboard IMU measurements. 

Two controllers are developed - an optimal state feedback LQR controller to stabilize the joint space dynamics, and a PD+ controller to control position and orientation in task space.

The proposed underactuated platforms are evaluated in simulations and experiments using the LQR and PD+ controllers.

Main Contributions:

- Novel planar-thrust and minimal-actuated underactuated designs for a suspended aerial manipulator platform, which are more energy-efficient and require fewer actuators than existing platforms.

- State estimator using EKF to provide estimated states for control using only onboard sensors, without reliance on external motion capture systems.

- LQR and PD+ control schemes designed and implemented to damp oscillations of the double pendulum dynamics.

- Detailed numerical simulations and real-world experiments that validate the effectiveness of the proposed system and control approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes energy-efficient novel underactuated suspended aerial platforms using fewer actuators while still successfully damping oscillations, designs controllers for stabilizing the platforms, and validates the approach through simulations and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two novel underactuated designs for a suspended aerial platform:

1) A planar-thrust platform with six rotors that can only exert thrust in the plane of its base. This platform has a 3D wrench space (translational forces along x and y axes, and moment about the z axis).

2) A minimal-actuated platform with only four rotors, which is the minimum number required to achieve the same 3D wrench space as the planar-thrust design. 

The paper shows through simulations and experiments that these underactuated platforms are more energy-efficient and require fewer actuators than a fully omnidirectional design, while still being able to successfully damp oscillations of the spherical double pendulum system used to model the suspended aerial platform.

The paper proposes novel underactuated designs for a suspended aerial platform, including a planar-thrust and a minimal-actuated configuration. These platforms are modeled as a spherical double pendulum and controlled to damp oscillations. Key methods used include an extended Kalman filter for state estimation, an LQR optimal state feedback controller, and a PD+ task space controller. The underactuated platforms are shown to be more energy-efficient than an omnidirectional baseline. The goal is to enable aerial manipulation applications using the proposed suspended platforms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes two novel underactuated platform designs - a planar-thrust and a minimal-actuated one. How do these platforms achieve full controllability despite being underactuated? What are the tradeoffs compared to a fully actuated omnidirectional platform?

2) An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used for state estimation. Why was a continuous-discrete EKF chosen over a regular discrete-time EKF? How does the intermittent measurement updating work in this scheme? 

3) The measurements used for the EKF are velocities and orientations from the flight controller unit. Why were these states chosen to ensure observability? What role does observability play in the design of a state estimator?

4) Two controllers are proposed - an optimal state feedback LQR controller and a PD+ task space controller. Why is controlling in joint space with LQR advantageous compared to a task space approach for this application?

5) How is the redundancy in task space handled for the underactuated platforms with the PD+ controller? Explain the role of the null space and corresponding null space forces.  

6) For the PD+ controller, how are the desired closed-loop dynamics and stability achieved? What is the significance of the various terms in the control law?

7) The paper evaluates the energy efficiency of the platforms. How is this analysis performed? What causes the underactuated platforms to be more efficient than the omnidirectional one?

8) Why does the second spherical joint show higher frequency oscillations compared to the first joint? How do the controllers account for these two modes?

9) What causes the slight mismatch between simulations and experiments especially for the high frequency oscillations? How can the experimental platform be improved to achieve better match?

10) How can the concept of underactuation be extended for an aerial manipulator? What challenges need to be addressed compared to platforms without a manipulator?
