# [Soft Self-Consistency Improves Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate multiple candidate solutions to improve performance over greedy decoding, a technique known as "sample and select". 
- A popular approach is self-consistency (SC), which samples multiple solutions via chain-of-thought prompting and selects the majority vote.  
- However, SC runs into issues in interactive domains like bash program generation, online shopping, and text games, where the action space is very large. Identical actions are unlikely to be sampled multiple times, causing voting to fail.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose Soft Self-Consistency (Soft-SC), which relaxes the hard voting criterion of SC into a continuous score based on token probabilities from the LLM.
- For each sampled action, Soft-SC aggregates the probabilities of each token into a score using min, mean or product. The highest scoring action is selected.
- An adaptive variant stops sampling more actions when a confidence threshold is reached based on minimum token probabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Soft-SC outperforms SC for the same number of samples, with gains of 1.3-6.6% on bash, shopping and text games. 
- It exhibits better sample efficiency than SC, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer samples.
- It continues providing gains as model size increases, allowing smaller LMs with Soft-SC to match larger LMs with SC.
- It can score outputs from black box models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to give 4% gains over SC.
- Calibration is not needed for good Soft-SC performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Soft Self-Consistency, a method that improves language model agents by softly scoring sampled solutions instead of relying on strict majority voting like standard self-consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Soft Self-Consistency (\method), a continuous relaxation of voting-based sample and select methods like self-consistency (SC). \method replaces the discontinuous exact-match scoring used in SC with a continuous score based on model likelihoods. This allows \method to effectively select good solutions even when there is no clear majority vote, which the authors show is an issue for SC in interactive domains with large action spaces. The key findings are:

- \method outperforms SC with the same number of samples, with higher success rates on tasks like writing Bash programs, online shopping, and household games. 

- \method exhibits better sample efficiency than SC, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer samples.

- \method scales better with model size than SC.

- \method can be used to score and select outputs from black-box models, improving over SC.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting \method as an improved sample and select approach over prior work like SC for interactive domains with large action spaces. \method improves both efficiency and overall task performance.

The paper introduces a method called "Soft Self-Consistency" (Soft-SC) which improves on existing "sample and select" methods like self-consistency (SC) for selecting generations from large language models. It uses likelihood scores instead of majority voting used by SC. Experiments show Soft-SC outperforms SC on interactive domains like Bash, WebShop, and ALFWorld, while also being more sample efficient. An adaptive version of Soft-SC is also introduced. So the key ideas focus around softening self-consistency for LLMs agents using likelihood based scoring.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes Soft Self-Consistency (\method{}) as an alternative to Self-Consistency (SC) for scoring multiple language model samples. How does \method{} computationally differ from SC, and why does this make it more suitable for interactive domains with sparse action spaces?

2. \method{} replaces the discontinuous scoring of SC with a continuous score based on model likelihoods. Explain the intuition behind using model likelihoods to score actions and how this enables selection even when actions are sparsely distributed across samples. 

3. The paper shows \method{} has better sample efficiency than SC, achieving comparable or higher performance with fewer samples. Analyze the differences in how \method{} and SC determine when sufficient samples have been drawn, and why \method{} is more sample efficient.  

4. Adaptive \method{} stops sampling based on a likelihood score threshold rather than estimating vote convergence as in Adaptive Consistency. Discuss the motivation behind using a calibrated likelihood threshold and how it improves efficiency over Adaptive Consistency.

5. The authors find that \method{} outperforms SC on black-box models like GPT-4 despite using likelihoods from a smaller scorer model. Explain how \method{} is able to effectively rescore generations from black-box models and discuss any limitations. 

6. The paper examines whether model calibration is necessary for good \method{} performance. Summarize the results, discuss why calibration may not correlate with \method{} success, and suggest any additional calibration metrics to investigate.  

7. Compare how \method{} and SC are applied in multi-step domains like WebShop versus ALFWorld in terms of what actions are scored and selected at each step. Explain why the differences enable greater gains for \method{} over SC in WebShop.

8. The paper identifies computational expense as a limitation of sample-and-select methods like SC and \method{}. Propose modifications to \method{} to reduce its cost, such as approximations of the likelihood calculations or more aggressive early stopping.

9. The authors demonstrate \method{} for an LLM agent interacting with an external environment. Discuss how \method{} could be extended to multi-agent settings where multiple LLM agents interact, such as debates. 

10. Beyond the studied domains, identify and justify 2-3 interactive domains that you hypothesize would be suitable test beds for \method{}, discussing factors like action space diversity.
