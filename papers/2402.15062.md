# [Gotcha! Don't trick me with unanswerable questions! Self-aligning Large   Language Models for Responding to Unknown Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to be overconfident when answering questions, even providing incorrect or hallucinated answers to questions that do not have definitive answers (unknown questions).
- Existing approaches focus on detecting or refusing to answer unknown questions, but do not provide explanations or appropriate responses.

Proposed Solution - Self-Aligned Method:  
- Uses the LLM itself in a self-alignment framework to improve its capabilities in responding appropriately to unknown questions.
- Has 3 main steps:
   1) Class-aware self-augmentation: Uses seed data and known QA pairs to generate a large training dataset of unknown questions and possible responses.
   2) Disparity-driven self-curation: Filters the generated data using the base LLM to measure disparity from original known QA pairs.
   3) Supervised fine-tuning: Fine-tunes the base LLM on the curated dataset.
- Can be applied iteratively to continually improve quality of training data.

Main Contributions:
- Studies the problem of providing open-ended responses with explanations to unknown questions, instead of just detecting or refusing to answer them.  
- Proposes a novel, scalable self-alignment method to use the LLM itself to improve its response-ability to different types of unknown questions.
- Shows superior performance over baselines in unknown question detection, classification and open-ended response generation tasks.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage the base LLM's own capabilities in a loop to self-improve its effectiveness in responding appropriately when encountering questions without definitive answers. The self-alignment framework avoids the need for external labeled data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. The authors first study the problem of unknown questions in the form of open-ended response generation, rather than simply refusing to answer them. 

2. They propose a novel and scalable self-alignment approach to utilize large language models (LLMs) to improve their own capabilities in identifying the unanswerability of unknown questions and responding to unknown questions with explanations.

3. Experimental results on two datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines in terms of three types of task formulations: unknown question detection, unknown question classification, and open-ended response generation.

In summary, the key contribution is the self-alignment method to enhance LLMs' abilities to appropriately respond to different types of unknown questions that do not have definitive answers, with both refusal to answer and explanations.

The paper focuses on improving large language models' ability to respond appropriately to questions that do not have definitive answers (unknown or unanswerable questions). It proposes a self-alignment method to generate data and fine-tune the model to identify and explain why such questions are unanswerable, rather than providing incorrect hallucinated answers. Key aspects include using the model to self-augment data, curate the data by evaluating disparity from answerable versions, and iteratively refine the model.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel self-alignment method to improve the model's capability of responding to unknown questions. Can you elaborate more on why self-alignment is an effective technique for this task compared to other methods?

2. The self-alignment method utilizes the model itself for data augmentation and curation. What are the advantages and potential risks of using the model's own outputs for enhancing itself? 

3. The paper adopts disparity-driven self-curation to select high-quality augmented data. Can you explain more on why measuring disparity from known QA pairs is better than using principles or rules to score the quality?

4. Iterative self-alignment is adopted in the paper. How many iterations are appropriate and what factors determine the stopping criteria? Is there a risk of model degradation with excessive iterations?  

5. The model improvements seem significant in the human evaluation but less so in automatic evaluation. What could explain this discrepancy and how can automatic metrics be improved to better capture model capabilities on this task?

6. How can the self-alignment method proposed be adapted for other types of unknown questions not covered in the paper? What augmentations would be needed for new unknown question types?

7. The method relies on seed data containing known-unknown question pairs. How does the quantity and quality of seed data impact overall model performance? Is there a minimum viable amount of seed data needed?

8. How robust is the self-alignment method to noise and errors in the known QA data used for augmentation? Are certain QA datasets more appropriate sources than others?

9. For practical deployment, how can self-alignment be efficiently conducted on very large models? Are there optimizations inprompting, curation thresholds or training that can improve scalability?

10. The evaluations are conducted on open-sourced LLMs. To what extent are the improvements from self-alignment expected to transfer to proprietary models like ChatGPT? What additional experiments could be useful to test for transferability?
