# [Gotcha! Don't trick me with unanswerable questions! Self-aligning Large   Language Models for Responding to Unknown Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15062)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to be overconfident when answering questions, even providing incorrect or hallucinated answers to questions that do not have definitive answers (unknown questions).
- Existing approaches focus on detecting or refusing to answer unknown questions, but do not provide explanations or appropriate responses.

Proposed Solution - Self-Aligned Method:  
- Uses the LLM itself in a self-alignment framework to improve its capabilities in responding appropriately to unknown questions.
- Has 3 main steps:
   1) Class-aware self-augmentation: Uses seed data and known QA pairs to generate a large training dataset of unknown questions and possible responses.
   2) Disparity-driven self-curation: Filters the generated data using the base LLM to measure disparity from original known QA pairs.
   3) Supervised fine-tuning: Fine-tunes the base LLM on the curated dataset.
- Can be applied iteratively to continually improve quality of training data.

Main Contributions:
- Studies the problem of providing open-ended responses with explanations to unknown questions, instead of just detecting or refusing to answer them.  
- Proposes a novel, scalable self-alignment method to use the LLM itself to improve its response-ability to different types of unknown questions.
- Shows superior performance over baselines in unknown question detection, classification and open-ended response generation tasks.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage the base LLM's own capabilities in a loop to self-improve its effectiveness in responding appropriately when encountering questions without definitive answers. The self-alignment framework avoids the need for external labeled data.
