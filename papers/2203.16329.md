# [Parameter-efficient Model Adaptation for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16329)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper formatting instructions, there does not appear to be a specific research question or hypothesis being addressed. The document provides formatting guidelines and instructions for preparing a paper to be submitted to AAAI for publication. Some key elements I noticed:

- It specifies the LaTeX style files and document class to use (e.g. \usepackage{aaai23}, \documentclass[letterpaper]{article}) 

- It lists formatting requirements for the title, authors, affiliations, abstract, keywords, and body sections. For example, the title must be in mixed case and the abstract should be a single paragraph between 150-200 words.

- It provides guidelines on formatting elements like figures, tables, algorithms, citations, and the bibliography. 

- It specifies font sizes, margin sizes, and prohibits certain LaTeX packages and commands. 

- There are instructions on preparing supplementary material and acknowledgments.

So in summary, this appears to be a set of formatting instructions for authors rather than presenting a research question or hypothesis. The goal seems to be providing guidelines to prepare manuscripts for publication in AAAI venues by standardizing the formatting. The instructions cover both style and technical requirements for elements that are common in research papers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. They conduct the first comprehensive comparison of efficient model adaptation methods for vision transformers (ViTs) on image classification tasks. 

2. They propose a novel parameter-efficient model adaptation framework called Kronecker Adaptation (KAdaptation). This method first selects submodules of ViT by measuring their local intrinsic dimensions, and then projects the selected modules into a low-dimensional subspace via Kronecker product decomposition for efficient training.

3. They benchmark several baseline methods as well as state-of-the-art efficient adaptation methods from NLP on image classification datasets. The results demonstrate their proposed KAdaptation method achieves the best tradeoff between accuracy and parameter efficiency.

4. They formulate the efficient model adaptation problem as subspace training and provide general guidelines for adapting large pretrained vision models. The two key aspects are choosing the right submodules via local intrinsic dimensions and performing efficient subspace projection like their proposed KAdaptation.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new parameter-efficient adaptation framework for ViTs, as well as providing empirical analysis and general guidelines for efficient adaptation of large vision models. The comprehensive benchmarking of methods is also a useful contribution.
