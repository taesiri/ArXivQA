# [Leveraging AI-derived Data for Carbon Accounting: Information Extraction   from Alternative Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Carbon accounting is critical for emissions tracking and reduction goals, but faces challenges around accuracy, timeliness and granularity of data. 
- Conventional methods like manuals and reporting are inadequate to comprehensively map emissions across complex, dynamic supply chains and industries.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage AI, specifically NLP and computer vision, to unlock alternative data sources and enhance carbon accounting.
- Apply NLP techniques like entity recognition and relationship extraction to unstructured text data (e.g. financial filings, shipping records) to extract emissions details across supply chains. 
- Integrate the NLP-powered supply chain emissions data with an e-liability knowledge graph framework to enable emissions liability management.

Methodology:
- Use GPT-3 model in few-shot learning mode on earnings calls transcripts to extract supply chain transaction details (buyer, supplier, item).
- Apply spaCy NER model to filter and select related sentences from transcripts.
- Visualize sample bill of lading data to demonstrate potential for gleaning supply chain insights.

Results:
- GPT-3 model achieved near perfect precision, recall and F1 for extracting buyers from sentences. Also strong performance for suppliers and items (F1 ~0.98).
- Demonstrates feasibility and promise of using NLP techniques to parse text data for supply chain emissions tracking.

Main Contributions:
- Motivated need for alternative, more diverse data sources and applications of AI/NLP for robust carbon accounting. 
- Provided methodology and case study demonstrating the efficacy of NLP for extracting supply chain emissions data from alternative text sources.
- Discussed integration of such techniques into a knowledge graph framework for enterprise and industry-level emissions liability management.
