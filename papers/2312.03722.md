# [Leveraging AI-derived Data for Carbon Accounting: Information Extraction   from Alternative Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Carbon accounting is critical for emissions tracking and reduction goals, but faces challenges around accuracy, timeliness and granularity of data. 
- Conventional methods like manuals and reporting are inadequate to comprehensively map emissions across complex, dynamic supply chains and industries.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage AI, specifically NLP and computer vision, to unlock alternative data sources and enhance carbon accounting.
- Apply NLP techniques like entity recognition and relationship extraction to unstructured text data (e.g. financial filings, shipping records) to extract emissions details across supply chains. 
- Integrate the NLP-powered supply chain emissions data with an e-liability knowledge graph framework to enable emissions liability management.

Methodology:
- Use GPT-3 model in few-shot learning mode on earnings calls transcripts to extract supply chain transaction details (buyer, supplier, item).
- Apply spaCy NER model to filter and select related sentences from transcripts.
- Visualize sample bill of lading data to demonstrate potential for gleaning supply chain insights.

Results:
- GPT-3 model achieved near perfect precision, recall and F1 for extracting buyers from sentences. Also strong performance for suppliers and items (F1 ~0.98).
- Demonstrates feasibility and promise of using NLP techniques to parse text data for supply chain emissions tracking.

Main Contributions:
- Motivated need for alternative, more diverse data sources and applications of AI/NLP for robust carbon accounting. 
- Provided methodology and case study demonstrating the efficacy of NLP for extracting supply chain emissions data from alternative text sources.
- Discussed integration of such techniques into a knowledge graph framework for enterprise and industry-level emissions liability management.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using natural language processing and alternative data sources like earnings calls and shipping records to extract supply chain details and construct e-liability knowledge graphs that can enhance carbon accounting across industries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating how advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to extract supply chain and emissions data from alternative unstructured data sources like earnings calls transcripts and shipping records. Specifically, the paper shows how transformer-based large language models like GPT-3 can achieve high accuracy in identifying key entities (e.g. buyers, suppliers, items) and relationships from textual data. This capability to leverage alternative data sources can facilitate the construction of detailed "e-liability knowledge graphs" to track carbon emissions across complex industrial supply chains. Such knowledge graphs in turn have significant potential utility for emissions verification, industrial benchmarking, research, and policy making. So in summary, the key innovation is using cutting-edge NLP to unlock alternative data sources to improve carbon accounting practices.

The paper discusses using AI and NLP techniques to extract emissions-related data from alternative unstructured data sources like financial transcripts and shipping records. It then shows how this information can be used to construct knowledge graphs that map emissions liabilities (e-liabilities) across supply chains to enhance carbon accounting procedures. The key ideas focus on improving transparency and accuracy of carbon accounting through advanced data analytics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using OpenAI's GPT API for few-shot learning on an NER task. What are some of the advantages and limitations of using GPT models for named entity recognition compared to traditional NER models? How could the methodology be improved?

2. The paper uses earnings calls transcripts and shipping data (bill of ladings) as alternative data sources for supply chain mapping. What other potential alternative data sources could be leveraged for this purpose and what would be the challenges in using them? 

3. The knowledge graph constructed from the shipping data uses randomly sampled emissions factors to estimate product emissions. How can this methodology be improved to get more accurate emissions estimates? What LCA databases could be used instead and what are the challenges in accessing them?

4. The paper demonstrates the methodology on a small sample of earnings calls transcripts. What are some of the challenges that would need to be addressed before this can be scaled up to use full earnings transcripts at an industry level?

5. The knowledge graph in Figure 1 shows inherited emissions for a single company (Samsung) based on shipping data. How can this graph be expanded to capture the full supply chain network and emissions flows across multiple companies? 

6. What kind of post-processing would need to be done on the extracted entities (buyer, supplier, item) from the NLP model before using them to construct the knowledge graph? How can the precision be further improved?

7. How can the textual data from earnings calls be effectively combined with the structured shipping data to create an integrated knowledge graph? What additional information would need to be added to reconcile entities across the two data sources?

8. The paper focuses only on emissions tracking through supply chains. How can the knowledge graph approach be extended to also capture carbon sequestration across sectors? What additional data would be needed?

9. What mechanisms can be incorporated to keep the knowledge graph updated in real-time as new data comes in from earnings calls and shipping datasets? What are some scalability considerations?

10. The paper discusses how the knowledge graph can be used for verification, benchmarking and policy analysis. Can you propose some additional novel use cases or applications where such an emissions tracking knowledge graph could provide value?
