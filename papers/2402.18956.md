# [WWW: A Unified Framework for Explaining What, Where and Why of Neural   Networks by Interpretation of Neuron Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Despite recent advances, neural networks still face the "black box" problem where their decision-making processes are unclear and obscure to humans. This hinders adoption in critical domains and raises concerns about reliability and safety. Laws now require neural networks to provide explanations in human-understandable terms. However, prior works on interpretability have limitations in jointly explaining the "what", "where", and "why" behind neural network decisions.  

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a novel framework called WWW that provides unified explanations for the "what", "where" and "why" of neural network decisions. 

"What": WWW utilizes an adaptive selection method with adaptive cosine similarity and thresholding to effectively identify concepts represented by each neuron. This explains what each neuron represents.

"Where": WWW combines neuron activation maps with Shapley values to generate localized concept maps and heatmaps highlighting influential regions in the input for each concept. This shows where in the input each concept is present.

"Why": WWW introduces class-wise Shapley values to select important neurons for model predictions on a class. By comparing class and sample explanations, WWW reveals why the model makes certain predictions and decisions.

Key Contributions:
- Unified solution jointly explaining "what", "where" and "why" unlike prior works focusing on one or two
- Introduces adaptive selection for superior concept discovery compared to prior arts
- Localized explanations from global interpretations using novel combination of activation maps and Shapley values 
- Method for predicting uncertainty via heatmap similarity analysis
- Plug-and-play solution adaptable to CNNs and Vision Transformers

The experiments demonstrate WWW's superior performance on both quantitative and qualitative metrics. By enhancing model transparency and human-understandability, WWW contributes to trustworthy and reliable AI.
