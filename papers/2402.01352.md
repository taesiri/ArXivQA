# [Describing Images $\textit{Fast and Slow}$: Quantifying and Predicting   the Variation in Human Signals during Visuo-Linguistic Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01352)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Humans show ample variation in behavior when describing images, as seen in speech onsets, first words uttered (starting points), full descriptions, and eye movements. 
- This variation likely stems in part from properties of the images themselves.
- However, current pretrained multimodal models do not receive information about such human behavioral signals and variation during training.

Approach:
- The authors use the Dutch Image Description and Eye-tracking (DIDEC) corpus which contains spoken descriptions and eye-tracking data for images.
- They preprocess the data to extract speech onsets, starting points, full descriptions, and gaze patterns.
- They propose metrics to quantify the variation in these signals across participants for each image.
- They find significant correlations between the variations, indicating an underlying image-based cause. 
- They hypothesize that if images contribute to the variation, then similar images should elicit similar amounts of variation in human signals.
- They test if pretrained encoders like CLIP and ViT capture information about the variation by predicting the variation scores using a similarity-based approach.

Key Findings:
- Moderate correlations found between variation in speech onsets, starting points, descriptions, and eye movements.
- Image representations from CLIP and ViT are weakly-to-moderately predictive of the variation scores.
- Signals more closely related to the models' training objectives (e.g. descriptions for CLIP) are better predicted.

Main Contributions:
- First study to quantify and reveal correlations between variation in multiple human signals during visuo-linguistic tasks using the DIDEC dataset.
- Demonstration that pretrained encoders capture meaningful signals about human visual and linguistic variation, but rather weakly, suggesting room for improvement.
- Proposing metrics to measure variation in starting points, descriptions, gaze patterns.
- Directing attention to incorporating human signals and modeling their variation when training multimodal models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates the variation in human signals like speech onsets and gaze patterns when describing images, finding correlations between variations across signals, and shows that pretrained vision models can weakly capture some but not all aspects of this variation, suggesting they lack complete knowledge of what drives complexity and diversity in human visuo-linguistic processing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors quantified the variation in human signals like speech onsets, starting points of descriptions, full descriptions, and gaze patterns during the process of describing images. They found significant correlations between the variation in these signals across images.

2) Using a similarity-based prediction method without any training, the authors showed that pretrained vision encoders like CLIP and ViT can capture the variation in human signals to a limited extent. Signals more inherent to the models' training objectives (e.g. description variation for CLIP) are better captured compared to more external signals (e.g. speech onsets).

3) The paper highlights the gap between human and machine processing of visual stimuli. It motivates making models more knowledgeable about the intricacies of human behavioral signals by incorporating such signals during model training/fine-tuning. This could help in generating more human-aligned responses.

In summary, the key contributions are quantifying and revealing correlations in human signal variation, probing pretrained models' capabilities in capturing this variation, and motivating the use of such human signals to improve multimodal models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Visuo-linguistic processes - The paper examines the relationship between visual perception and language production when humans describe images. This includes cross-modal processes between vision and language.

- Variation in human signals - The paper analyzes variation in speech onsets, starting points of descriptions, full descriptions, and gaze patterns across different images and speakers. It quantifies this variation.

- Correlations between variations - The paper finds significant correlations between the variation in different human signals like speech onsets, linguistic variation, and gaze variation when describing images.

- Image features and variation - The paper hypothesizes image features contribute to the observed variation in human signals. It investigates whether pretrained image encoders can capture information about this variation.

- Similarity-based prediction - A prediction method based on similarity of image embeddings is used to predict variation in signals for new images. This probes the encoders' capabilities.

- Pretrained encoders - Encoders from CLIP, ViT, and a random CLIP version are analyzed in terms of encoding variation in human visuo-linguistic signals based on image contents.

So in summary, key terms cover visuo-linguistic processes, quantifying variation in human signals, analyzing correlations between them, predicting variation using similarity of pretrained image embeddings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes metrics to quantify variation in speech onsets, starting points, full descriptions, and gaze patterns. Could you expand more on how these metrics were designed and computed? What were some of the key considerations?

2. The paper finds correlations between the different types of variation metrics computed. What could be some potential reasons driving these correlations? To what extent could image features explain these correlations?

3. The similarity-based prediction method retrieves the k most similar images and predicts variation scores based on a weighted average. How was k determined in the experiments? How sensitive are the results to the choice of k? 

4. For predicting variation in full descriptions, CLIP encoding slightly outperforms ViT. What differences between CLIP and ViT could potentially explain this result? Does the text encoder in CLIP provide an advantage?

5. For predicting starting points, a smaller choice of k works better for CLIP and ViT. Why would very similar images result in worse performance for predicting starting points?

6. The paper argues variation in signals like speech onsets is more "external" to CLIP's training objective. Do you think a fine-tuning approach could better capture such external signals compared to the similarity-based prediction method?

7. The dataset contains 3 different splits/lists with different images and participants per split. Were the correlations in variation consistent across the splits? If not, how might the splits have differed?  

8. What other human signals, beyond those analyzed, could provide further insight into variation in visuo-linguistic processes when describing images?

9. The images contain complex real-world scenes. How might performance change if simpler synthetic images were used? Would we expect more or less variation in human signals?

10. If this analysis was reproduced on a different image description dataset, containing different images, objects and types of scenes, how might the correlations in variation metrics change? Why?
