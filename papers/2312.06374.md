# [UstanceBR: a multimodal language resource for stance prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06374)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces UstanceBR, a new multimodal corpus for stance prediction in Brazilian Portuguese tweets. The corpus contains over 86,000 labeled stances towards six polarized target topics, as well as accompanying user timelines and network data. The targets were carefully selected to represent contemporary issues of interest in Brazil across politics, health, and institutions. The paper describes the rigorous data collection and annotation process, which aimed to capture both explicit and more subtle implicit stances. Inter-annotator agreement was substantially high for most targets. In addition to the stance data, the corpus includes rich contextual data - over 34 million tweets in full user timelines as well as network information on user friends, followers and mentions. The paper demonstrates sample usage of the corpus for in-domain stance prediction using text and network features as well as preliminary cross-target zero-shot prediction. Results show that network features can outperform text for stance prediction in this domain. The new corpus has considerable potential to enable further research on target-based and user-level stance detection as well as the role of homophily and polarization in a multimodal prediction context for Brazilian Portuguese.
