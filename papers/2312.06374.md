# [UstanceBR: a multimodal language resource for stance prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06374)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces UstanceBR, a new multimodal corpus for stance prediction in Brazilian Portuguese tweets. The corpus contains over 86,000 labeled stances towards six polarized target topics, as well as accompanying user timelines and network data. The targets were carefully selected to represent contemporary issues of interest in Brazil across politics, health, and institutions. The paper describes the rigorous data collection and annotation process, which aimed to capture both explicit and more subtle implicit stances. Inter-annotator agreement was substantially high for most targets. In addition to the stance data, the corpus includes rich contextual data - over 34 million tweets in full user timelines as well as network information on user friends, followers and mentions. The paper demonstrates sample usage of the corpus for in-domain stance prediction using text and network features as well as preliminary cross-target zero-shot prediction. Results show that network features can outperform text for stance prediction in this domain. The new corpus has considerable potential to enable further research on target-based and user-level stance detection as well as the role of homophily and polarization in a multimodal prediction context for Brazilian Portuguese.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces UstanceBR, a novel multimodal corpus of over 86,000 labeled stances and accompanying user timelines and network data for stance prediction in Brazilian Portuguese Twitter.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Large corpus of explicit and implicit stances towards polarised targets in the Portuguese Twitter domain. The stance corpus contains 86.8k labelled tweets.

2. Accompanying timeline text data and network information for both user-level and multimodal stance prediction. This includes 34.8 million tweets in the timelines corpus and network data with 4.5 million friend/follower identifiers. 

3. Reference results for in-domain stance prediction based on text and network data, as well as zero-shot stance prediction from text. Baseline experiments are provided using the corpus.

In summary, the key contribution is a new multimodal corpus for stance detection in Brazilian Portuguese, comprising textual stance data as well as rich user timelines and network information. The paper also establishes baseline results on this corpus for future research.

The paper introduces a new multimodal corpus called "UstanceBR" for stance prediction in Brazilian Portuguese tweets. It contains over 86,000 labelled stances towards six polarized target topics. The corpus also includes accompanying user timelines and network data like friends, followers, and mentions. The paper shows usage examples of the data for in-domain and zero-shot stance prediction using text- and network-based models. So those are some of the central keywords and concepts covered in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new multimodal corpus called UstanceBR. What are the key components of this corpus and what kind of data does each component contain?

2. The paper conducts both in-domain and zero-shot stance prediction experiments. Can you explain the difference between in-domain and zero-shot stance prediction? What are the motivations for studying zero-shot stance prediction?  

3. The in-domain experiments compare text-based and network-based models. What specific text and network features are used in these models? Why does the network-based approach perform better for most targets?

4. The zero-shot experiments attempt to predict stances for a target using models trained on other targets. What are some key factors that could influence the performance of zero-shot prediction? How could performance be improved?

5. The paper argues that UstanceBR can support studies on user-level stance prediction. How might the timeline and network data be utilized for this task? What kinds of models could be developed?

6. One unique aspect of UstanceBR is the inclusion of both explicit and implicit stances. What is the difference between explicit and implicit stances? How might this impact computational modeling?  

7. The paper identifies some limitations of the corpus such as imbalance between classes for some targets. How might these limitations be addressed in future work?

8. The corpus focuses on polarized target pairs across three domains. Do you think this specific choice of targets limits the generalizability of models trained on this data? Why or why not?

9. The paper hints at the possibility of using data augmentation methods for semi-supervised learning. What kinds of augmentation could be applied and how might it help? What risks are associated with augmentation?

10. Beyond the text classification tasks presented, what other potential uses cases exist for the UstanceBR corpus in areas like argument mining, abusive language detection, etc.?
