# [UstanceBR: a multimodal language resource for stance prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stance prediction is the task of determining if a text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral stance towards a given target. It is an important capability for natural language understanding.
- Most existing stance prediction resources focus on English and specific target topics unfamiliar to Portuguese speakers. 
- Few resources provide user-level stance labels or accompanying network data to support multimodal stance prediction.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce UstanceBR, a new multimodal corpus for stance prediction towards 6 targets in Brazilian Portuguese tweets.  
- It contains 86.8k labelled stance tweets, 34.8 million accompanying user timeline tweets, and network data on 4.5 million friends/followers.
- The corpus supports in-domain stance prediction and cross-target zero-shot experiments using text content and social network features.

Key Contributions:
- Novel large-scale corpus for multimodal stance prediction in an under-served language - Brazilian Portuguese.
- Accompanying user timelines and detailed network data enable future research directions.  
- Results for in-domain stance prediction with text and network features demonstrate strong predictive capabilities.
- Initial cross-target zero-shot experiments highlight challenges and opportunities for future work in transfer learning.
- Publicly released corpus and baseline results to support advancement of stance prediction for Portuguese.

In summary, the paper introduces a uniquely comprehensive multimodal corpus to advance stance prediction capabilities for Brazilian Portuguese through a combination of textual and network analytic techniques. The scale and detail of this new resource enables a multitude of future research avenues.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces UstanceBR, a novel multimodal corpus of over 86,000 labeled stances and accompanying user timelines and network data for stance prediction in Brazilian Portuguese tweets across 6 polarizing targets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Large corpus of explicit and implicit stances towards polarised targets in the Portuguese Twitter domain.

2. Accompanying timeline text data and network information for both user-level and multimodal stance prediction. 

3. Reference results for in-domain stance prediction based on text and network data, and zero-shot stance prediction from text.

In summary, the paper introduces a new multimodal corpus for stance detection called UstanceBR, which contains over 86k labelled stance tweets in Brazilian Portuguese along with associated user timelines and network data. It provides baseline experimental results on this corpus for in-domain and zero-shot stance prediction using the textual and network information.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, the following keywords or key terms appear to be associated with the paper: 

- Corpora
- stance prediction
- social media
- Portuguese NLP

To summarize, the key aspects from this paper include:

- This work introduces UstanceBR, a novel multimodal corpus in Brazilian Portuguese from Twitter for target-based stance prediction
- The corpus contains over 86k labeled stances towards selected topics (e.g. politicians, medications, institutions) as well as extensive network information about the users
- The paper describes the corpus and data, as well as examples of usage for in-domain and zero-shot stance prediction based on text and network features
- This provides initial baseline results for future studies on stance detection using this new corpus

So in essence, it introduces and evaluates a new Portuguese language resource/dataset for stance prediction from social media and network data, with a focus on Twitter.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using both text features and network features for stance prediction. How exactly are the network features, such as lists of friends, followers, and mentions, incorporated into the stance prediction models? What machine learning approaches are used?

2. The paper evaluates both in-domain and zero-shot stance prediction. What are the key differences in the methodology between these two types of stance prediction? How do the results compare?

3. The annotation protocol mentions taking a "broad perspective" on what constitutes a stance, including implicit stances. Can you elaborate on the guidelines given to annotators to identify implicit stances? How might this impact model performance? 

4. Table 2 shows there is lower inter-annotator agreement for the Lula and Church targets. What are some possible reasons for this? How might disagreement on implicit stances play a role?

5. For zero-shot stance prediction, why does using the "best" source domain lead to better performance than using the most closely related target? What does this suggest about the role of semantic similarity in transfer learning for this task?

6. The paper mentions the possibility of using semi-supervised methods like data augmentation to create larger labeled stance datasets. What existing techniques could be leveraged for data augmentation for stance prediction? What are some challenges?

7. What kinds of user-level stance prediction models could make use of the provided user timelines data? What advantages might user-level models have over instance-level models?

8. Could the multimodal network data help enable cross-target zero-shot stance prediction? What kind of methodology would be needed to effectively utilize this data?

9. The paper focuses solely on Twitter data. How might stance prediction on other platforms like Reddit or long-form texts differ? Would new annotation guidelines or models be needed?

10. For real-world deployment, what are some challenges of stance prediction on stream data rather than static collections? Could the models used here work in stream settings or would adaptations be needed?
