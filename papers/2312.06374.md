# [UstanceBR: a multimodal language resource for stance prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stance prediction is the task of determining if a text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral stance towards a given target. It is an important capability for natural language understanding.
- Most existing stance prediction resources focus on English and specific target topics unfamiliar to Portuguese speakers. 
- Few resources provide user-level stance labels or accompanying network data to support multimodal stance prediction.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce UstanceBR, a new multimodal corpus for stance prediction towards 6 targets in Brazilian Portuguese tweets.  
- It contains 86.8k labelled stance tweets, 34.8 million accompanying user timeline tweets, and network data on 4.5 million friends/followers.
- The corpus supports in-domain stance prediction and cross-target zero-shot experiments using text content and social network features.

Key Contributions:
- Novel large-scale corpus for multimodal stance prediction in an under-served language - Brazilian Portuguese.
- Accompanying user timelines and detailed network data enable future research directions.  
- Results for in-domain stance prediction with text and network features demonstrate strong predictive capabilities.
- Initial cross-target zero-shot experiments highlight challenges and opportunities for future work in transfer learning.
- Publicly released corpus and baseline results to support advancement of stance prediction for Portuguese.

In summary, the paper introduces a uniquely comprehensive multimodal corpus to advance stance prediction capabilities for Brazilian Portuguese through a combination of textual and network analytic techniques. The scale and detail of this new resource enables a multitude of future research avenues.
