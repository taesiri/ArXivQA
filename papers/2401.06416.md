# [Mission: Impossible Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06416)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chomsky and others have claimed that large language models (LLMs) can learn both possible and impossible human languages equally well. This claim implies LLMs cannot inform our understanding of human language learning. 
- However, there is little experimental evidence supporting this claim. There is also no clear definition or examples of "impossible" languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a set of "impossible" languages that lie on a continuum of complexity. These include shuffled, reversed, and verb-marked versions of English.
- They train GPT-2 models on these languages and test their ability to learn them compared to regular English. Evaluations include perplexity, targeted surprisal comparisons, and causal interventions.

Key Findings:
- Models trained on impossible languages achieve higher perplexities and learn less efficiently than those trained on regular English.
- Models are more surprised by ungrammatical constructions when trained on regular English compared to impossible grammars. 
- Causal analysis shows models develop human-like solutions for non-human grammar rules.

Main Contributions:  
- First extensive experimental evidence challenging claims that LLMs learn all languages equally well.
- Framework to test LLMs on impossible languages to probe language learning capacities.
- Results show GPT-2 struggles with impossible languages, prefers natural grammars, and develops interpretable solutions.
- Opens discussions on using LLMs to study language universals and the boundary of possible languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models can learn a set of synthetic "impossible languages" as well as natural language by training GPT-2 models on perturbed versions of an English dataset, finding through perplexity evaluations, targeted surprisal comparisons, and causal analyses that the models struggle more with the impossible languages, challenging claims that they learn all patterns equally well.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an empirical investigation of whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 can learn both possible and impossible languages equally well. The authors create a set of synthetic "impossible languages" that systematically alter English through word shuffling, reversal, and grammar rules based on counting words. They train GPT-2 models on these languages and find that the models struggle more to learn the impossible languages compared to unaltered English. Specifically, they show through perplexity evaluations, targeted surprisal comparisons, and causal interventions that:

1) Models trained on possible languages learn more efficiently, evident from lower perplexities achieved faster. 

2) Models prefer natural grammar rules, demonstrated by higher surprisal for ungrammatical constructions in possible languages.

3) Models develop human-like solutions to non-human grammar patterns, tracking agreement through relevant token positions.

Overall, the results challenge claims that LLMs cannot distinguish between possible and impossible languages. The paper opens up a research direction of testing LLMs on a variety of impossible languages to better understand their capacities as models of language learning and typology.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Impossible languages - The paper synthesizes a set of "impossible languages" by systematically altering English data with unnatural word orders and grammar rules. These languages are used to test whether language models can learn patterns that are impossible for humans.

- Information locality - The property that statistical correlations in text tend to be short-range. The paper argues this arises in humans due to real-time processing constraints.

- Surprisal - A metric measuring how unexpected a word is given the preceding context. Used to compare language models' expectations of grammatical vs ungrammatical constructions.  

- Causal abstraction - An interpretability method to identify causal mechanisms in neural models. The paper uses this to analyze how models learn the count-based verb grammar rules.

- Universal Grammar - The hypothesis that humans have innate constraints or biases that determine possible grammatical patterns. The paper discusses using language models, which lack strong built-in linguistic priors, to investigate questions about necessities for language learning.

- Chomsky hierarchy - A hierarchy of formal languages based on their expressive capacity. Results showing neural language models cannot learn languages high in the hierarchy contrasts with their strong performance on natural language tasks.

So in summary, key terms cover synthesized impossible languages, information-theoretic properties, evaluation metrics, interpretability techniques, linguistic theories, and formal language theory.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a set of "impossible languages" that are used to test the abilities of language models. What factors went into the design and construction of these synthetic impossible languages? How did the authors attempt to span the space of impossible languages?

2. The impossible languages are evaluated on language models with standard architectures and training procedures. Would the results depend significantly on model architecture or size? How about the training hyperparameters or pretraining approaches? 

3. The paper finds that language models struggle more to learn the impossible languages compared to English. Does this conclusively show that language models can distinguish possible from impossible languages as a whole? What further experiments could help strengthen or clarify this argument?  

4. For the count-based verb marking languages, the paper shows that while models prefer natural grammar rules, they are still able to learn the artificial rules to some extent. What mechanisms allow them to acquire these rules? Do the learned mechanisms differ fundamentally from hypothesized human solutions?

5. Causal abstraction analysis is used to examine the internal representations language models form when learning the counting rules. How does this methodology allow us to "open the black box" of neural models? What are its limitations? Are there other analysis techniques that could provide additional insights?

6. Information locality is discussed as an inductive bias that could explain why models find natural languages more learnable. What empirical evidence exists for this hypothesis? How exactly might incremental processing relate to learning syntactic structures?

7. The paper focuses on evaluating language model capabilities on English text. Would the continuum of possible/impossible languages hold for other languages? What considerations would be necessary for multilingual assessments?  

8. What role does the size and nature of the training data play in determining the learnability of impossible languages? Could changes to the pretraining regime make impossible languages more learnable?

9. The probing experiments show minimal differences in latent syntactic knowledge across models. Is this evidence that the impossible language perturbations were not strong enough? Or are probes an insufficient method for assessing syntactic competence?

10. The paper argues that language models can inform questions about necessary innate constraints for language acquisition. What exactly is the relevance of language models to debates about poverty of stimulus arguments? What additional comparative experiments could help address these long-standing arguments?
