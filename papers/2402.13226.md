# [NeRF Solves Undersampled MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Undersampled MRI aims to reconstruct high-quality MR images from limited k-space measurements to reduce scan time. But undersampling causes aliasing artifacts in standard reconstruction methods.
- Existing data-driven deep learning methods require large paired datasets and lack adaptiveness to new scans. Obtaining such datasets is difficult for some applications like fetal MRI.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage implicit neural representation and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) concept to model MRI as an image rendering task from sparse projections.
- Reformulate undersampled radial MRI as modeling target image from sparse-view projections using Fourier Slice theorem.
- Train a MLP network to output pixel intensities given spatial coordinates by minimizing rendering loss between projections from predicted image and actual undersampled k-space data.
- Network adapts to single undersampled scan, does not need external training data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel undersampled MRI reconstruction method using implicit neural representation that is highly adaptive to individual scans.
- Effectively leverage NeRF concept for modeling MRI physics and reformulate problem as neural rendering task.
- Model learns intra-image intensity relations rather than inter-image statistics like other data-driven methods.
- Experiments show high quality reconstruction even from very limited data and better detail/anomaly preservation.
- Potential for applications like fetal MRI where obtaining diverse training data is difficult.
- Analysis of effective undersampling patterns that maximize regularity of projection data.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach for undersampled MRI leveraging implicit neural modeling that can effectively reconstruct high-quality scan-specific images from very sparse data without need for external training data.
