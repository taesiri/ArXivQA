# [Lenna: Language Enhanced Reasoning Detection Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02433)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes Lenna, a novel Language Enhanced Reasoning Detection Assistant for multimodal object detection. Lenna incorporates a special <DET> token into the vocabulary of a multimodal large language model to enable transferring of both semantic reasoning and localization information to a detector module without loss. This allows leveraging the knowledge and reasoning capacity of large language models for detection tasks requiring implicit reasoning. Lenna outperforms state-of-the-art methods on referring expression comprehension datasets like RefCOCO while requiring 7x lower training costs. The authors also introduce a new ReasonDet benchmark to evaluate reasoning detection performance. Experiments demonstrate Lenna's superior reasoning ability, accurately grounding objects from complex implicit questions and long descriptive contexts. The simplicity of Lennaâ€™s design, with minimal architecture changes, also makes extending it to other vision-language tasks straightforward and low-cost. Key innovations include the <DET> token for bridging reasoning and detection, a new reasoning detection benchmark, and an efficient yet high-performing model effective for situation-based detection requiring inference skills.
