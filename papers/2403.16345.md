# [Enhanced Facet Generation with LLM Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16345)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Previous works on facet generation leverage search engine result pages (SERPs) to enhance performance. However, relying on SERPs has challenges: search engines constantly change, public search engines cannot access private/internal documents, and external communication is required.  

- The goal is to develop a facet generation framework that operates independently from search engines, using only the query as input.

Proposed Solution: 
- Multi-task learning to predict not only facets but also documents and related queries. This provides a better understanding of the query without relying on external search modules.  

- Editing the facets from a small fine-tuned model using a large language model (LLM). The small model provides the distribution of desired facets that the LLM alone does not have. The LLM then regenerates improved facets.

Main Contributions:
- A facet generation framework that works with only the query as input, eliminating dependency on search engines.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-task learning to deeply understand the query.

- Proposing LLM editing to leverage both a small fine-tuned model and LLM knowledge, outperforming using either one alone.

- Achieving state-of-the-art performance without search engine result pages, validated via both automatic metrics and LLM-based evaluation.

- Showing LLM editing boosts performance for various base facet generation models, not just the proposed model.

In summary, the key ideas are query-only input, multi-task learning, and combining small and large models via LLM editing to predict high-quality facets. The framework does not rely on search engines and achieves top results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes multi-task learning and large language model editing to enhance facet generation from queries without relying on a search engine.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a framework to generate query facets that operates independently of a search engine, using only the query as input. This eliminates dependence on external search results that may change between training and testing.

2) Introducing two strategies to improve facet generation without search engine results:
- Multi-task learning to predict search engine result pages (SERP) during training. This helps the model better understand queries without relying on external modules. 
- Editing the facets predicted by a small fine-tuned model using a large language model (LLM). The small model provides prior distributional information about the dataset to the LLM, making it easier for the LLM to generate accurate facets.

3) Showing that their proposed model FD+M+E achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLM-based evaluation compared to previous methods that leverage search engine results, while not relying on a search engine.

4) Demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM editing by applying it to previous models and showing varying degrees of performance improvement. This indicates it is an effective technique regardless of the small model used.

In summary, the key innovation is facet generation without dependence on a search engine, via strategies of multi-task learning and LLM editing. FD+M+E outperforms previous search-engine dependent methods in LLM-based evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Facet generation - The main task focused on generating different sub-intents or facets for a query.

- Search clarification - Closely related to facet generation in providing diverse search results. 

- Multi-task learning - One of the proposed strategies to predict facets without relying on a search engine by also predicting related information like documents and queries.

- LLM editing - The other proposed strategy of using a large language model to refine and improve the facets predicted by a small model, taking advantage of the LLM's knowledge. 

- Query representation - Related work on constructing representations of search queries using things like term frequencies, embeddings, and language models.

- MIMICS dataset - The dataset from previous work used for evaluation, consisting of search queries, documents, related queries, and facet labels.  

- Automatic evaluation metrics - Metrics used like Term Overlap, Exact Match, BLEU, and BERTScore to quantitatively evaluate facet generation performance.

- LLM evaluation - Proposed use of large language models as evaluators to judge the quality of generated facets.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with facet generation, strategies like multi-task learning and LLM editing to improve it without search engine dependency, evaluation using both automatic metrics and LLM assessment.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes multi-task learning to predict SERP instead of using it as a source. How does predicting SERP help the model understand queries more deeply without relying on external modules? Can you explain the intuition behind this?

2. The paper combines a small, fine-tuned model with a large language model (LLM) for facet generation. Why is it more effective to edit the small model's facets with the LLM rather than just instructing the LLM to generate facets end-to-end? 

3. How exactly does providing the LLM with intermediate facets from the small model help convey the target facet distribution better compared to few-shot learning? Can you elaborate on this concept?

4. The paper demonstrates superior performance both in automatic metrics and LLM-based evaluation. What are some potential weaknesses or limitations of solely relying on LLM evaluation?

5. Could the proposed multi-task learning approach be improved by incorporating structured information (e.g. hypernyms, HTML) in addition to document snippets? Why or why not?

6. The paper shows LLM editing helps more for poorer performing models. Does this indicate there is a "sweet spot" in terms of model performance where LLM editing is most impactful? Why?

7. Chain-of-thought prompting and contrastive prompting help in LLM tasks. How could exploring prompts like these potentially boost the performance of LLM editing further?

8. The statistics show LLM editing reduces duplicate facets - could limiting facets explicitly also help? How might the total number of facets generated impact overall performance?

9. Smaller LLMs (7B, 13B) still showed strong improvement from LLM editing. What factors determine what LLM size is most suitable for the editing approach?

10. The method does not use search engine information during testing. What modifications would be needed to support dynamically incorporating up-to-date SERP data to potentially further improve accuracy?
