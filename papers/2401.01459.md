# [Outlier Ranking in Large-Scale Public Health Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Disease control experts need to manually analyze large volumes of noisy, nonstationary public health data streams to identify important outliers worth investigating further. These outliers may correspond to data errors, delays, or disease outbreaks.  
- However, existing univariate outlier detection methods scale poorly and return too many tied maximally outlying points across streams for experts to examine manually.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new task called "multi-stream outlier ranking" to address this problem. The goal is to rank the outputs from univariate methods applied per stream to better prioritize expert attention.
- A novel algorithm called "Outshines" is proposed for this task. It models hierarchical relationships between streams and uses extreme value analysis to rank outliers by their extremity compared to recent historical behavior across streams.

Key Contributions:
- Outshines outperforms other ranking methods on traditional outlier evaluation metrics in comparisons using real public health data streams.
- In deployed use since April 2023, experts using Outshines are able to identify outliers worth investigating 9.1x faster than their prior manual analysis baseline.
- The algorithm is flexible to handle different data streams and volumes. The implementation and evaluation materials are open-source.
- This is the first method that can effectively rank outliers from large-scale public health data to better utilize expert time. It also introduces the new problem formulation of multi-stream outlier ranking.

In summary, the paper addresses the key challenge of scaling univariate outlier detection methods to large numbers of public health data streams. The proposed Outshines algorithm and new ranking task allow experts to analyze outliers much more efficiently.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

To address the challenge of disease control experts needing to manually review an overwhelming number of maximally-tied outliers from large-scale public health data streams to identify important phenomena, the authors propose a new task of multi-stream outlier ranking and a novel algorithm, Outshines, that leverages hierarchical relationships and extreme value analysis to rank the outputs of univariate outlier detection methods applied per stream, which improved the rate of expert identification of outliers worth investigating by 9.1x in deployment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task of multi-stream outlier ranking for public health data streams and an algorithm called Outshines to address this task. 

Specifically, the paper:

1) Identifies the problem that existing univariate outlier detection methods return too many tied maximum-priority outliers when applied to large-scale public health data streams, making it difficult for experts to investigate them manually. 

2) Formally defines the new task of multi-stream outlier ranking, where the goal is to rank the outputs of univariate methods applied per stream to better prioritize expert attention.

3) Proposes a novel algorithm called Outshines that leverages hierarchical relationships between streams and extreme value analysis to generate informative rankings. 

4) Demonstrates through expert evaluations that Outshines outperforms other ranking methods on traditional metrics and allows experts to identify important outliers 9.1x faster than baseline.

5) Provides an open-source implementation of Outshines that has been deployed at the Delphi research group since April 2023.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution is the proposal of the multi-stream outlier ranking task and the Outshines algorithm to address the practical challenge of scaling univariate outlier detection to large-scale public health data streams.

The paper introduces the task of multi-stream outlier ranking to address the challenge of too many false positive outliers being returned by univariate methods applied to large-scale public health data streams. The proposed Outshines algorithm leverages hierarchical relationships and extreme value analysis to rank the outliers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that Outshines works by taking as input the test statistics (φ) from any univariate outlier detection method. How does Outshines ensure that the ranking of each φ matches the ranking from the expert-provided labels c per stream? What adaptations would be needed if the rankings did not match?

2. In the Problem Formulation section, the paper states that candidate algorithms will be assessed using a range of traditional outlier classification and ranking metrics. What specific metrics were used in the comparisons shown in Figure 3? Why were those metrics selected?  

3. When creating the blocks for the modified block maxima approach, what are the tradeoffs between using a larger vs. smaller temporal dimension? How was the 28 day temporal range determined to be optimal?

4. The paper compares Outshines to Threshold Ranking and Sibling Ranking approaches. What are the key differences between these approaches and Outshines in terms of the empirical reference distribution P used for ranking?

5. In the Evaluation section, the paper states that experts only reviewed a small subset of the full dataset. What sampling strategy was used to select the outliers that were presented to experts? How might the sampling impact the evaluation results?

6. For the EWMA univariate method, how were the specific parameters like the kernel weighting function and formulas for φ selected? What adjustments were made after initial deployment based on expert feedback?

7. The quantitative deployment results show Outshines found outliers worth investigating 9.1x faster than the baseline. What explains this order-of-magnitude improvement in productivity? How was the baseline rate of 0.033 Events/Minute determined?

8. The paper focuses exclusively on applications in public health. What adaptations would be needed to apply Outshines to other complex, hierarchical datasets like those from climate science, economics, or network monitoring? 

9. The Method Overview section states that Outshines can handle changing, missing, and revised historical data. How does the approach deal with these types of incomplete or shifting data streams?

10. For the pooled empirical distribution P used by Outshines, why does the method only take the maximum value from each block rather than a different percentile or threshold? How sensitive is performance based on this design choice?
