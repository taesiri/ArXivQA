# [Position Paper: Why the Shooting in the Dark Method Dominates   Recommender Systems Practice; A Call to Abandon Anti-Utopian Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02152)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Applied recommendation systems rely on A/B testing to evaluate performance, but lack principles for proposing new systems to test. This leads to a "shooting in the dark" approach of using loose proxies instead of directly optimizing rewards.

- Academic solutions like reinforcement learning are impractical due to extreme data requirements even for toy problems. Common simplifications like contextual bandits discard too much useful information.

- Maximum likelihood estimation fails for high-dimensional context-action spaces with uneven/sparse signals. Complex losses proposed in academia are hard to implement.

Solution:
- Propose using deep learning tools, but not deep models. Bespoke probabilistic models can capture all available information from user timelines. 

- Variational Bayesian approximation enables incorporating informative priors to handle uneven/sparse signals, unlike maximum likelihood.

- Matrix normal priors using similarity information from shooting in the dark methods provide strong regularization.

Contributions:
- Identified core disconnect between industry practice and academic solutions for reward optimization.

- Demonstrated estimation challenges even under strong contextual bandit assumptions using Bayesian decision theory. 

- Proposed leveraging recent advances in deep learning tooling for custom modeling and approximate inference as a path forward.

In summary, the paper makes a case for a new approach to building reward-optimizing recommender systems using flexible deep learning tools, but avoiding some common academic pitfalls regarding formulations and estimation. The feasibility of learning directly from available signals is argued to be within reach.
