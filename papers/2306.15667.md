# [PoseDiffusion: Solving Pose Estimation via Diffusion-aided Bundle   Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15667)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:Can camera pose estimation be effectively formulated and solved within a diffusion probabilistic modeling framework?Specifically, the authors propose a new method called PoseDiffusion that introduces a diffusion framework to model the probability distribution of camera poses given input images. They hypothesize that the iterative nature of diffusion models aligns well with bundle adjustment optimization for camera pose estimation. Additionally, they propose using geometric constraints from feature matches to guide the diffusion process and refine the predicted poses. The key hypothesis is that by combining the strengths of diffusion models and classical geometry constraints, their method can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in both sparse and dense camera pose estimation scenarios, outperforming traditional SfM pipelines and recent learned approaches. Experiments on object-centric and scene-centric datasets aim to validate the superiority of their formulation and approach.In summary, the central research question is whether diffusion probability modeling can advance the camera pose estimation problem, seamlessly integrating the powers of learning and geometry. The experiments and results then aim to test this hypothesis and highlight the benefits of their proposed PoseDiffusion method.
