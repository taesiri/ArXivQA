# [Enhancing Multi-Hop Knowledge Graph Reasoning through Reward Shaping   Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Knowledge graph reasoning (KG-R) aims to infer new knowledge from existing graphs, but faces challenges due to inherent incompleteness leading to false negatives and misleading positives. 
- Existing walk-based query answering methods using reinforcement learning encounter difficulties in training due to KG incompleteness and on-policy nature of algorithms like REINFORCE.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage transfer learning to pretrain a "Reward Shaper" module on a rich general KG before fine-tuning on sparse domain-specific KG.  
- Introduce contextual embeddings into the rich KG to enhance generalization capability of reward shaping to provide more nuanced guidance to policy.
- Explore using BERT embeddings and prompt learning to refine reward shaping.

Methodology:
- Simulate rich and sparse KGs by masking 50% of nodes/edges in source KG.
- Conceptualize reward shaping as multi-label classification problem using BERT + classifier.
- Alternatively, use prompt learning with T5 to predict tail entity token probability as score.

Results:
- Prompt learning reward shaping pretrained on rich KG performs best, outperforming ConvE baseline and BERT contextualization across most metrics.
- Contradicts hypothesis that rich KG would overfit - sparse KG reward shaping actually works better.

Key Contributions:
- Novel split KG reasoning framework with transfer learning for reward shaping.
- Integration of contextual embeddings from BERT and prompt learning to enhance policy guidance. 
- Empirical validation showing performance gains on UMLS KG using proposed techniques.
- Insights into effective transfer learning for sparse KG reasoning tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces a new transfer learning approach using reward shaping for improving multi-hop reasoning on incomplete knowledge graphs, with empirical evidence for the advantages of this technique.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes novel methods of using transfer learning and natural language techniques like BERT embeddings and prompt learning to improve the reward shaping process in reinforcement learning for multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a new approach to enhancing multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning through reward shaping techniques. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes a "Split Multi-Hop KG Reasoning" method that involves pre-training a Reward Shaper module on a rich (densely populated) knowledge graph before applying it to a sparse target knowledge graph. This transfers general relational knowledge to improve reasoning on the sparse graph.

2) The paper enriches the reward shaping process by incorporating BERT pre-training and prompt learning to better leverage the textual content and semantics of the knowledge graph. 

3) The paper conducts experiments on the UMLS dataset, evaluating variants using BERT contextualization, prompt learning, and ConvE for the Reward Shaper module. The prompt learning approach achieves the best performance in enhancing the multi-hop reasoning capabilities.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and evaluating a new transfer learning and reward shaping approach to improve multi-hop reasoning on sparse knowledge graphs, with promising results that set a precedent for future research. The use of prompt learning specifically for reward shaping in this context is presented as a novel methodological advancement.
