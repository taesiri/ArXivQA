# [Scalable and Independent Learning of Nash Equilibrium Policies in   $n$-Player Stochastic Games with Unknown Independent Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01587)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies a subclass of stochastic games with independent player state transitions and unknown transition probabilities. A decentralized online mirror descent algorithm is proposed for the players to learn an approximate Nash equilibrium. This algorithm uses confidence sets to maintain estimates of the unknown transition probabilities. Under minimal assumptions, the algorithm is shown to converge at a polynomial rate to an approximate equilibrium in terms of the averaged Nikaido-Isoda gap function. Further, under an additional stability assumption on the existence of a unique and stable Nash equilibrium, the algorithm is shown to converge asymptotically to an approximate equilibrium. Key features of the proposed algorithm are its decentralization, theoretical convergence guarantees, and applicability to relevant multi-agent stochastic games with independent dynamics. The polynomial convergence rate and asymptotic convergence results advance the literature on learning in games by identifying new subclasses of games that admit efficient independent learning of equilibria. Potential extensions include relaxing requirements to encourage exploration and improving sampling strategies to construct gradient estimates. Overall, this is an important contribution towards scalable and decentralized learning of equilibria in relevant classes of stochastic games.
