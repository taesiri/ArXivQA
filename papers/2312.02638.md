# [Synchronization is All You Need: Exocentric-to-Egocentric Transfer for   Temporal Action Segmentation with Unlabeled Synchronized Video Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02638)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method to transfer a temporal action segmentation model trained on exocentric videos to the egocentric domain, using unlabeled synchronized video pairs. The authors leverage existing labeled exocentric data and collect new unlabeled synchronized video pairs capturing the same scenes from both egocentric and exocentric views. They design a knowledge distillation approach that transfers information at the feature extractor and downstream action segmentation model levels. Experiments on a new benchmark based on Assembly101 demonstrate improvements over unsupervised domain adaptation and sequence alignment baselines. The best approach performs on par with models trained on labeled egocentric supervision, without needing any egocentric labels. Specifically, it improves the edit score by +15.99% compared to solely using exocentric training data. The results validate that temporal synchronization provides an effective self-supervisory signal for exocentric-to-egocentric model adaptation, reducing the need for expensive egocentric label collection.
