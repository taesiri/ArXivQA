# [FACTUAL: A Novel Framework for Contrastive Learning Based Robust SAR   Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for automatic target recognition (ATR) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have shown vulnerability to adversarial attacks. 
- Existing defense methods train models on random perturbations, neglecting real-world attack feasibility.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose FACTUAL, a novel contrastive learning framework for adversarial training and robust SAR image classification.

Key Components:
1) Adversarial Pre-Training Network:
    - Uses a novel perturbation scheme incorporating realistic physical attacks like OTSA.
    - Utilizes class labels to cluster clean and perturbed images in a more informative feature space.

2) Linear Classifier:
    - Cascaded after the encoder to predict target labels from computed representations.

Contributions:
- Pre-trains and fine-tunes the model on both clean and adversarial samples for high accuracy on both.
- Achieves 99.7% accuracy on clean samples and 89.6% on perturbed samples, outperforming prior art.
- Supervised contrastive learning utilizes labels to develop more informative and effective pre-training.
- Realistic physical attacks like OTSA improve robustness to real-world perturbations.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel adversarial training framework for SAR image classification that uses supervised contrastive learning and realistic physical attacks to learn robust representations for high accuracy on both clean and adversarially perturbed samples.
