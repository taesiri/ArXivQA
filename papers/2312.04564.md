# [EAGLES: Efficient Accelerated 3D Gaussians with Lightweight EncodingS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04564)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to significantly compress 3D Gaussian point cloud scene representations used for novel view synthesis while maintaining high visual quality. The key ideas are: 1) Quantizing the color, rotation, and opacity attributes of each Gaussian point using a latent encoding scheme to reduce storage memory by over 10x. 2) Employing a progressive training strategy that starts rendering at low resolution and scales up, improving optimization stability and quality while accelerating training. 3) Controlling the frequency of Gaussian densification (cloning and splitting) to obtain fewer, non-redundant points for faster rendering and lower memory. Evaluated on multiple datasets, the approach reduces memory by over an order of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art in Gaussian splatting, cuts training times in half, doubles rendering speeds, and achieves comparable or higher visual quality to top-performing neural rendering techniques. The compact representations enable real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices. Key ablations analyze the impact of each component, showing significant gains in efficiency with little to no compromise in reconstructed view quality.
