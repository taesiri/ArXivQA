# [Embedded Named Entity Recognition using Probing Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extracting semantic information from generated text (e.g. for fact checking) typically requires separate models during inference which increases computational cost. Alternatively, fine-tuning the language model is destructive.
- There is a need for an efficient way to perform information extraction directly within pretrained language models during text generation without finetuning them.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a method called Embedded Named Entity Recognition (EMBER) which embeds NER capabilities into language models using probing classifiers. 
- This involves a tokenwise entity typing classifier based on hidden states and a span detection classifier using attention weights. 
- The predictions are aggregated to produce end-to-end span-level entity predictions.

Main Contributions:
- EMBER enables efficient simultaneous text generation and NER in decoder-only LMs without finetuning them or needing separate models.
- Experiments using GPT-2 XL show EMBER has minimal impact on token generation rates (only ~1% slowdown).
- EMBER can achieve 85% F1 on NER benchmarks while only needing <1% additional parameters relative to the LM size.  
- Analysis explores how model architecture parameters like hidden size and number of attention heads impact EMBER's effectiveness.
- EMBER surpasses in-context learning for NER when more training data is needed than fits into the context.
- First demonstration of incremental NER during streaming text generation which efficiently updates predictions only for new tokens.

In summary, the key novelty is efficiently embedding NER into decoder-only LMs without being destructive, enabling simultaneous generation and extraction. The small computational overhead unlocks new applications compared to standard approaches.
