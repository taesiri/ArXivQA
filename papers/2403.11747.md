# [Embedded Named Entity Recognition using Probing Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extracting semantic information from generated text (e.g. for fact checking) typically requires separate models during inference which increases computational cost. Alternatively, fine-tuning the language model is destructive.
- There is a need for an efficient way to perform information extraction directly within pretrained language models during text generation without finetuning them.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a method called Embedded Named Entity Recognition (EMBER) which embeds NER capabilities into language models using probing classifiers. 
- This involves a tokenwise entity typing classifier based on hidden states and a span detection classifier using attention weights. 
- The predictions are aggregated to produce end-to-end span-level entity predictions.

Main Contributions:
- EMBER enables efficient simultaneous text generation and NER in decoder-only LMs without finetuning them or needing separate models.
- Experiments using GPT-2 XL show EMBER has minimal impact on token generation rates (only ~1% slowdown).
- EMBER can achieve 85% F1 on NER benchmarks while only needing <1% additional parameters relative to the LM size.  
- Analysis explores how model architecture parameters like hidden size and number of attention heads impact EMBER's effectiveness.
- EMBER surpasses in-context learning for NER when more training data is needed than fits into the context.
- First demonstration of incremental NER during streaming text generation which efficiently updates predictions only for new tokens.

In summary, the key novelty is efficiently embedding NER into decoder-only LMs without being destructive, enabling simultaneous generation and extraction. The small computational overhead unlocks new applications compared to standard approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called Embedded Named Entity Recognition (EMBER) which enables extracting named entities from decoder-only language models during text generation without finetuning by using simple probing classifiers trained on the models' internal representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing EMBER (Embedded Named Entity Recognition), a light-weight approach for adding NER capabilities to decoder-only language models without finetuning them. Specifically, the paper shows that:

- EMBER can achieve F1 scores of 80-85% for NER while requiring minimal additional parameters (<1% relative to the LM size) and computational overhead.

- It enables efficient simultaneous text generation and NER, with only about a 1% slowdown in token generation rate compared to a 43.64% slowdown for using a separate NER model. 

- It can easily integrate substantially larger amounts of training data than in-context learning approaches that are limited by the context size.

- The number of attention heads has a greater impact on EMBER's performance than hidden state dimensionality, for the decoder LMs examined.

In conclusion, the key contribution is an efficient, non-destructive method to add information extraction capabilities to decoder-only LMs using simple probing classifiers. This enables novel applications like streaming text generation with simultaneous NER.

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Embedded Named Entity Recognition (EMBER) - The proposed approach for adding NER capabilities to decoder-only language models using probing classifiers.

- Probing classifiers - Simple classifiers trained on a subset of a language model's internal representations to predict linguistic properties. Used in EMBER for entity typing and span detection. 

- Decoder-only language models - The type of generative language model that EMBER is designed to work with, without fine-tuning or destroying the model.

- Named entity recognition (NER) - The information extraction task that involves detecting entity mentions and their types. EMBER performs NER on streaming generated text.

- Entity typing - One subtask of NER that involves assigning the correct entity type to detected mentions. EMBER uses hidden state probes for this.

- Span detection - The other subtask of NER that involves locating entity mention spans. EMBER uses attention weight probes.  

- Label propagation - The method EMBER uses to assign the entity types predicted for individual tokens to entire spans.

- Streaming text generation - EMBER enables efficient simultaneous text generation by a language model and extraction of named entities from the incrementally generated text.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using probing classifiers on decoder-only language models for named entity recognition. What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to using separate named entity recognition models during inference?

2. The method uses two different probing classifiers, one for entity typing based on hidden states and one for span detection based on attention weights. Why is this two-pronged approach useful? What challenges arise from using two separate classifiers?  

3. The paper finds that entity typing performance correlates strongly with the dimensionality of the hidden representations. Why might this be the case? What implications does this have for choosing which decoder LM architecture to use?

4. For span detection, performance correlates more closely with the number of attention heads rather than overall model size. What might explain this finding? How could the attention mechanism be exploited further to improve span detection?

5. The paper shows improved performance when training the span detection probe on generated text rather than original text. What differences in the attention weights between generated and original text could account for this? 

6. What kinds of texts or domains do you think this approach would work well or poorly for? When would using separate named entity recognition models be more appropriate?

7. The method is applied to English text, but the paper notes it may face challenges when applied to other languages. What linguistic properties might make this approach more or less suitable for other languages?  

8. The paper frames this as a non-destructive way of adding capabilities to decoder LMs. What other kinds of information extraction or capabilities could be added to decoder LMs in a non-destructive way?

9. The method still lags behind state-of-the-art performance. What improvements could be made to the model architecture or training process to further close this gap?  

10. The paper focuses on named entity recognition, but how could this approach of using internal model representations be extended to other information extraction tasks like relation extraction or event extraction? What additional challenges might arise?
