## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating coherent and credible explanation trees (entailment trees) to demonstrate the reasoning process behind a hypothesis remains a major challenge in AI. 
- Existing methods for entailment tree generation often overlook the importance of generating intermediate conclusions with logical consistency from the premises, leading to inaccurate or unreliable explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the Logical Pattern Memory Pre-trained Model (LMPM) to address the above limitations. 
- LMPM incorporates an external memory structure to learn and store latent representations of logical patterns. This aids in generating logically consistent intermediate conclusions during entailment steps.
- To mitigate the influence of irrelevant domain knowledge in the Wikipedia-based training data, the authors introduce an entity abstraction approach to construct the pre-training dataset. This guides the model to focus on fundamental logical relationships.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of LMPM with a memory structure to capture logical patterns between premises and conclusions. This significantly enhances the model's reasoning capacity.
- Construction of an entity-abstract dataset via abstraction techniques to pre-train LMPM. This mitigates the impact of irrelevant knowledge and reduces data needs. 
- Evaluations demonstrate LMPM generates superior entailment trees with more coherent and logically consistent intermediate conclusions compared to strong baselines.
- Analysis provides insights into LMPM's ability to differentiate and leverage different types of logical patterns to improve reasoning.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions regarding integrating logical patterns into entailment tree generation through a specifically designed memory-based model. The pre-training and abstraction techniques prove beneficial in improving performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a logical pattern memory pre-trained model (LMPM) that uses an external memory to store and reuse latent logical patterns between premises and conclusions, guiding the generation of logically consistent intermediate nodes in iterative entailment tree creation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the Logical Pattern Memory Pre-trained Model (LMPM) which uses an external memory to learn and store representations of logical patterns. This aids in generating logically consistent intermediate conclusions during entailment steps.

2. Pre-training the LMPM model using a constructed entity-abstract dataset to explicitly guide the model to learn representations of latent logical patterns. This mitigates the influence of irrelevant domain knowledge and enables effective training with less data. 

3. Evaluating the proposed method on entailment tree generation datasets using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. Results demonstrate that LMPM outperforms baseline models in most cases and provides effective representations of logical patterns for generating better entailment trees.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting LMPM to leverage logical patterns for generating logically consistent intermediate conclusions in entailment trees, and showing its effectiveness over baseline methods. The use of entity abstraction and external memory are also notable contributions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing the Logical Pattern Memory Pre-trained Model (LMPM)? Why does capturing logical patterns effectively matter in the entailment tree generation task?

2. How does LMPM employ an external memory structure to learn and store latent representations of logical patterns? What are the components of this memory structure? 

3. What is the entity abstraction approach used in the paper and why is it important? How does abstracting entities help mitigate the influence of irrelevant domain knowledge?

4. Explain the two key training tasks used for LMPM - Logical Pattern Pre-training and EntailmentBank Fine-tuning. What is the purpose of each task?

5. The paper mentions logical deductions involving multiple logical patterns, as shown in Figure 5. How does LMPM combine multiple logical pattern representations to generate appropriate conclusions in such cases?

6. Analyze the results of the ablation study in detail. What do the performance impacts of removing LPP, memory structure, and dataset abstraction signify?

7. Figure 6 shows the impact of logical pattern data size. Compare the trends in Task 1 and 2. Why does LMPM achieve good performance even with 25% of data?

8. The probability distribution in Figure 7 indicates clustering tendencies for different logical patterns. What can be the potential causes behind LMPM's relative neglect of a specific logical feature?

9. How does LMPM enhance existing multi-step generative methods like METGEN? What modifications were made to integrate LMPM into METGEN? 

10. Analyze the three case studies in the Appendix, explaining how LMPM helps generate logically consistent conclusions. Compare the performances of METGEN+T5 and METGEN+LMPM.
