# [PuzzleVQA: Diagnosing Multimodal Reasoning Challenges of Language Models   with Abstract Visual Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13315)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large multimodal models such as GPT-4V have shown impressive capabilities, but it is unclear how well they can emulate human cognitive processes and general reasoning abilities. Specifically, the authors aim to evaluate how these models interpret information, make generalizations from observations, and apply principles to solve problems. They are also interested in understanding how the models reason about basic concepts like numbers, colors, shapes and sizes.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose evaluating reasoning skills of large multimodal models using abstract visual patterns focused on fundamental concepts. They introduce PuzzleVQA, a diverse dataset of abstract reasoning puzzles automatically generated using templates. The puzzles require models to perceive images, induce patterns and deduce answers. Ground truth explanations are provided to enable diagnosing reasoning bottlenecks. Experiments are conducted on models like GPT-4V, Claude 3 and Gemini Pro in zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes evaluating reasoning skills of multimodal models using abstract patterns instead of real-world knowledge.
2) Introduces PuzzleVQA, an interpretable dataset of abstract reasoning puzzles with ground truth explanations.
3) Experiments show even advanced models like GPT-4V solve <50% puzzles, indicating challenges in visual perception and inductive reasoning. 
4) Analysis reveals providing ground truth explanations significantly improves performance, highlighting reasoning weaknesses.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that despite their sophistication, large multimodal models still face significant challenges in abstract visual reasoning, falling short of human cognitive abilities. The proposed PuzzleVQA dataset enables systematically evaluating and diagnosing these reasoning limitations.
