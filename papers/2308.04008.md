# [Coarse-to-Fine: Learning Compact Discriminative Representation for   Single-Stage Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04008)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we design an efficient single-stage image retrieval framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency without needing to perform additional re-ranking using local features?

The key points are:

- The paper aims to develop a single-stage image retrieval framework that does not require expensive local feature re-ranking like two-stage methods. This makes it more efficient.

- However, existing single-stage methods have weaker performance compared to two-stage methods. So the goal is to improve single-stage accuracy to match two-stage methods.

- The proposed method tries to achieve this by jointly learning a compact yet discriminative global image representation in an end-to-end manner.

- Specifically, the authors propose a Coarse-to-Fine framework with two components:
    - A novel adaptive loss (MadaCos) to enhance intra-class compactness of features.
    - A local feature matching module with hard negative sampling to improve inter-class distinctiveness.

- By combining strengths of both global and local feature learning through this framework, the goal is to improve single-stage retrieval accuracy without compromising efficiency.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that by jointly learning global representations enhanced with relevant local feature information in an end-to-end framework, they can improve single-stage retrieval accuracy to match two-stage methods while retaining efficiency. The proposed Coarse-to-Fine framework aims to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposes a Coarse-to-Fine (CFCD) framework to learn compact and discriminative global image representations for efficient single-stage image retrieval. 

- Designed a novel adaptive softmax loss called MadaCos that dynamically tunes its scale and margin based on median target logits within each mini-batch to strengthen supervision and increase intra-class compactness.

- Proposed to select prominent local descriptors from attention maps and introduced triplet loss with hard negative sampling to leverage fine-grained relations between matches for improving inter-class distinctiveness.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-stage image retrieval benchmarks like Revisited Oxford and Paris compared to previous global feature learning methods.

- Does not require expensive local feature re-ranking during inference like two-stage methods, making it more efficient while achieving comparable accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end trainable coarse-to-fine framework with adaptive loss and local feature matching that learns compact and discriminative global features for efficient and accurate single-stage image retrieval.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a Coarse-to-Fine framework to learn Compact Discriminative image representations for efficient single-stage image retrieval by dynamically tuning loss hyperparameters and selecting salient local features to refine the global descriptor.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of image retrieval:

- It proposes a new single-stage image retrieval framework called CFCD (Coarse-to-Fine Compact Discriminative representation) that aims to achieve higher efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Many recent works have focused on two-stage retrieval with global and local features, which can be slower.

- The paper introduces two main technical contributions - an adaptive loss function called MadaCos for learning a compact global representation, and a local feature matching strategy with hard negative sampling to enhance the distinctiveness of the global features. These are novel techniques compared to prior work.

- Experiments show that CFCD achieves state-of-the-art results on standard image retrieval benchmarks like Revisited Oxford and Paris, outperforming other recent single-stage methods like DOLG and Token. It also approaches the accuracy of top-performing but slower two-stage methods.

- The paper demonstrates the benefits of infusing global features with aligned local feature information in a training-only manner. Other works fuse global and local features through attention modules or feature concatenation, which can be expensive at inference time.

- The approach is evaluated on landmark recognition tasks with Google Landmarks datasets. Many recent image retrieval papers have used this challenging dataset with diverse viewing conditions.

In summary, this paper pushes forward single-stage image retrieval by proposing a new compact representation learning framework and training techniques to enhance global features with local information. The results are state-of-the-art for single-stage retrieval while being more efficient than two-stage approaches. The techniques represent interesting research directions compared to existing literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the robustness of the single-stage image retrieval framework to handle more challenging variations like extreme viewing angles, heavy occlusions, etc. The authors mention that their method still struggles with some very difficult cases.

- Exploring more advanced losses or training strategies to further enhance the compactness and discriminability of the learned global image representations. The authors propose some effective techniques like MadaCos and triplet loss with hard negative sampling, but there is room to develop even better solutions. 

- Applying the proposed framework to other retrieval tasks beyond landmarks, such as products, documents, general images, etc. Evaluating the generalization ability of the approach to diverse domains.

- Reducing the inference time and memory footprint further to enable real-time retrieval on large-scale datasets and constrained devices. The authors have improved efficiency over two-stage methods but single-stage retrieval still has challenges here.

- Combining global and local features in an optimal way, instead of just infusing local info into the global feature. Finding better fusion approaches to leverage both effectively.

- Leveraging unlabeled or weakly labeled data to further improve the learned representations in a self-supervised manner. The current method relies on image-level labels.

- Adapting the framework for cross-modal retrieval tasks where queries and retrieved items are of different modalities, like sketch-based image retrieval.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving robustness, representation learning, efficiency, feature fusion, using alternative supervision, and extending to new tasks/modalities. Advancing single-stage retrieval along these lines could enable wider practical deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Coarse-to-Fine framework to learn Compact Discriminative representations (CFCD) for efficient single-stage image retrieval. The framework consists of two components: 1) A novel adaptive softmax loss called MadaCos that dynamically tunes hyperparameters like scale and margin based on statistics of each mini-batch to progressively enhance supervision and improve intra-class compactness of the learned global features. 2) A local feature matching module with hard negative sampling that selects prominent local regions as constraints to construct triplets and introduces a triplet loss to leverage fine-grained semantic relations between images. This helps infuse the global features with inter-class distinctiveness. The unified framework is trained end-to-end requiring only image labels. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art single-stage retrieval performance on benchmarks like Revisited Oxford and Paris. The coarse-to-fine strategy trades off efficiency and accuracy without re-ranking overhead unlike two-stage methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework called Coarse-to-Fine to learn Compact Discriminative representations (CFCD) for single-stage image retrieval. The goal is to develop an efficient image retrieval method that achieves good accuracy without needing to re-rank results using expensive local feature matching. 

The proposed CFCD framework has two main components. First, it uses a novel adaptive softmax loss called MadaCos to train the global image features. MadaCos dynamically tunes the scale and margin of the loss function over training batches to progressively strengthen supervision and improve intra-class compactness. Second, it selects prominent local descriptors from attention maps and uses them to construct image triplets along with hard negative sampling. Adding a triplet loss allows incorporating fine-grained local information to enhance inter-class distinctiveness in the global features. Experiments on standard benchmarks show CFCD achieves state-of-the-art single-stage retrieval accuracy. It outperforms methods relying solely on global or local features, and approaches the accuracy of two-stage methods without the added computational cost of feature re-ranking.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine framework to learn compact and discriminative image representations for efficient single-stage image retrieval. The main ideas are:

- They first use a novel adaptive softmax loss called MadaCos to train global image features. MadaCos dynamically tunes the scale and margin of the loss function based on statistics of the current mini-batch to progressively strengthen supervision and improve intra-class compactness. 

- To enhance inter-class distinctiveness, they introduce a triplet loss with hard negative sampling to leverage fine-grained local feature matches. Specifically, they select matching local regions from attention maps as constraints to construct informative triplets. The triplet loss serves to refine the global features by integrating aligned local semantic relations.

- The overall framework consists of two stages: first training global features with MadaCos, then combining MadaCos and triplet loss to jointly optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. The resulting compact and discriminative global image representation achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-stage retrieval benchmarks with high efficiency.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel coarse-to-fine approach to learn global image representations that are both compact within each class and highly discriminative between different classes, which significantly improves efficiency and accuracy for single-stage image retrieval.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of learning compact discriminative representations for efficient and accurate single-stage image retrieval. The key challenges it aims to tackle are:

- Current two-stage image retrieval methods that use global and local features are inefficient due to having to rank images twice and use expensive geometric verification like RANSAC or AMSK. 

- Existing single-stage methods that fuse global and local features into a joint representation struggle with various image conditions like background clutter, occlusion, viewpoint changes, etc.

- Simply adopting ArcFace loss to train the whole model end-to-end is tricky and unstable.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a Coarse-to-Fine (CFCD) framework to learn Compact and Discriminative representations for single-stage image retrieval that requires only image-level labels. The key ideas are:

- Use an adaptive softmax loss called MadaCos that dynamically tunes its scale and margin to strengthen supervision and increase intra-class compactness.

- Select prominent local descriptors and incorporate fine-grained semantic relations using hard negative triplet loss to improve inter-class distinctiveness.

- Jointly train with MadaCos and triplet loss in a coarse-to-fine manner without needing expensive local feature branches.

So in summary, the paper aims to develop an end-to-end framework for efficient and robust single-stage image retrieval that learns compact and discriminative global representations by adaptively strengthening supervision and incorporating local geometric relations.
