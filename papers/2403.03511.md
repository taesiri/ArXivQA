# [Illuminating the property space in crystal structure prediction using   Quality-Diversity algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Crystal structure prediction (CSP) aims to computationally discover new crystal structures and materials. It is challenging due to the exponentially large search space. 
- Typical optimization techniques like evolutionary algorithms can get stuck in local optima and do not aim to find diverse sets of high-performing structures. This limits understanding of the property space.
- Methods based on density functional theory (DFT) are too computationally expensive for techniques requiring many evaluations.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithm called MAP-Elites to illuminate the property space and find a diverse set of elite (high-performing) crystal structures.
- MAP-Elites optimizes for diversity in user-defined feature space (e.g. band gap, shear modulus) while locally maximizing fitness (e.g. energy).
- Employ fast machine learning models to enable a high number of evaluations. Models used: CHGNet (energy), MEGNet (shear modulus), matgl (band gap).

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate MAP-Elites can find ground state structure for TiO2 along with 10 other unique matches to known structures.
- Validate on C, SiC and SiO2 systems where novel structures are found, showing versatility of technique.  
- Show ability of method to find structures that exploit surrogate models, enabling model improvement.
- Propose use of QD techniques in materials science to illuminate property spaces and find diverse sets of materials.

The method makes minimal assumptions about crystal systems and relies on surrogate models, allowing application to a wide range of systems to uncover materials with optimal and conflicting properties.
