# [A Survey on Autonomous Driving Datasets: Data Statistic, Annotation, and   Outlook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents an exhaustive survey and analysis of over 200 autonomous driving datasets for various tasks like perception, prediction, planning and control.

The key problem this paper aims to address is that while there are many autonomous driving datasets publicly available now, there lacks a systematic study reviewing these datasets comprehensively considering factors like sensor modalities, data attributes, annotation methodology, data distribution analysis, etc. 

To solve this problem, the paper first introduces a novel metric called "impact score" to evaluate the influence of a perception dataset. The impact score considers the citation numbers, data dimensions like size and labels, and diversity of conditions. Using this metric, the paper selects and reviews several high-impact datasets in perception, prediction and planning/control tasks.

The paper also studies the annotation process and quality factors in detail as good quality ground truth data is critical for developing reliable autonomous driving systems. Both manual and automatic annotation pipelines are explained. Metrics like consistency, correctness and precision that affect annotation quality are analyzed.  

Additionally, the paper provides insightful data analysis from aspects like geographic distribution which shows a bias towards western countries, chronological trends showing recent focus on synthetic and V2X data, and statistics of object densities and distances in several key datasets.

Finally, the paper discusses latest technology trends and future directions like incorporation of language, leveraging large language models for data generation and domain adaptation.

In summary, this is the most comprehensive survey on autonomous driving datasets to date with over 200 datasets cataloged. The novel impact score provides an objective metric for judging perception datasets. The exhaustive data analysis and future outlook provide valuable guidance for research community to develop better algorithms through understanding data distributions and upcoming trends. The work fills an important gap by systematically reviewing this fast evolving field of autonomous driving datasets.
