# [Differentiable and accelerated wavelet transforms on the sphere and ball](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Wavelet transforms are useful tools for multiscale analysis of signals and images. They have shown promise for enhancing various machine learning techniques when applied to data in Euclidean spaces. However, many scientific fields deal with data defined on spherical manifolds such as the 2D sphere or 3D ball. Existing software packages for wavelet analysis on the sphere and ball (S2LET, FLAGLET) lack key properties needed to integrate them with modern machine learning: differentiability and hardware acceleration. This has limited the ability to apply recent advancements like embedding wavelets in neural networks or leveraging wavelets for conditioning generative models.

Proposed Solution:
The authors develop novel algorithms and open-source software libraries for fast, differentiable wavelet transforms on the sphere (S2WAV) and ball (S2BALL). The libraries are implemented in JAX to enable automatic differentiation and deployment on accelerators like GPUs. Efficient computation is achieved by leveraging recent advances in spin spherical harmonic transforms (provided by S2FFT software). The wavelet transform algorithms use tensor operations and Fourier transforms adapted to spherical/spherical-Laguerre harmonic space. Precomputing certain components reduces memory overhead. Multiresolution schemes retain full information while evaluating only highest harmonic degrees that dominate complexity.

Main Contributions:
- S2WAV: Up to 300x faster spherical wavelet transforms vs S2LET, with machine precision accuracy and automatic differentiation.
- S2BALL: Up to 22,000x faster wavelet transforms on the ball vs previous FLAGLET software. Enables previously infeasible analysis techniques.  
- Sampling agnostic algorithms support common sphere/ball pixelizations. Highly parallelizable across multiple GPUs.
- Enable integration of wavelet techniques with machine learning on spheres/balls for the first time. This can enhance neural networks, diffusion models, invariant representations, etc.
- Publicly available JAX libraries lower barriers to use cases across scientific domains like astrophysics, geophysics, computer vision.

In summary, the paper introduces high-performance differentiable wavelet transform libraries for spheres and balls that can unlock new analysis capabilities by fusion with modern machine learning approaches. The impressive accelerations also facilitate more traditional techniques at higher resolutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops new highly parallel and automatically differentiable algorithms and software for directional wavelet transforms on the sphere and ball to accelerate analysis and enable integration with modern machine learning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is the development of new algorithms and software for efficient, differentiable, and accelerated directional wavelet transforms on the sphere and ball. Specifically:

- For the sphere, the authors develop the S2WAV library which provides GPU-accelerated and automatically differentiable directional wavelet transforms. These transforms are shown to be much faster (up to 300x) compared to existing implementations.

- For the ball, the authors develop the S2BALL library which also provides GPU-accelerated and differentiable directional wavelet transforms. These transforms are shown to be five orders of magnitude faster than previous implementations. 

In addition, both libraries are developed in JAX to allow easy integration with modern machine learning frameworks. The transforms are also designed to be sampling agnostic and easily distributable across multiple GPUs.

In summary, the main contribution is the new algorithms and associated open-source software to bring directional wavelet analysis on the sphere and ball to the forefront of modern differentiable computing. This enables various applications at the intersection of wavelets and machine learning on these manifolds.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses computing wavelet transforms efficiently on the sphere and ball by leveraging GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation. Can you elaborate on why being able to automatically differentiate the wavelet transforms is useful? What types of applications does this enable?

2. The paper uses scale-discretized wavelets that have compact harmonic support. Can you explain in more detail how this compact support allows the use of a multiresolution algorithm to accelerate the wavelet transforms? 

3. When constructing the wavelet dictionaries, the paper uses directional autocorrelation functions to capture azimuthal/directional information. What is the intuition behind using the autocorrelation function for this purpose? How does it capture directionality?

4. For the radial direction, the paper uses Laguerre polynomials and Gauss-Laguerre quadrature to achieve an exact transform. Can you explain why the Laguerre basis was chosen over other options like spherical Bessel functions? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The software implementation leverages precomputation and caching of certain components like the wavelet filters. What is the memory vs computational complexity tradeoff associated with this precomputation? When might you not want to use precomputation?

6. Can you walk through the mathematical derivation that leads to the overall algorithm for the forward and inverse wavelet transforms on the ball (Equations 17 and 18)? What are the key mathematical objects and operations?

7. The runtime complexity of the algorithms is dominated by spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms. How does the software leverage distribution across GPUs to achieve further acceleration in practice? What are the limitations?

8. The discussion mentions the possibility of using the spherical Laguerre and Wigner-Laguerre transforms for other applications like equivariant networks. Can you suggest some specific ways these transforms could be utilized?

9. How exactly does the software handle different pixelization schemes or samplings on the sphere? What are some commonly used schemes and what are their tradeoffs?

10. The numerical validation shows very large speedups compared to previous CPU implementations. Are there any numerical accuracy or precision tradeoffs associated with the GPU acceleration? How does the software ensure accurate transforms?
