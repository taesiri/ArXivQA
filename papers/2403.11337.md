# [Enhancing Bandwidth Efficiency for Video Motion Transfer Applications   using Deep Learning Based Keypoint Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video motion transfer applications like video conferencing, VR gaming, and medical monitoring require real-time high-quality video transmission at low bandwidth. 
- Existing keypoint-based motion transfer methods already provide 10x bandwidth reduction but have high compute requirements.
- Additional bandwidth savings are needed without compromising video quality or increasing compute requirements.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a pipeline using First Order Motion Model (FOMM) for motion transfer and a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) for keypoint prediction.
- Keypoints capturing motion are predicted using VRNN to enable lower FPS transmission from source device. 
- Predicted keypoints are synthesized into video frames using FOMM's generator network.

Contributions:
- First work exploring VRNN-based keypoint prediction for bandwidth reduction in motion transfer applications.
- Achieves 2x additional bandwidth savings over FOMM pipeline without keypoint prediction.  
- Saves compute requirements on client devices compared to not using prediction.
- Demonstrates superior performance of VRNN over RNN and VAE for keypoint prediction using 3 diverse datasets. 
- Provides both numerical metrics and qualitative results to showcase efficacy of proposed approach.
- Enables net 20x+ bandwidth reduction compared to traditional video codecs.
- Allows high quality real-time motion transfer applications even with lower connectivity devices.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel VRNN-based keypoint prediction approach to enhance bandwidth efficiency in FOMM motion transfer applications without compromising quality or increasing compute requirements. Keypoint prediction provides additive bandwidth savings over FOMM and demonstrates the suitability of VRNN for modeling complex motion dynamics.
