# [Multiscale Neuroimaging Features for the Identification of Medication   Class and Non-Responders in Mood Disorder Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07858)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Accurately diagnosing and prescribing medications for mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder is challenging due to complex symptoms and variability in patient response. 
- Using biomarkers from neuroimaging to help predict patient response could improve clinical decision making.
- Prior approaches using single-scale neuroimaging features may be limited in capturing enough information.

Proposed Solution:
- Utilize a new multi-scale template called Neuromark to extract 105 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) across multiple spatial scales from resting-state fMRI data.
- Apply these multi-scale ICNs as features to train a kernel support vector machine model to predict medication response.  
- Compare performance to a model using ICNs from a single-scale Neuromark template.
- Apply a soft sequential forward selection method for robust ICN selection.

Data:
- 147 subjects - 33 controls, 35 bipolar disorder, 67 major depression disorder, 12 unknown diagnosis
- fMRI data acquired during resting state  
- Subjects clinically labeled with medication class (antidepressants or mood stabilizers) that produced best response 

Results/Contributions:
- Multi-scale ICN features improved model performance over single-scale features for predicting medication class.
- Soft sequential feature selection further improved results over prior selection method.  
- Best model utilized both multi-scale spatial maps and functional network connectivity measures with F1 score of 0.89 and AUC of 0.96.
- Identified novel biomarkers from visual, cerebellar, temporal, subcortical, somatomotor, and cognitive networks.
- Demonstrated utility of multi-scale neuroimaging features to aid prediction of medication response for improved clinical support.
