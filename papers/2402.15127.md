# [Multi-Armed Bandits with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15127)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper introduces a novel extension of the multi-armed bandit problem by allowing the agent to "abstain" from accepting the stochastic reward before observing it. In this framework, the agent chooses an arm and also decides whether to abstain at each time step. If the agent abstains, it either suffers a fixed regret (fixed-regret setting) or gains a guaranteed reward (fixed-reward setting), compared to the initial regret/reward associated with choosing the arm. This added complexity enriches the strategic considerations around balancing exploration and exploitation.  

Key questions: Can we develop algorithms that are both asymptotically optimal (optimal regret scaling as the time horizon grows) and minimax optimal (optimal worst-case regret) for this problem? What insights does the abstention option provide about online decision-making?

Proposed solution:

Fixed-regret setting:
The paper designs a Thompson Sampling-based algorithm that integrates two carefully constructed abstention criteria to achieve asymptotic and minimax optimality. 

Fixed-reward setting: 
The paper introduces a general strategy that transforms any asymptotically and minimax optimal algorithm for the canonical bandit problem into one that retains these optimality guarantees when extended to allow for abstention.

Main contributions:

- Formulates the multi-armed bandit problem with two complementary abstention settings: fixed-regret and fixed-reward.

- Proposes algorithms for both settings and shows they achieve asymptotic and minimax optimality simultaneously.

- Derives matching asymptotic and minimax lower bounds.

- Provides numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefit of incorporating the abstention option.

The results provide a rigorous characterization of the abstention model. They highlight that while the exploration-exploitation trade-off remains pivotal, abstention reduces exploration costs. The fixed-reward setting enables broader algorithmic flexibility.
