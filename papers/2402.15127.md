# [Multi-Armed Bandits with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15127)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper introduces a novel extension of the multi-armed bandit problem by allowing the agent to "abstain" from accepting the stochastic reward before observing it. In this framework, the agent chooses an arm and also decides whether to abstain at each time step. If the agent abstains, it either suffers a fixed regret (fixed-regret setting) or gains a guaranteed reward (fixed-reward setting), compared to the initial regret/reward associated with choosing the arm. This added complexity enriches the strategic considerations around balancing exploration and exploitation.  

Key questions: Can we develop algorithms that are both asymptotically optimal (optimal regret scaling as the time horizon grows) and minimax optimal (optimal worst-case regret) for this problem? What insights does the abstention option provide about online decision-making?

Proposed solution:

Fixed-regret setting:
The paper designs a Thompson Sampling-based algorithm that integrates two carefully constructed abstention criteria to achieve asymptotic and minimax optimality. 

Fixed-reward setting: 
The paper introduces a general strategy that transforms any asymptotically and minimax optimal algorithm for the canonical bandit problem into one that retains these optimality guarantees when extended to allow for abstention.

Main contributions:

- Formulates the multi-armed bandit problem with two complementary abstention settings: fixed-regret and fixed-reward.

- Proposes algorithms for both settings and shows they achieve asymptotic and minimax optimality simultaneously.

- Derives matching asymptotic and minimax lower bounds.

- Provides numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefit of incorporating the abstention option.

The results provide a rigorous characterization of the abstention model. They highlight that while the exploration-exploitation trade-off remains pivotal, abstention reduces exploration costs. The fixed-reward setting enables broader algorithmic flexibility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a multi-armed bandit model with an abstention option, analyzes algorithms for regret minimization in fixed-regret and fixed-reward variants, and shows both theoretically and empirically that the abstention option can significantly reduce regret.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces and analyzes a novel extension of the multi-armed bandit problem where the agent has the additional option to "abstain" from accepting the stochastic reward before observing it. The key contributions are:

1) Formulating two complementary versions of the abstention model: fixed-regret and fixed-reward settings. These generalize the canonical bandit problem.

2) For the fixed-regret case, developing an asymptotically and minimax optimal algorithm based on judiciously adapting Thompson Sampling. Matching lower bounds are also provided. 

3) For the fixed-reward case, proposing a general strategy that transforms any asymptotically and minimax optimal algorithm for the canonical setting into one that retains these optimality guarantees when incorporating abstention.

4) Conducting experiments on synthetic data to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the benefits of allowing for abstention.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis quantifying the value of equipping bandit algorithms with an abstention option, while ensuring optimal regret guarantees.

The paper introduces an extension of the multi-armed bandit problem where an agent has the option to "abstain" from accepting a reward before observing it. Two settings are analyzed: a fixed-regret setting where abstaining incurs a constant regret, and a fixed-reward setting where abstaining guarantees a fixed reward. Algorithms are developed that incorporate abstention criteria while achieving asymptotic and minimax optimality in minimizing regret. Concepts like Thompson Sampling and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff are also relevant in the context of this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the incorporation of an abstention option in the multi-armed bandit framework lead to a more challenging exploration-exploitation trade-off for the learning agent? What new complexities arise and how are they addressed algorithmically? 

2) The paper introduces complementary fixed-regret and fixed-reward formulations for modeling the abstention option. What are the key differences between these formulations both conceptually and in terms of the resulting analytical characterizations? 

3) For the fixed-regret setting, the paper bases the arm sampling rule on Less-Exploring Thompson Sampling. What is the rationale behind this choice and what modifications need to be made to integrate the abstention criteria?

4) What is the intuition behind using the lower confidence bound defined in Equation 3 as one of the abstention criteria? How does this choice impact the capability to control worst-case regret magnitudes?  

5) What novel proof techniques are introduced in the analyses of asymptotic optimality for both the fixed-regret and fixed-reward settings? How do they address the intricate Dependencies between the sampling dynamics and the abstention decisions?

6) How does the phase transition behavior in the minimax regret guarantees highlight key differences between the fixed-regret and fixed-reward formulations? What drives this phenomenon for the former but not the latter?

7) The fixed-reward formulation leads to a simple and elegant algorithm in Algorithm 2 that transforms any standard MAB algorithm into one that handles abstentions. What aspects of the problem structure enable this generalization? What restrictions does it entail?

8) The numerical experiments focus on corroborating specific aspects of the theoretical results, especially asymptotic optimality and the impacts of varying abstention penalties/rewards. What other experiments could provide further insights into the benefits and limitations of the framework?

9) How might the analyses change for structured bandit settings like linear bandits? Would the proposed algorithms still achieve optimality guarantees? Is the abstention option more or less valuable in such contexts?

10) Can the abstention model be extended to more complex online learning settings like online convex optimization? Would similar performance improvements be observed? What new analyses would be required?
