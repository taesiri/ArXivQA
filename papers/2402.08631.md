# [Knowledge Editing on Black-box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08631)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge editing (KE) aims to efficiently update language models to rectify outdated information or incorporate new knowledge, without negatively impacting other knowledge. 
- Existing KE methods focus on white-box scenarios where model internals are accessible. However, typical deployment provides black-box access via APIs.
- Current evaluation relies on logit changes, inapplicable to black-box models. Evaluation also overlooks style retention, leading to incomplete assessment.

Proposed Solution:
- A new evaluation framework for black-box KE, assessing editing from textual and semantic perspectives. Also evaluates style retention from textual and semantic views.
- A novel "postEdit" approach that post-processes black-box model outputs to edit knowledge. Uses an expert "post-editor" model to make focused edits to responses, guided by recalled edits from memory.
- Post-editor training incorporates original/edited response augmentation and filtering for quality. Training supervision maintains privacy and style.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive KE evaluation for black-box scenarios, incorporating style retention metrics.
- PostEdit framework that resolves privacy concerns and style over-editing issues in prior black-box methods. Editing occurs downstream through post-processing.
- Experiments on benchmarks show postEdit outperforms baselines in editing efficacy and significantly excels in style retention. Analysis demonstrates robust generalization.

In summary, the paper tackles key challenges in black-box KE by proposing improved evaluation and a novel post-editing approach. The postEdit method effectively balances editing performance and stylistic consistency while protecting privacy. Comprehensive analysis verifies strong generalization across models, data, and scales.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel post-editing approach called postEdit for knowledge editing on black-box large language models, which can post-process model outputs to update specific knowledge while maintaining privacy and style consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It introduces knowledge editing on black-box large language models and proposes a multi-perspective evaluation framework that incorporates the assessment of style retention for the first time. 

2. It proposes a novel postEdit method that can post-edit the output of language models through an expert model in a plug-in manner while maintaining the privacy of downstream editing data.

3. Experiments on two benchmarks and extensive analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baselines in both editing performance and style retention, showing robust generalization.

In summary, the paper focuses on knowledge editing for black-box models, proposes an improved evaluation framework, and introduces a post-processing based method that achieves strong performance while preserving privacy and style consistency. The method is demonstrated to generalize well across different settings.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Knowledge editing (KE)
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Black-box LLM editing
- Evaluation framework 
- Editing metrics (textual editing, semantic editing)
- Retention metrics (textual retention, semantic retention)  
- Privacy leakage of editing data
- Style over-editing
- PostEdit method
- Post-editor model
- Edit memory
- Retriever
- Textual style consistency

The paper introduces the concept of knowledge editing on black-box large language models, where only textual outputs of models are available. It proposes an improved evaluation framework incorporating editing and retention metrics. The paper also presents a postEdit method to address issues with privacy leaks and style over-editing by post-processing model outputs. Key components include the post-editor model, edit memory, and retriever. A goal is maintaining textual style consistency when editing knowledge.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the postEdit method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that postEdit helps address privacy concerns by operating at the downstream end. Can you elaborate on how the post-processing mechanism specifically ensures privacy of editing data? 

2. In the postEdit framework, what is the rationale behind using a separate post-editor model rather than just fine-tuning the base LLM itself to edit responses?

3. The paper argues that the post-editor makes "fine-grained" modifications to responses to preserve style. Can you explain what mechanisms allow it to identify and edit specific spans rather than rewriting entire responses?  

4. What is the motivation behind using augmented training data from both the base LLM and GPT-4 to supervise the post-editor? How does this enhance the quality and diversity of training data?

5. How exactly does the postEdit training procedure allow the post-editor to discern whether a query requires editing or not? What role does the special <Retain> token play?  

6. In the ablation studies, why does removing rephrased queries from training data significantly impact performance on in-scope test queries as well? What does this indicate about the model?

7. The paper shows postEdit has strong generalization across base models and datasets. What properties of the method make this transfer of editing abilities possible without retraining?

8. When postEdit recall fails, how could erroneous edits propagate through the pipeline? Are there ways to address this to make editing more robust?  

9. The analysis explores storage/computation tradeoffs between parameter editing methods and memory-based methods like postEdit. Can you suggest ways postEdit could further improve efficiency?

10. Beyond fact verification and QA, what other potential applications could benefit from specialized post-editing models for knowledge updating like postEdit? What challenges might arise?
