# [Causal Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Causal Perception":

Problem:
The paper addresses the issue of perception, where two individuals interpret the same information differently based on their own experiences and perspectives. This phenomenon has implications in machine learning systems that aim to model human decision-making. Specifically, perception affects issues around fairness and bias, as fairness is a subjective concept dependent on who is judging. The paper argues that most fair automated decision-making (ADM) systems use a single, objective view of fairness, failing to account for multiple interpretations and perception. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a causal framework to model perception based on structural causal models. It defines causal perception as occurring when two "receivers" (individuals or models) equipped with their own structural causal models disagree in how they reason about the same information causally. This includes disagreeing on cause-effect relationships (unfaithful perception) or the nature of causal effects (inconsistent perception). 

To capture differing interpretations, the framework represents each receiver's "experience" via conceptualization and operationalization mappings. The conceptualization mapping categorizes variables into descriptive features, while the operationalization mapping represents causal relationships between categories/features. These mappings allow encoding additional contextual knowledge that shapes reasoning. The paper also defines "loaded attributes" like gender that tend to evoke differing interpretations.

The framework models perception without prioritizing one view, allowing for subjective rather than absolute notions of bias based on disagreements between receivers. This enables fairness formulations with perception as a parameter of interest rather than an obstacle.

Contributions:
1) A probabilistic and causal formulation of perception occurring between individuals/models interpreting the same information
2) The notion of loaded attributes prone to elicit perception 
3) Formalizing experience via categorization and signification mappings that translate variables into structured causal knowledge
4) A causal perception framework to represent and reason about multiple views and subjective bias
5) Positioning perception as a useful parameter for achieving fairness under competing interpretations

The framework lays groundwork for applications in fairness under competing causal graphs, modeling sensitive attributes, human-in-the-loop systems, and explanation systems robust to multiple views.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper formalizes perception as differences in probabilistic and causal reasoning between individuals interpreting the same information, argues perception is driven by experience captured via categorization and signification of loaded attributes, and presents a causal framework modeling individual experience to reason about perception.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a causal framework for formalizing perception, specifically causal perception, in decision-making scenarios where multiple individuals may interpret the same information differently. The main contributions are:

1) It defines perception and causal perception as probabilistic and causal probabilistic problems, respectively, capturing differences in interpretation between individuals. 

2) It introduces the notion of "loaded attributes", which are attributes prone to elicit differing interpretations due to associated stereotypes and individual experiences. Sensitive attributes like gender and race are key examples.

3) It presents a framework based on structural causal models to represent individual experience and causal reasoning. This includes formalizing processes like categorization and signification that shape how individuals perceive information.  

4) It defines two kinds of causal perception - unfaithful perception due to disagreements on cause-effect relationships, and inconsistent perception due to disagreements on the nature of causal effects. These are illustrated through examples.

5) It positions perception as a parameter of interest in fairness applications, enabling extensions of problems like fair representation learning and algorithmic fairness under multiple competing interpretations.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel causal formulation of perception aimed at accounting for multiplicity of interpretations in decision-making scenarios relevant to AI fairness. The framework lays the groundwork for future research on achieving fairness under perception.

The paper proposes a causal framework to model perception - how different individuals can interpret the same information differently based on their own experiences. Key concepts include using structural causal models to capture individual experience and causal reasoning, defining "loaded attributes" like sensitive attributes that are prone to evoking differing perceptions, and introducing categories like unfaithful and inconsistent perception to model disagreements in causal interpretations between individuals. Applications to algorithmic fairness are also discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the causal perception framework proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that perception is driven by the representativeness heuristic from Kahneman and Tversky's work. Can you expand more on this heuristic and how it manifests itself in the problem of perception? What other psychological theories could help explain perception?

2. The paper defines "loaded attributes" as attributes prone to elicit perception among receivers. What are some examples of loaded attributes beyond sensitive attributes like race and gender? What makes an attribute "loaded" and why are loaded attributes key to modeling perception?

3. The paper presents two main types of causal perception - unfaithful and inconsistent. Can you walk through an example that illustrates the difference between these two types? What are the implications of each type for reasoning about fairness? 

4. The signification process involves transforming conceptual associations into causal weights. What are some ways this transformation could be implemented computationally? What are the challenges in quantifying these conceptual relationships?

5. The paper argues perception should be a parameter of interest in fairness formulations. What are some ways existing fairness metrics or procedures could be extended to account for perception? How would you evaluate "fairness under perception"?

6. The paper discusses causal consistency theory in defining inconsistent perception. Can you explain more about what causal consistency means and why it's relevant? When can we say consistency breaks between two receivers?

7. What are the limitations of using structural causal models to capture human reasoning and perception? What alternative frameworks could also be useful for modeling perception?

8. The paper focuses on perception between two receivers. How could the framework be extended to model perception between multiple stakeholders? What new complexities arise?  

9. One application is modeling perception in human-AI collaboration. What are some ways the causal perception framework could be used in such applications? What new challenges emerge when a human is in the loop?

10. What kind of data would be needed to learn the categorization and signification sets of different receivers? What methods could be used to elicit additional causal knowledge from stakeholders?
