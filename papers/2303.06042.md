# [MVImgNet: A Large-scale Dataset of Multi-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06042)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question this paper addresses is: How can we reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videos from sequences that alternate between different exposures? Specifically, the paper proposes a new method for HDR video reconstruction that utilizes both image alignment and feature fusion. The key questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can aligning and fusing images in both the image space and feature space produce better HDR video results compared to methods that operate in just one space?- Can a two-stage framework that first aligns and fuses images in the image space, and then operates on features extracted from those fused images, outperform existing approaches?- Will their proposed method enable high quality HDR video reconstruction from challenging real-world video footage captured with alternating exposures?To evaluate these questions, the paper introduces a new real-world dataset of videos captured with alternating exposures and compares the proposed two-stage method against other approaches on both synthetic and real-world data. The results generally support the efficacy of their method for the HDR video reconstruction task.In summary, the central research question is how to effectively reconstruct HDR video from alternating exposure sequences, with a two-stage image alignment and fusion approach proposed as a potential solution. The key hypotheses are that this framework and operating in both image and feature spaces will produce superior results to existing techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the tables in the paper, it seems the main contribution is proposing a new method (labeled "Ours") for HDR video reconstruction from sequences with alternating exposures. The paper evaluates the proposed method ("Ours") against several other methods (labeled A, B, C) on two datasets (A and B). The metrics used for evaluation are PSNR, HDR-VDP, and HDR-VQM. The results are reported separately for low/middle/high exposure frames as well as averaged over all frames.The key findings are:- On both datasets, the proposed method ("Ours") achieves the best performance on almost all metrics and exposure settings. The improvements over prior methods are quite significant based on the numbers reported.- The proposed method seems especially strong on reconstructing the low exposure frames, where it outperforms other methods by a large margin as measured by PSNR and HDR-VDP.- The proposed method also achieves the highest HDR-VQM scores on both datasets, which evaluates the overall visual quality.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel HDR video reconstruction method that advances the state-of-the-art across different metrics and exposure conditions based on experiments on two datasets. The paper demonstrates superior performance both numerically and perceptually.
