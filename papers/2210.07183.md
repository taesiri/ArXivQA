# [Visual Classification via Description from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07183)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:Can visual classification with vision-language models be improved by using descriptive features generated from large language models, rather than just class name embeddings?The key points are:- Current vision-language models like CLIP perform zero-shot classification by comparing image embeddings to word embeddings of class names. - This paper proposes an alternative approach: generate descriptive features for each class using a large language model like GPT-3, and compare images to embeddings of these descriptions instead.- The hypothesis is that using descriptive features will provide benefits like:  - Improved classification accuracy  - More interpretable decisions   - Ability to adapt models to new concepts not seen during training  - Editable classifiers to correct biases and errors- Experiments are conducted using CLIP as the vision-language model and GPT-3 to generate descriptors, evaluating on ImageNet and other datasets.- Results show improvements in accuracy, interpretability, adaptability to new concepts, and ability to correct biases compared to just using class name embeddings.In summary, the central hypothesis is that using descriptive features from language models can improve upon the standard approach of just comparing images to class name embeddings in vision-language models. The experiments aim to demonstrate these advantages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new framework for zero-shot image classification with vision-language models. Rather than just comparing images to category name embeddings like in standard zero-shot classification, the paper proposes generating descriptive features for each class using a large language model. Images are then classified by comparing them to these descriptive features instead of just the class name. The key benefits of this approach highlighted in the paper are:- It provides inherent interpretability, as the model justification comes from comparing the image to human-readable descriptive features rather than just outputting a category name. - It improves accuracy across various datasets compared to just using class name embeddings.- It enables adapting the vision-language models to novel unseen categories by querying a regularly-updated language model for new descriptive features.- It allows editing the descriptive features to correct biases or errors in the vision-language model's decisions.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting an alternative zero-shot classification paradigm for vision-language models using descriptive features from a large language model, which provides improvements in accuracy, interpretability, adaptability, and correctability compared to the standard approach of just using class name embeddings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a new framework for zero-shot image classification with vision-language models, where instead of comparing images directly to class name embeddings as is standard, category descriptors obtained from a large language model are used, improving performance and providing inherent interpretability and editability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in vision-language models and interpretable AI:- Most prior work on interpreting vision-language model decisions has focused on post-hoc methods like saliency maps or attention. This paper proposes an inherently interpretable method where the model must provide justifications using descriptive features.- The idea of using language model-generated descriptions as an intermediate representation is novel. Prior work has used attributes, but required manual creation or learning of these. Automatically generating descriptions with large LMs provides more flexibility.- Rather than compromising on accuracy for interpretability like some prior work, this method actually improves accuracy by incorporating external knowledge into the classifier via the descriptors.- The demonstrated capabilities like adapting models to novel categories and correcting biases go beyond standard classification benchmarks. This shows additional promising applications of the descriptor-based framework.- Most prior descriptor-based classifiers required descriptors tailored for each dataset. A key advantage here is transferring descriptors across diverse visual domains like ImageNet, CUB, and satellite images without dataset-specific engineering.- The approach connects interpretability methods to recent trends in foundation models like CLIP and GPT-3. It provides a way to improve these models instead of replacing them.Overall, the paper innovatively combines modern vision-language and language models to create an interpretable classifier that also improves accuracy and generalizability. The applications to bias mitigation and adapting models to new knowledge also demonstrate usefulness beyond standard benchmarks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring the interplay between hand-designed prompts and language model generated class descriptors. The authors note that their method does not compare to the ensemble of 80 hand-tuned, class-agnostic prompts used for CLIP on ImageNet. They suggest leaving the combination of these two techniques to future work.- Using more advanced prompting strategies when querying the language model for descriptors. The authors used a simple prompting approach but note that performance could likely be improved with more effort on optimizing the prompts.- Scaling up the evaluation to larger and more diverse image datasets. The authors demonstrate results on several datasets, but suggest expanding the analysis to additional domains. - Analyzing failures modes and limitations in more depth. The authors provide some preliminary analysis of failures from the language model and vision-language model but suggest more investigation could be done.- Exploring techniques for continually updating the language model over time. This could help with adapting to novel concepts and changes in the visual world.- Investigating other potential applications of the descriptor framework like dense captioning or visual question answering.- Improving techniques for editing descriptors to mitigate bias and enable control. The authors show initial results but suggest more work can be done in this direction.- Developing procedures for building more structured ontologies between descriptors and categories rather than treating them independently per class.Overall, the authors propose their approach as a promising new framework for interpretation, adaptation, and control of vision-language models using language as an intermediate representation. But they highlight many directions for extending and improving the approach further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a new framework for image classification using vision-language models. Rather than comparing an image embedding directly to class name embeddings as is typical, they instead generate visual descriptors for each class using a large language model like GPT-3. For example, to recognize a tiger they may generate descriptors like "has stripes", "has claws", etc. They compare the image embedding to these descriptor embeddings instead, taking the class with the highest average descriptor similarity. This provides several advantages:- Improves classification accuracy, with gains of 3-5% on ImageNet benchmarks- Provides inherent interpretability, as the model must match descriptors like "stripes" to make its decision- Allows adapting models to new categories not seen during training, by generating new descriptors- Enables editing the descriptors to mitigate bias and other failuresOverall, leveraging language models to produce class descriptors gives vision-language models more of the capacities of human perception and reasoning. The authors demonstrate this yields models that are more accurate, adaptable, and explainable.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new framework for zero-shot image classification using vision-language models like CLIP. The standard approach is to compute similarity between the image embedding and the class name embedding. Instead, the authors propose generating descriptive features for each class using a large language model like GPT-3. For example, to recognize tigers, the model looks for stripes, claws, etc. rather than just the word "tiger". This provides inherent interpretability, as the model must match visual descriptors. The authors show this descriptor-based approach improves accuracy by 3-5% on ImageNet over standard CLIP. It also enables adapting the model to novel classes unseen during training, as the language model can generate new descriptors. Finally, editing descriptors mitigates cultural bias in wedding photos. Overall, the use of interpretable linguistic knowledge as an intermediate representation enables flexibility and improvements over standard vision-language models for classification. The results demonstrate leveraging language models' knowledge helps overcome VLMs' limitations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents an alternative framework for zero-shot image classification with vision-language models like CLIP. Instead of just using the category name as the text query, they generate descriptive features for each category by prompting a large language model like GPT-3. For example, to recognize tigers, instead of just querying "tiger", they query text like "stripes" and "claws" that describe visual features of tigers. To classify an image, they compute the similarity between the image embedding and each of these descriptor embeddings for a class using CLIP, and average the descriptor similarities to get a class score. By comparing to descriptive features, they can provide visual cues to guide the model's focus, while also gaining inherent interpretability from reading which descriptors are activated. The descriptors are obtained automatically from language models rather than by manual construction.
