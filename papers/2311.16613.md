# [Filter-Pruning of Lightweight Face Detectors Using a Geometric Median   Criterion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16613)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes applying structured filter pruning techniques to extremely lightweight face detectors like EXTD and EResFD to derive even smaller and more efficient models without compromising much on accuracy. Specifically, it utilizes the Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM) algorithm along with a Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) iterative procedure to prune redundant filters and minimize information loss. Experiments conducted on the WIDER FACE dataset demonstrate the superiority of FPGM over the baseline L1 Norm pruning technique across different sparsity levels. While higher pruning rates degrade performance considerably, a 10% pruning rate slightly improves detection accuracy owing to the regularization effects of pruning. Overall, the method yields a family of highly compressed face detectors with varying trade-offs between model size and detection performance. The most compressed variant reduces the parameter count of EXTD and EResFD by 50% while retaining reasonable accuracy. By systematically analyzing pruning algorithms tailored to face detectors, this work opens up avenues for their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising too much on reliability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes applying filter pruning techniques, specifically Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM), to further reduce model size of two already lightweight face detectors, EXTD and EResFD, while maintaining or slightly improving detection accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors are the first to apply a redundancy-based pruning algorithm (FPGM) to prune the most redundant filters in lightweight face detection networks like EXTD and EResFD.

2) The proposed approach yields a family of even more lightweight face detection networks that achieve superior detection accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art models of similar size. Specifically, the pruned EResFD model with 10% sparsity even slightly outperforms the original model, suggesting the pruning acts as regularization.

In summary, the key contribution is using the FPGM filter pruning algorithm to derive more compact face detectors from already lightweight models, without significantly sacrificing accuracy. The pruned models with small sparsity rates can even slightly improve on the original models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using the Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM) algorithm for structured pruning of lightweight face detectors. Why is structured pruning preferred over non-structured pruning in this context? What are some of the key advantages offered by structured pruning methods?

2. The FPGM algorithm identifies redundant filters based on the geometric median of the filter set. Provide an in-depth mathematical explanation of how the geometric median is calculated and used to determine filter redundancy within a layer. 

3. The paper utilizes the Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) procedure along with FPGM to iteratively prune filters. Explain the key benefits offered by SFP over permanently pruning filters in one shot. How does the larger optimization space allowed by SFP positively impact model training?

4. Analyze the differences between the FPGM and L1 norm filter pruning criteria from an information redundancy perspective. Why does removing filters closer to the geometric median preserve more information compared to removing smaller norm filters?

5. The paper demonstrates improved performance with FPGM pruning on two compact face detectors - EXTD and EResFD. Compare and contrast the architectures of these detectors. Why are they suitable choices for evaluating lightweight model pruning?  

6. The pruned EXTD model with 10% sparsity shows better mAP than the original EXTD model. Hypothesize technical reasons for why such an accuracy gain is witnessed. Is this behavior commonly observed?

7. The paper only prunes the convolutional layers and excludes layers in the detection head. Justify whether pruning the detection head could offer further compression benefits or hurt model accuracy. Argue both sides.  

8. As sparsity percentages increase, mAP drops more significantly on the Hard subset compared to Easy/Medium subsets of WIDER FACE. Explain the intrinsic differences between these subsets and reasons for the performance drop disparity.

9. The EResFD model has approximately 90,000 parameters making it exceptionally lightweight. Discuss the unique challenges for pruning such an extremely small model compared to larger models. 

10. The paper demonstrates the viability of pruning very compact face detectors without drastic performance drops. Propose other potential applications and use cases that could benefit from similar ultra-lightweight CNN pruning.
