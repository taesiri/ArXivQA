# [WaveGrad: Estimating Gradients for Waveform Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00713)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is proposing a new conditional generative model called WaveGrad for raw audio waveform generation. The key ideas are:

- WaveGrad learns to estimate the gradients of the data density rather than the density itself. It is trained using techniques from score matching and diffusion probabilistic models.

- During inference, WaveGrad starts from Gaussian noise and iteratively refines the signal using a gradient-based sampling procedure conditioned on the mel-spectrogram input. This enables generating high fidelity audio using only a small number of iterations. 

- WaveGrad is non-autoregressive and only requires a constant number of sequential operations during inference. This makes it much faster than autoregressive models.

- Two variants of WaveGrad are explored - one conditioned on discrete iteration indices, and one conditioned directly on the continuous noise level. The continuous variant is more flexible and enables good performance even with few iterations.

- Experiments show WaveGrad can match the audio fidelity of a strong autoregressive baseline using an order of magnitude fewer sequential operations. It also outperforms non-autoregressive adversarial baselines.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling and estimating gradients of the data density, along with the diffusion-based sampling procedure, can enable high quality and efficient non-autoregressive audio generation. The results validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the promise of WaveGrad.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes WaveGrad, a new conditional generative model for audio waveform synthesis. WaveGrad estimates the gradients of the data density rather than the density itself. 

2. It combines techniques from score matching and diffusion probabilistic models to enable fast, non-autoregressive waveform generation. 

3. It introduces two variants of WaveGrad: one conditioned on discrete indices, and one conditioned on continuous noise levels. The continuous variant is more flexible and enables high quality audio with very few iterations.

4. Experiments show WaveGrad can generate high fidelity audio using only 6 iterations, outperforming non-autoregressive baselines like Parallel WaveGAN and MelGAN. It matches the quality of the autoregressive WaveRNN model with much lower computational cost.

5. WaveGrad provides a natural way to trade off inference speed and output quality by adjusting the number of iterations. This helps bridge the gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive models in terms of audio fidelity.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing WaveGrad, a fast non-autoregressive model for high-quality audio synthesis. It combines score matching and diffusion models in a novel way, and the continuous noise level conditioning enables very efficient synthesis. Experiments validate its ability to match autoregressive models with orders of magnitude fewer sequential operations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces WaveGrad, a conditional model for waveform generation that estimates gradients of the data density using techniques from diffusion probabilistic models and score matching; it can generate high-fidelity audio using just 6 iterations of a gradient-based sampler.
