# [WaveGrad: Estimating Gradients for Waveform Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00713)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is proposing a new conditional generative model called WaveGrad for raw audio waveform generation. The key ideas are:

- WaveGrad learns to estimate the gradients of the data density rather than the density itself. It is trained using techniques from score matching and diffusion probabilistic models.

- During inference, WaveGrad starts from Gaussian noise and iteratively refines the signal using a gradient-based sampling procedure conditioned on the mel-spectrogram input. This enables generating high fidelity audio using only a small number of iterations. 

- WaveGrad is non-autoregressive and only requires a constant number of sequential operations during inference. This makes it much faster than autoregressive models.

- Two variants of WaveGrad are explored - one conditioned on discrete iteration indices, and one conditioned directly on the continuous noise level. The continuous variant is more flexible and enables good performance even with few iterations.

- Experiments show WaveGrad can match the audio fidelity of a strong autoregressive baseline using an order of magnitude fewer sequential operations. It also outperforms non-autoregressive adversarial baselines.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling and estimating gradients of the data density, along with the diffusion-based sampling procedure, can enable high quality and efficient non-autoregressive audio generation. The results validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the promise of WaveGrad.
