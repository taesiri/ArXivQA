# [Multi-level Product Category Prediction through Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper investigates applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for multi-category text classification in the retail industry. Specifically, it focuses on using LSTM and BERT neural network models to categorize retail product descriptions into a hierarchy of categories (segment, category, subcategory, product name). Accurate text classification is crucial for organizations to organize large volumes of unstructured data and gain insights. However, multi-category classification is complex due to hierarchical structures and the need for precision at each level.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using data augmentation techniques and focal loss to enhance LSTM and BERT for multi-category text classification. Data augmentation through web scraping is used to increase diversity and representativeness of the training data. Focal loss addresses class imbalance by reducing the weight of majority classes and increasing minority classes. The pretrained BERT model BERTimbau, tailored for Brazilian Portuguese, is utilized for its bidirectional context understanding. The LSTM model incorporates Brazilian Portuguese word embeddings to better capture linguistic nuances.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates effectiveness of BERT and LSTM models for multi-category retail text classification when combined with data augmentation and focal loss
- Achieves high performance for BERT model - F1 Score of 99% for segments, 96% for categories/subcategories, 93% for product names
- Shows value of data augmentation through web scraping and using focal loss for class imbalance 
- Provides insights into model optimization strategies based on retail data characteristics
- Highlights importance of choosing appropriate NLP techniques based on application requirements
- Establishes strong baseline for using advanced NLP in the retail industry

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in applying and optimizing state-of-the-art NLP techniques for a complex multi-category retail classification task. The results showcase the potential of these methods for organizing and extracting insights from retail data.
