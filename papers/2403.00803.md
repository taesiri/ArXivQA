# [LiMAML: Personalization of Deep Recommender Models via Meta Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In recommender systems, deep neural networks have become very popular for modeling diverse business objectives. As user bases expand, personalization and frequent model updates are critical to deliver relevant experiences. Existing approaches have limitations - architectural improvements provide no personalization, while embedding-based personalization requires large data per user. 

Solution - LiMAML:
The paper proposes an innovative meta-learning solution called LiMAML to enable personalization and frequent updates. The key ideas are:

1) Decouple network into a meta block and global block. Meta block is personalized per task (user/entity) via MAML. Global block is shared across tasks.  

2) Meta block outputs fixed-size meta embeddings for each task. These are retrieved during inference and used along with other features by the global block to make predictions.

3) Frequently refresh meta embeddings using recent user interactions via fine-tuning the meta block, enabling adaptations to latest signals.

This approach preserves personalization benefits of MAML, while overcoming productionization challenges for large-scale systems via the decoupled architecture and meta embeddings.

Contributions:
1) LiMAML - An efficient meta-learning productionization strategy for personalization and frequent updates in recommender systems.

2) Extensive offline experiments demonstrating significant AUC gains over strong baselines across multiple real-world applications. 

3) Online A/B tests showing major improvements in CTR and engagement metrics. Detailed cohort analysis reveals substantial uplift for infrequent users.

4) Practical insights into real-world training, pipelines, and serving of meta-learned models at scale.

In summary, the paper presents LiMAML as an impactful industrial-strength application of meta-learning for hyper-personalization in large recommender systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient meta learning approach called LiMAML to enable personalized and frequently updated deep recommendation models by meta learning part of the network to output fixed-size embedding vectors for each user or entity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is an innovative meta-learning solution called LiMAML that is tailored for personalization of models for individual members and other entities in recommendation systems. Specifically:

- It leverages the Model-Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) algorithm to adapt per-task sub-networks using recent user interaction data. This allows personalization and frequent updates based on latest signals.

- It proposes an efficient strategy to operationalize meta-learned sub-networks in production by transforming them into fixed-sized vectors called meta embeddings. This enables deployment at scale.

- It demonstrates through experiments on production data from LinkedIn that LiMAML consistently outperforms baseline models across several applications, including for infrequent members with limited data.

- It has enabled the deployment of highly personalized AI models across diverse LinkedIn applications, leading to substantial improvements in business metrics and user experience.

In summary, the main contribution is an innovative meta-learning based personalization approach that works at scale while preserving benefits of adaptation, allowing large personalized models to be deployed in production recommendation systems.
