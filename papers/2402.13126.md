# [VGMShield: Mitigating Misuse of Video Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the rapid advancement of video generation models based on diffusion models, there are growing concerns about their potential misuse to create and spread fake videos online. This poses threats such as copyright infringement, malicious propaganda, and false information. However, existing detection methods focus mainly on rudimentary video generation models and cannot handle the latest high-quality video diffusion models. Hence effective solutions are needed to mitigate the misuse of state-of-the-art video diffusion models.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes VGMShield - a multi-faceted solution with three key components to tackle the problem:

1. Fake Video Detection: Uses pre-trained video recognition models as backbones to build classifiers that can detect fake videos. Evaluates performance under four real-world scenarios based on awareness of data source and models. Shows MAE-based model works best.

2. Tracing: Traces a fake video back to the source model that generated it by leveraging unique spatial-temporal fingerprints of models. Achieves over 90% accuracy even in most realistic data-agnostic setting.  

3. Prevention: Adds invisible perturbations to images to prevent video generation models from successfully creating videos. Proposes directed and undirected defense strategies. Shows effectiveness against state-of-the-art models.

Main Contributions:

- First defense pipeline tailored to tackle misuse of latest video diffusion models with detection, tracing and prevention
- Comprehensive evaluation covering 7 open-source & 2 commercial models over 11 generation tasks 
- Analysis of detection & tracing via Grad-CAM reveals strengths of MAE-based models  
- Novel directed & undirected prevention strategies that provide invisible protection to images

The solution effectively mitigates concerns around misuse of video generation models through the entire life-cycle, empowering users, creators and regulators.
