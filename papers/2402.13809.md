# [NeuralDiffuser: Controllable fMRI Reconstruction with Primary Visual   Feature Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13809)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is challenging due to the modality gap between fMRI and images. Previous pixel-to-pixel methods result in ambiguous, non-semantic images. 
- Recent methods utilizing latent diffusion models (LDMs) can generate high-quality images but still face issues with unfaithful details and inconsistent repeated results. 

Proposed Solution - NeuralDiffuser:
- Provides a neuroscience perspective on LDMs - they reflect top-down knowledge creation but lack bottom-up perception of details.
- Introduces primary visual feature guidance, decoded from fMRI, to provide detail cues to LDMs in the form of gradients. This brings in the missing bottom-up process.
- Develops a novel guidance strategy with hyperparameters to ensure consistency across repeated LDM generations rather than a variety of results.

Main Contributions:
- Neuroscience-inspired perspective to explain limitation of detail fidelity in LDMs for fMRI reconstruction.
- Primary visual feature guidance to incorporate detail-driven bottom-up process in LDMs.
- Guidance strategy for consistent repeated generations rather than diversity.
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results on Natural Scenes Dataset, with more faithful semantics, details and consistency.
- Approach is independent of choice of LDM and fMRI decoder, hence can augment any existing LDM-based method.

In summary, NeuralDiffuser proposes guidance based on primary visual features, bringing in the missing bottom-up signals to LDMs and achieving new state-of-the-art in fMRI visual reconstruction with improved detail fidelity and result consistency. The insights and techniques can be incorporated into other LDM-based approaches as well.
