# [Mixed Distillation Helps Smaller Language Model Better Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities, but their deployment is challenging due to high computational demands. 
- Smaller models trained via knowledge distillation from LLMs is a promising direction, but they still fall short of matching LLM performance on reasoning tasks.
- Prior distillation works have focused only on distilling the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning of LLMs in natural language, ignoring the program-of-thought (PoT) reasoning in code.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a mixed distillation framework that distills both the CoT and PoT capabilities from LLMs into smaller models.  
- Extract multiple reasoning paths (CoT and PoT) from the LLM on unlabeled data using few-shot prompting.
- Train the smaller model on these paths in a multi-task setting to predict labels and generate relevant reasoning.
- Sampling from both CoT and PoT paths during inference enhances reasoning performance.

Main Contributions:
- First work to utilize LLM-generated PoT paths as extra supervision signal for distillation.
- Show improved capability of smaller models to perform both CoT and PoT reasoning after mixed distillation.
- Sampling from multiple reasoning paths gives superior accuracy over single-path distillation methods.
- Experiments showmodels like Llama2 and T5-Large rival or outperform GPT-3.5 after mixed distillation, highlighting that the reasoning gap between LLMs and smaller models can be bridged. The method also generalizes across different models, dataset sizes and mathematical reasoning datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a mixed distillation framework that leverages and combines the chain-of-thought and program-of-thought reasoning paths from large language models to enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces PoT (Program-of-Thought) as an effective supervisory signal for distillation, previously overlooked, to enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. 

2. It improves the single-path reasoning abilities of smaller models, including both CoT (Chain-of-Thought) and PoT, via integrating PoT with CoT within a multi-path distillation framework.

3. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of leveraging multiple reasoning paths, as smaller models harness the combined strengths, culminating in superior performance on mathematical reasoning datasets. Specifically, on the SVAMP dataset, using a 7 billion parameter Llama2 and CodeLlama in a mixed distillation framework boosts distillation capabilities and outperforms the LLM GPT-3.5-turbo in terms of reasoning accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a mixed distillation framework that distills both CoT and PoT capabilities from LLMs into smaller models, enhancing their reasoning abilities, especially in mathematical reasoning tasks. The framework allows smaller models to match or even exceed the reasoning performance of much larger LLMs.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Mixed distillation - The proposed framework that combines distilling the chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) capabilities from large language models into smaller models.

- CoT (Chain-of-thought) - The natural language narrative reasoning path generated by large language models. 

- PoT (Program-of-thought) - The programming code reasoning path generated by large language models that can be executed.

- Reasoning paths - The explanatory steps generated by LLMs that show the reasoning behind a prediction. Includes both CoT and PoT.

- Knowledge distillation - Transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, simpler model (student).

- Multi-path reasoning - Generating multiple reasoning paths (both CoT and PoT) to improve reasoning ability.

- Mathematical reasoning - Evaluating performance on math word problems and reasoning tasks. Datasets used include SVAMP, GSM8K, ASDIV.  

- Multiple-path distillation - Distilling both CoT and PoT capabilities from LLMs into smaller models.

- Self-consistency voting - Enhancing model performance by generating multiple predictions and taking a "vote" across them.

In summary, the key focus is on using a mixed distillation approach to transfer different reasoning capabilities from large language models to smaller models to improve mathematical and logical reasoning performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the mixed distillation method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions extracting multiple reasoning paths (CoT and PoT) from LLMs. What are some challenges in extracting high-quality and diverse reasoning paths from LLMs? How can the prompt design be improved to generate better reasoning paths?

2. The paper uses a multi-task learning approach to distill CoT and PoT into smaller models. What are some alternative approaches to effectively distill multiple reasoning paths? Could adversarial methods or reinforcement learning be effective?

3. Sampling multiple reasoning paths (CoT+PoT) is shown to boost performance. What factors determine the optimal number of paths to sample? Is there a risk of oversampling paths and causing model degradation? 

4. For mixed distillation, how should the loss weights between the CoT and PoT distillation losses be determined? Is there an optimal ratio that balances between CoT and PoT transfer?

5. The performance gaps between LLMs and distilled small models, although reduced, still exist. What factors contribute most to this gap? How can mixed distillation be improved to minimize this gap further?

6. The paper evaluates on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks. How would mixed distillation perform on more complex reasoning tasks like causal, temporal, or logical reasoning? Are changes to the framework needed?

7. Real-world deployments often have latency constraints. How does mixed distillation comparing to baselines in terms of inference latency? Can latency be reduced further?

8. The paper focuses on distilling explicit reasoning paths. Could mixed distillation be effective for implicit reasoning transfer from LLMs without access to paths?

9. What methods can be used to analyze what knowledge has been distilled by the CoT and PoT paths specifically into the small models? Evaluating what has been transferred remains an open challenge.  

10. The paper studies transfer from a single fixed LLM teacher to small models. How would the framework change if an ensemble of diverse LLMs were used as teachers instead? Could this improve coverage of reasoning skills transferred?
