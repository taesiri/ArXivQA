# [Adaptive Dependency Learning Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown excellent performance for multivariate time series forecasting when a graph structure depicting the dependencies between the time series is available. 
- However, in many real-world forecasting problems, such predefined graph structures rarely exist. This limits the applicability of GNNs for these problems.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a hybrid approach called Adaptive Dependency Learning Neural Network (ADLGNN) that combines neural networks with statistical methods to learn the dependencies between time series and construct a dynamic graph representation.

- It initializes the graph adjacency matrix using efficient statistical methods like correlation, Granger causality, graphical lasso etc. This brings in causal semantics to determine dependencies.

- The static graph is made dynamic over time using a convolutional attention mechanism that reweights the adjacency matrix at each time step based on the observed values.

- Alternating graph convolution and temporal convolution blocks in the model capture both spatial and temporal patterns.

- Additional convolutional attention mechanism also helps improve temporal modeling.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a way to enable GNNs for multivariate forecasting even when no predefined graph is available, by learning the dependencies from the data.

- Computationally efficient approach to construct the dynamic graph structure by combining statistical methods with neural attention.

- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like LSTNet, Temporal Attention LSTM, MTGNN etc. on real-world datasets, demonstrating the benefit of learning and modeling dependencies.

- Ablation studies show benefit of the dynamic graph over static graphs, and using statistical initialization over pure neural approaches for constructing the graph.

In summary, the paper makes GNN based forecasting more widely applicable by developing a method to learn dependency graphs from the data in an efficient neural-statistical hybrid approach.
