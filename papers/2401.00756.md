# [MPRE: Multi-perspective Patient Representation Extractor for Disease   Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00756)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Patient representation learning from electronic health records (EHR) is critical for disease prediction. Existing methods have limitations in fully extracting useful information such as trends, variations, and correlations between them in dynamic features of EHR data. 
- Data sparsity in EHR with sparse and irregular patient visits also limits model performance.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose a Multi-Perspective Patient Representation Extractor (MPRE) framework with three key components:

1. Frequency Transformation Module (FTM): Captures trend and variation information from dynamic features using wavelet decomposition. This enhances feature representation.

2. 2D Multi-Extraction Network (2D MEN): Reshapes the 1D trend and variation into a 2D tensor and applies dilated convolutions to capture correlations between trends and variations across different time spans.  

3. First-Order Difference Attention Mechanism (FODAM): Adaptively calculates contribution of differences in adjacent variations of dynamic features to disease diagnosis.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel MPRE framework to effectively learn patient representations from EHR for disease prediction.

- Introduces FTM to obtain multi-scale time-frequency representations and capture useful trend and variation information from sparse dynamic features.

- Designs 2D MEN to model correlations between trends and variations at multiple time spans to improve representation.

- Develops FODAM to identify important variation differences critical for diagnosis.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of MPRE over strong baselines on two public EHR datasets for disease prediction.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in developing an MPRE framework for learning robust patient representations from sparse, irregular EHR data by capturing complementary perspectives of trends, variations and their correlations. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
