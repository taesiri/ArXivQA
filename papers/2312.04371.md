## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Scalable Network-Aware (SNA) reinforcement learning framework to achieve decentralized inverter-based voltage control in power distribution systems with a large number of distributed energy resources (DERs). The key innovation is leveraging the networked structure to improve scalability. First, the voltage control problem is formulated as a networked Markov decision process which retains network topological information. Then by proving the exponential decay property in such systems, the framework restricts the critics' inputs to local and neighboring observations/actions. This avoids exponential growth of input dimension with number of DERs, resolving scalability issues of conventional methods. Further, a theoretical guarantee bounds the critics' approximation error. For the actors, each actor is trained under the guidance of neighboring critics to optimize local welfare while improving global performance. Case studies demonstrate the SNA framework combined with MASAC and MATD3 algorithms can effectively regulate voltage in systems with 114 DERs, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art. The network-aware, decentralized and flexible nature of this data-driven framework provides a promising modern solution for increasingly complex distribution grids.
