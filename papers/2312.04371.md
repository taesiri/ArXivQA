# [A Scalable Network-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework   for Decentralized Inverter-based Voltage Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04371)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Scalable Network-Aware (SNA) reinforcement learning framework to achieve decentralized inverter-based voltage control in power distribution systems with a large number of distributed energy resources (DERs). The key innovation is leveraging the networked structure to improve scalability. First, the voltage control problem is formulated as a networked Markov decision process which retains network topological information. Then by proving the exponential decay property in such systems, the framework restricts the critics' inputs to local and neighboring observations/actions. This avoids exponential growth of input dimension with number of DERs, resolving scalability issues of conventional methods. Further, a theoretical guarantee bounds the critics' approximation error. For the actors, each actor is trained under the guidance of neighboring critics to optimize local welfare while improving global performance. Case studies demonstrate the SNA framework combined with MASAC and MATD3 algorithms can effectively regulate voltage in systems with 114 DERs, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art. The network-aware, decentralized and flexible nature of this data-driven framework provides a promising modern solution for increasingly complex distribution grids.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a scalable network-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that leverages network structure to achieve decentralized inverter-based voltage control for power grids with a large number of distributed energy resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The voltage control problem is modeled as a networked Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the reasonableness of this approach is justified. The corresponding training environment has been developed, which can directly read standard matpower data to achieve dynamic simulation.

2. The proposed Scalable Network-Aware (SNA) framework improves the scalability which is theoretically guaranteed and experimentally validated. Further, the framework is versatile and can seamlessly integrate with different actor-critic implementations, including multi-agent soft-actor-critic (MASAC), multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3). 

3. With the proposed framework, voltage control for a system containing 114 distributed generations (DGs) (e.g., agents) is successfully realized. This number of agents exceeds what has been achieved in existing literature.

In summary, the key innovation is the SNA framework that leverages network structure information to achieve superior scalability in decentralized inverter-based voltage control using multi-agent reinforcement learning. This allows the method to scale to larger systems with more agents than prior approaches.
