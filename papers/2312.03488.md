# [Modeling Aggregate Downwash Forces for Dense Multirotor Flight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03488)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an investigation into modeling the aggregate downwash forces experienced by a multirotor "sufferer" drone when multiple neighbor drones are flying in close formation. The authors designed a 6-DOF load stand to accurately measure forces on a sufferer drone in various formations with up to 3 neighbors. They explored three main multi-drone formations - Side by Side, Leader Follower, and Stack - and identified chaotic, linear, and nonlinear force interaction regimes. A key finding is that neighbor drone downwash flows merge and contract nonlinearly as distance from the drones increases, invalidating simple linear summation of individual drone forces. To address this, the authors propose a Deep Sets based nonlinear model to capture complex aerodynamic interactions between drone formations. Comparisons show this nonlinear model provides substantially improved force predictions over linear models, reducing errors by up to 46%. The work provides new insights into multi-drone aerodynamic interactions and demonstrates more sophisticated models are necessary to capture collective downwash effects in dense drone swarms.
