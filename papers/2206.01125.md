# [Prefix Conditioning Unifies Language and Label Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01125)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we effectively combine image-caption and image-label (classification) data for vision-language pretraining, in order to improve downstream zero-shot recognition performance? 

The key hypothesis is that simply combining the two datasets naively can negatively affect pretraining, due to differences in image domain coverage and vocabulary between the datasets. The paper proposes a new method called "Prefix Conditioning" to help disentangle the dataset biases and allow the model to learn in a mode tailored to each dataset, while still sharing knowledge between them. The hypothesis is that this approach will improve zero-shot recognition accuracy and robustness compared to naive dataset combination.

In summary, the paper introduces Prefix Conditioning to address the core problem of how to effectively unify image-caption and image-label supervision for better zero-shot recognition performance. The key hypothesis is that Prefix Conditioning can disentangle dataset biases and improve generalization.
