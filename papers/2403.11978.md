# [Pedestrian Tracking with Monocular Camera using Unconstrained 3D Motion   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional monocular visual tracking systems (VTSs) represent the tracked object using a 2D bounding box (BB) in the camera image plane. This lacks information about the object's 3D position which is essential for tasks like path planning and occlusion handling. 
- Methods to estimate 3D position usually require additional sensors like stereo cameras or make simplifying assumptions like the object moving on a known ground plane. This increases cost and limits applicability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a stochastic dynamic model for monocular VTS suitable for tracking pedestrians in 3D without assuming a known ground plane.
- It models the BB extent using known pedestrian height statistics. This allows unconstrained 3D motion while exploiting some prior knowledge.
- BB center motion follows a nearly constant velocity model. Width and height follow autoregressive processes with means and time constants set based on pedestrian data.  
- The nonlinear measurement model handles perspective projection of the 3D BB into the 2D image.
- An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) implementation provides a consistent estimate of the full BB state in 3D.

Main Contributions:
- Novel monocular VTS model for pedestrians that enables unconstrained 3D tracking without requiring ground plane knowledge or additional sensors.
- Careful statistical modeling of BB dynamics in 3D based on pedestrian height statistics. 
- Nonlinear filtering solution using UKF that provides consistent estimates of complete 3D BB state.
- Quantitative evaluation on MOT17 dataset shows improved accuracy over baseline 2D trackers while maintaining consistent estimates.
- Concise parameterization using pedestrian data facilitates model adjustment for different objects or camera views.

In summary, the key novelty is the unconstrained 3D monocular tracking model exploiting pedestrian height statistics. The UKF solution demonstrates significant improvements over prevailing 2D approaches.
