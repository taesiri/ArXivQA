# [Boosting Neural Representations for Videos with a Conditional Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18152)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Boosting Neural Representations for Videos with a Conditional Decoder":

Problem:
Existing implicit neural representations (INRs) for videos have several key limitations: 
1) Intermediate features are not well aligned with target frames during decoding due to reliance on frame index only.  
2) Commonly used GELU activation in upsampling blocks activates limited feature maps.  
3) Reconstruction losses fail to preserve high-frequency details like edges.  
4) Video compression techniques optimize components like pruning, quantization, entropy coding separately leading to sub-optimal efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a universal boosting framework to address the above limitations:

1) A conditional decoder with temporal-aware affine transform (TAT) modules that use frame index to better align intermediate features without normalization. TAT residual blocks enhance alignment and retention.

2) Sinusoidal NeRV-like (SNeRV) blocks that replace GELU with SINE to generate more diverse features. Smaller kernels and more SNeRV blocks later achieve balanced parameter distribution.  

3) Reconstruction loss combining L1, MS-SSIM and frequency losses to preserve intricacies.

4) Consistent entropy minimization technique with network-free Gaussian models and tiny metadata for probability distributions to unify weight and embedding compression.

Main Contributions:

1) Conditional decoder with TAT modules and SNeRV blocks to significantly improve representation capability and accelerate convergence of video INRs.

2) Consistent entropy minimization scheme to eliminate discrepancy between training and inference for optimal rate-distortion performance.

3) Superior performance over baselines in tasks like video regression, compression, inpainting and interpolation demonstrated through comprehensive experiments and ablations.

The paper sets a new benchmark by boosting performance of multiple video INRs using the proposed universal framework.

3) An improved reconstruction loss combining L1, MS-SSIM and frequency domain losses to better preserve high-frequency details in videos.

4) A consistent entropy minimization (CEM) technique for video compression that ensures consistency between training and inference and accurately captures probability distributions.

5) Extensive experiments showing that incorporating these components into existing video implicit neural representations like NeRV, E-NeRV and HNeRV leads to substantial improvements in tasks like video regression, compression, inpainting and interpolation.
