# [SAQIEL: Ultra-Light and Safe Manipulator with Passive 3D Wire Alignment   Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Improving safety of collaborative robots operating around humans requires reducing inertia of moving parts to minimize contact forces during collisions. However, simply locating actuators on base link using tendon-driven mechanisms results in complex routing through joints or friction from sliding tendons in conduits.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a passive 3D wire aligner to enable lightweight and low-friction power transmission from base link actuators to any joint. The aligner automatically aligns wire to fixed path between links regardless of entry angle, enabling simple routing. Aligners placed on pairs of links connect them with straight paths, avoiding intermediate joints. Built-in bearings eliminate sliding friction.

Contributions:
1) Concept of passive 3D wire aligner enabling simple and low-friction tendon-driven power transmission from base.

2) Design of a 7-DOF manipulator called SAQIEL using aligners for all joints. Weighs only 1.5kg (moving parts) versus 4.1kg for human arm, demonstrating substantial weight reduction.

3) Gearless wire winding modules used directly on motors to further reduce friction.

4) Control strategy accounting for both joint encoder and motor encoder feedback due to tendon elasticity.

5) Experiments substantiating payload capacity, high velocity (18.5m/s end effector), accuracy (11mm tracking error), and flexibility in passive/active collisions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel passive 3D wire aligner enabling lightweight and safe manipulator design. SAQIEL demonstrates 60% less weight than human arm along with payload, speed and accuracy capabilities. Future work includes improving transmission efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a passive 3D wire aligner mechanism to achieve an ultra-lightweight and safe 7-DOF manipulator with the motors consolidated on the base link, enabling low inertia and friction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a passive 3D wire aligner, which is a lightweight and low-friction power transmission mechanism for achieving a safe and flexible manipulator. Specifically:

- The passive 3D wire aligner allows power transmission from actuators on the root link across multiple joints to the end effector. This enables a simple and lightweight moving part design.

- Compared to conventional coupled tendon-driven designs, the proposed mechanism uses fewer and smaller pulleys, reducing weight and complexity. The use of wires and needle bearings also minimizes friction. 

- To validate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism, the authors developed a 7-DOF manipulator called SAQIEL with all motors on the root link and 10 sets of passive 3D wire aligners for power transmission. Experiments confirmed that SAQIEL combines lightweight design (1.5kg moving parts), sufficient payload capacity, high velocity, precision, and flexibility/safety.

So in summary, the key contribution is proposing the passive 3D wire aligner mechanism to achieve an extremely lightweight yet powerful manipulator design for safe human-robot interaction. The performance of this mechanism was demonstrated through the SAQIEL manipulator prototype.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Passive 3D wire aligner - A lightweight, low-friction power transmission mechanism proposed in the paper to achieve a lightweight and safe manipulator. It allows transmission of wires across multiple joints.

- Coupled tendon-driven actuation - A technique that employs a redundant number of wires relative to the number of joints to transmit power. It allows removing actuators completely from the moving part. 

- Effective mass - A quantifiable measure to assess robot safety during collisions. Reducing it allows high-speed operation while maintaining safety.

- Muscle Jacobian - A matrix representing the moment arm of each wire at each joint. It is used to convert desired joint torques to target wire tensions.

- SAQIEL - The 7-DoF wire-driven manipulator fabricated in this paper to demonstrate the efficacy of the passive 3D wire aligner. It has lightweight design and low friction in the actuation system.
