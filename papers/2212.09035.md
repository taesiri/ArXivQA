## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on adversarial attacks:

- The key novel contribution of this paper is using the model discrepancy perspective to analyze black-box targeted attacks. The authors provide theoretical justification and generalization error bounds based on model discrepancy, which is lacking in most prior work on adversarial attacks. 

- The proposed M3D attack method is the first to explicitly minimize the maximum model discrepancy when crafting adversarial examples. This makes the examples more transferable and robust to model variations compared to prior generative attack methods like GAP, CDA, and TTP.

- Extensive experiments on ImageNet with different models demonstrate the effectiveness of the M3D approach. It outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, especially when the model architecture differs significantly between the substitute and target model.

- The paper focuses on targeted attacks, while most prior work has looked at untargeted attacks. The theoretical analysis provides new insight specifically for the targeted attack setting.

- The proposed approach follows recent trends in using generative models over iterative methods to craft adversarial examples. Generative approaches tend to have higher efficiency for large datasets.

- Compared to defense techniques, this paper falls into the category of new attack methods. The results against robust and adversarially trained models demonstrate the strength of the proposed attack.

Overall, this paper makes solid theoretical and empirical contributions to the field of adversarial machine learning. The model discrepancy perspective and generalization analysis help better understand transferable black-box attacks. The M3D approach advances state-of-the-art in targeted attack methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the conclusion section:

1. They propose exploring different surrogate loss functions for the model discrepancy term besides the cross-entropy loss used in this work. Other loss functions like Kullback–Leibler divergence or maximum mean discrepancy could potentially further improve the transferability.

2. They suggest exploring different architectures for the generator and discriminators besides the standard CNNs used in this work. More sophisticated generative models like GANs could potentially synthesize even more realistic and imperceptible perturbations. 

3. They propose investigating different adversarial training formulations besides the min-max game used here. For example, exploring collaborative adversarial training methods to make the training more stable.

4. They suggest applying the proposed model discrepancy minimization idea to other transfer-based attack settings besides black-box targeted attack, such as black-box untargeted attack or evasion of adversarial detection methods.

5. They propose exploring the theoretical understanding of transferability in greater depth, such as tighter bounds on the model discrepancy term.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring different loss functions, model architectures, adversarial training schemes, attack settings, and tighter theoretical bounds related to model discrepancy minimization for improving transferable black-box attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the black-box targeted attack problem from the perspective of model discrepancy. The authors first present a generalization error bound for black-box targeted attacks based on model discrepancy, revealing that the attack error depends on the attack error on the substitute model and the model discrepancy between the substitute and target models. Based on this analysis, they propose a new approach called Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy (M3D) attack, which trains a generator to craft adversarial examples that can fool two substitute models with maximum discrepancy. This minimizes the bound on generalization error, improving transferability. Experiments on ImageNet show their method substantially outperforms prior arts, especially when the target model is very different from the substitute model. The key novelty is utilizing model discrepancy theory to improve transferability of targeted attacks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the black-box targeted attack problem from the perspective of model discrepancy. The authors first present a theoretical generalization error bound for black-box targeted attacks. This bound shows that the attack error on a target model depends on two terms: the attack error on the substitute model used to craft the adversarial examples, and the maximum model discrepancy between models in the hypothesis space. 

Based on this analysis, the authors propose a new attack method called Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy (M3D). M3D uses two substitute models which are trained adversarially - one model tries to maximize the discrepancy between their outputs on adversarial examples, while a generator tries to minimize this discrepancy. By doing so, the generator crafts examples that are robust to model variation, improving transferability. Experiments on ImageNet show M3D substantially outperforms prior work, especially when the target model is very different from the substitute model. The method also transfers better to robust and real-world models.

In summary, this paper provides a theoretical justification for model discrepancy being key to transferability, and develops a practical attack method based on this theory that achieves state-of-the-art black-box targeted attack performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a new black-box targeted attack method called Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy (M3D). The key idea is to train a generator G to craft adversarial examples that can fool two substitute models D1 and D2, while simultaneously minimizing the discrepancy between D1 and D2's predictions on the adversarial examples. Specifically, G tries to generate examples that attack D1 and D2 to output a specified target class. Meanwhile, D1 and D2 are trained adversarially to maximize their prediction discrepancy on G's outputs. By playing this min-max game, G learns to craft adversarial examples that are transferable and robust to differences between substitute models. At test time, G can generate adversarial examples to attack an unseen black-box model, since its outputs are insensitive to model variation. Experiments on ImageNet show M3D substantially outperforms prior arts for black-box targeted attack.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of black-box targeted adversarial attacks, where the goal is to craft adversarial examples that can fool a target model into misclassifying inputs as a specified target class, without access to the model parameters or gradients. The key question the paper aims to address is how to create adversarial examples that can transfer more effectively to unknown target models. 

The main contributions are:

1) They provide a theoretical analysis of black-box targeted attacks from a model discrepancy perspective, deriving a generalization error bound that depends on two terms - the attack error on the substitute model and the maximum model discrepancy. 

2) Based on this analysis, they propose a new attack method called Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy (M3D) which trains a generator to craft adversarial examples that can fool two substitute models that are trained to maximize their discrepancy. This allows it to create examples robust to model variation.

3) They demonstrate strong empirical performance, with M3D outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods on attacking various models on ImageNet, including robust and real-world models, showing its ability to create highly transferable adversarial examples.

In summary, the key novelty is introducing a model discrepancy view for black-box attacks and using it to derive an effective new attack that minimizes this discrepancy by design. The result is adversarial examples that transfer much more effectively to diverse target models.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel adversarial attack method called Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy (M3D) for generating highly transferable adversarial examples to attack black-box models. The authors first provide a theoretical analysis by deriving a generalization error bound for black-box targeted attacks based on model discrepancy theory. This bound reveals that the attack success depends on the attack error on a substitute model and the maximum discrepancy between any two models in the hypothesis space.
