# [Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy for Transferable Black-box Targeted   Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09035)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to craft highly transferable adversarial examples for black-box targeted attack. In particular, the authors aim to theoretically analyze and improve the transferability of adversarial examples from the perspective of model discrepancy. 

The key hypothesis is that minimizing the maximum model discrepancy between substitute models when crafting adversarial examples will lead to higher transferability against unknown target models.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a theoretical analysis of black-box targeted attacks from the perspective of model discrepancy, and derives a generalization error bound based on the attack error on the substitute model and the maximum model discrepancy. 

2. Based on the theoretical analysis, it proposes a new black-box targeted attack method called M3D (Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy) that minimizes the maximum discrepancy between two substitute models while attacking them. This results in more transferable adversarial examples.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on ImageNet using different models. The results demonstrate that the proposed M3D approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art black-box targeted attack methods, especially when the black-box model has a large architecture difference from the substitute model.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a theoretical model discrepancy perspective for analyzing and improving black-box targeted attacks, as well as an effective new attack method M3D based on this perspective. The approach is shown to generate more transferable and robust adversarial examples compared to prior arts.
