# [Minimizing Maximum Model Discrepancy for Transferable Black-box Targeted   Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09035)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to craft highly transferable adversarial examples for black-box targeted attack. In particular, the authors aim to theoretically analyze and improve the transferability of adversarial examples from the perspective of model discrepancy. 

The key hypothesis is that minimizing the maximum model discrepancy between substitute models when crafting adversarial examples will lead to higher transferability against unknown target models.
