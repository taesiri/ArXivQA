# [Realistic Scatterer Based Adversarial Attacks on SAR Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02912)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a new physical adversarial attack method called "On-Target Scatter Attack" (OTSA) which perturbs SAR images to fool the classifiers but under a constraint that the false objects as scatterers have to be physically placed on the target itself rather than in the shadow regions or background. The scatterers on the target can cause stronger perturbations and enable better generalization to moving targets in future. To tackle this constrained attack, the authors define a positioning score to force the scatterers on the target during optimization. Specifically, Gaussian kernels are utilized to assign higher scores for positions on the target and lower scores for positions off the target. Based on this score, the OTSA attack is formulated as maximizing the misclassification loss of the classifier while keeping the scatterers on the target. Experiments conducted on 9 SAR classifiers and MSTAR dataset demonstrate significantly increased attack success rates compared to the baseline method without positioning constraint. This constrained physical attack lays the groundwork for more practical and realizable adversarial attacks against SAR automatic target recognition systems with objectives like hiding or disguising vehicles.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a physical adversarial attack method called On-Target Scatterer Attack (OTSA) that generates parameters to guide an adversary in placing scatterers on targets in SAR images to fool classifiers, while enforcing a positioning constraint to ensure feasibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Defining the threat model of scatterer-based physical adversarial attacks on SAR image classifiers, and introducing a constraint on the positioning of the scatterers to ensure the feasibility of the attacks. 

2. Proposing the On-Target Scatterer Attack (OTSA) method with positioning scores based on Gaussian kernels, and formulating it as a maximization problem that can be solved with gradient ascent. 

3. Implementing the OTSA attack and conducting experiments on the MSTAR dataset to attack nine different SAR image classifiers. The results show significant improvements in the success rate compared to the baseline method without the positioning constraint.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a physically realizable adversarial attack on SAR image classifiers by constraining scatterers to be placed on the target, instead of arbitrarily manipulating the SAR images. This is enabled through the use of a positioning score and formulation as an optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OTSA attack.

The paper proposes a physical adversarial attack method called "On-Target Scatterer Attack" (OTSA) to fool SAR image classifiers. It enforces a positioning constraint on the adversarial scatterers, requiring them to be placed on the target rather than in the shadow or background regions. This improves the feasibility of physically executing the attack. The key ideas include formulating an optimization problem with a positioning score to generate the parameters of the adversarial scatterers, and using a scattering model to simulate their appearance in the SAR images. Experiments show OTSA can achieve higher success rates in attacking SAR image classifiers compared to prior work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I came up with about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the proposed OTSA attack address the feasibility limitation of existing adversarial attacks on SAR image classifiers? What are the key ideas for improving feasibility?

2. What is the intuition behind using a positioning score based on Gaussian kernels to enforce the constraint of placing scatterers on the target? How do the properties of Gaussian kernels help?  

3. The paper mentions benefits of constraining scatterers to be on the target region instead of shadow regions. Can you elaborate on those motivations and how the constraint enables future research directions?

4. What are the requirements outlined for the design of the positioning score function $S(x,y)$? How does the proposed formulation in Eq (4) and (5) satisfy those requirements?

5. Explain the gradient ascent optimization procedure for solving the OTSA formulation in Eq (6). What is the intuition for why it can guide scatterers towards the target region?  

6. How does the proposed OTSA attack generalize to different classifiers? What adaptations would be needed to apply it to other datasets beyond MSTAR?

7. What are limitations of using the 2D ASCM for simulating scatterer appearance in SAR images? How can integrating 3D scattering models address those limitations in future work?

8. Can the current OTSA formulation extend to attacking SAR images of moving targets? What components would need to change to enable that?

9. The paper compares with an existing baseline method - what is the key difference in formulation? How does adding the positioning score term improve performance?

10. What other constraints beyond positioning could be incorporated into the OTSA framework to further enhance feasibility? How can additional constraints be represented?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems use machine learning classifiers to recognize objects in SAR images. However, these classifiers have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations to the input images cause the classifiers to misclassify them.

- Most existing attacks directly manipulate the SAR images, which is infeasible in practice. Instead, physical attacks should be considered where the adversary places false scatterer objects near the target to indirectly perturb the SAR image captured by the system.

- Previous physical attacks do not constrain the placement of scatterers, leading to attacks that may place scatterers in unfeasible regions like shadows. Attacks should constrain scatterers to be on the target to improve feasibility.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the On-Target Scatterer Attack (OTSA), a physical attack that constrains scatterers to be positioned on the target object. 

- A positioning score based on Gaussian kernels is introduced to encourage scatterers to stay on the target during optimization. The attack is formulated as maximizing the classifier loss and the positioning scores.

- The optimization problem is solved using gradient ascent to generate parameters describing the shape, size, position, etc. of scatterers that when placed on the target will fool the SAR ATR system.

Main Contributions:
- Defines threat model and positioning constraint for feasible physical attacks on SAR ATR systems.

- Proposes OTSA attack with positioning scores to optimize feasible perturbations by constraining scatterers on target.

- Evaluates OTSA on 9 SAR classifiers over MSTAR dataset, achieving higher attack success rates than baseline physical attack without positioning constraint.

- Lays groundwork for future physical attacks on SAR images of moving targets by constraining perturbations to move along with target.
