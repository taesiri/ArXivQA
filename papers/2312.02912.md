# [Realistic Scatterer Based Adversarial Attacks on SAR Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02912)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a new physical adversarial attack method called "On-Target Scatter Attack" (OTSA) which perturbs SAR images to fool the classifiers but under a constraint that the false objects as scatterers have to be physically placed on the target itself rather than in the shadow regions or background. The scatterers on the target can cause stronger perturbations and enable better generalization to moving targets in future. To tackle this constrained attack, the authors define a positioning score to force the scatterers on the target during optimization. Specifically, Gaussian kernels are utilized to assign higher scores for positions on the target and lower scores for positions off the target. Based on this score, the OTSA attack is formulated as maximizing the misclassification loss of the classifier while keeping the scatterers on the target. Experiments conducted on 9 SAR classifiers and MSTAR dataset demonstrate significantly increased attack success rates compared to the baseline method without positioning constraint. This constrained physical attack lays the groundwork for more practical and realizable adversarial attacks against SAR automatic target recognition systems with objectives like hiding or disguising vehicles.
