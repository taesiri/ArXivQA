# [Towards Effective Multiple-in-One Image Restoration: A Sequential and   Prompt Learning Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
While single image restoration (IR) tasks like super-resolution, deblurring etc have seen great progress, training a single model to handle multiple IR tasks still remains challenging. This paper terms this as the multiple-in-one (MiO) IR problem and identifies two main challenges:
1) Optimizing diverse objectives: The multiple IR tasks have different objectives which causes training instability when optimized together.  
2) Task Adaptation: The model needs to classify the degradation type and perform the right restoration.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two strategies to address the above challenges:

1) Sequential Learning: Instead of mixing all data, tasks are learned incrementally, one after the other. This provides better optimization by using previous tasks as pre-training for later ones.

2) Prompt Learning: Additional input/extracted information is used to guide the network to understand the IR task type. Two methods are explored - explicit prompt uses extra input to provide task type, adaptive prompt extracts info from the input image.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates the MiO IR problem with 7 tasks - super-resolution, deblurring, denoising etc. Identifies key training challenges.

- Proposes simple yet effective sequential and prompt learning strategies to address optimization and adaptation challenges. Shows significant quantitative and qualitative improvements.

- Demonstrates generalizability of strategies by testing on multiple CNN and Transformer architectures. Also shows improved representation learning and robustness.

- Benchmark of MiO performance for common architectures. Enhances recent state-of-the-art method PromptIR. 

- The problem formulation and learning strategies could facilitate future research on training generalizable IR models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes sequential learning and prompt learning strategies to train a single image restoration model to effectively handle multiple tasks by addressing the challenges of optimizing diverse objectives and adapting to different tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It formulates the multiple-in-one (MiO) image restoration (IR) problem, which aims to process multiple IR tasks using a single model. The paper identifies two main challenges of MiO IR: optimizing diverse objectives of different tasks and adapting the model to different tasks. 

2) It proposes two effective and complementary strategies to address the above challenges - sequential learning and prompt learning. Sequential learning incrementally trains the model on individual tasks to optimize diverse objectives. Prompt learning uses additional inputs or adaptively extracted information to help the model adapt to different tasks.

3) Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that both sequential and prompt learning significantly improve performance over mixed training baseline for CNN and Transformer networks. The two strategies also supplement each other.

4) The paper presents a benchmark for common backbone networks on the proposed MiO IR formulation. It also shows the proposed strategies can enhance recent methods like PromptIR.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying the challenges in MiO IR and proposing simple yet effective sequential and prompt learning strategies to address them. The strategies generalize across networks and boost performance.
