# [Accelerating Federated Learning by Selecting Beneficial Herd of Local   Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that trains models on decentralized data located on user devices. This helps with data privacy and reduces communication costs.
- However, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of user data can negatively impact model convergence, requiring more communication rounds or even preventing convergence. 
- Therefore, mitigating the effects of non-IID data to accelerate FL convergence is an important challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new federated learning optimization strategy called "BHerd" that selects only a subset of "beneficial" local gradients to reduce the impact of non-IID data.
- The key idea is to use a herding algorithm to rank the local gradients based on their distance to the average gradient. Only the top ranked "beneficial" gradients are selected.
- Specifically, BHerd minimizes the difference between the selected gradients and the full gradient average. This characterizes the entire gradient distribution with just a subset to mitigate outlier gradients.

Contributions:
- The paper formally defines the BHerd optimization strategy and proves theoretically that it converges below a bounded rate.
- Extensive experiments on CNN and SVM models using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets validate that BHerd accelerates federated model convergence across IID and non-IID data distributions.
- Comparisons show BHerd selects beneficial gradients more effectively than prior GraB algorithm and also improves state-of-the-art methods like FedNova and SCAFFOLD.
- Analysis provides insights into how the selection ratio parameter and other hyperparameters impact performance.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in introducing and validating a new gradient selection strategy called BHerd to accelerate the convergence of federated learning models, especially in the presence of non-IID data.
