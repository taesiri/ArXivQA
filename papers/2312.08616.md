# [A Generalized Neural Diffusion Framework on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08616)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper proposes a generalized diffusion graph framework consisting of a diffusion equation and a fidelity term that establishes connections between the diffusion process and a variety of graph neural networks (GNNs). The framework shows that many existing GNNs correspond to a first-order diffusion equation. The authors then empirically discover that node labels exhibit a monophily property, whereby second-order neighbors of nodes are more likely to share the same label without requiring first-order neighbor similarity. Motivated by this, the authors propose a novel high-order diffusion equation that considers both first and second-order diffusion. They theoretically show that it corresponds to second-order random walks. Based on this diffusion equation, they derive a High-order Diffusion GNN (HiD-Net) that is more robust and works well on both homophily and heterophily graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art graph diffusion networks as well as established GNN baselines like GCN and GAT on tasks like node classification. The proposed framework not only unifies many existing GNNs but also suggests potential for designing novel GNN variants based on higher-order diffusion equations.
