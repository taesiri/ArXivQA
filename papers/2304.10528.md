# [Generalizing Neural Human Fitting to Unseen Poses With Articulated SE(3)   Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10528)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can neural networks be made equivariant/invariant to articulated transformations like those of human bodies, in order to improve generalization to unseen poses when fitting a parametric model like SMPL to point cloud data of humans? The key ideas proposed to address this are:- Using part-based equivariance instead of global equivariance, to account for the articulated structure of the human body.- Disentangling shape and pose by making shape-invariant and pose-equivariant networks.- Discretizing the rotation group and representing rotations as linear combinations of these discrete elements. This allows casting pose regression as a weight prediction problem.- Leveraging the permutation equivariance of self-attention to efficiently process part-based equivariant features while preserving equivariance. The overall hypothesis seems to be that by properly integrating equivariance and invariance properties into the network architecture, the model can generalize much better to unseen poses when regressing SMPL parameters from point clouds. The results presented seem to confirm this hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is how to design a network architecture that disentangles pose and shape in an equivariant way, to achieve robust generalization to new articulated poses for human model fitting from point clouds. The core ideas are part-based equivariance, discrete rotations, and self-attention.
