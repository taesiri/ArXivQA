# [Zero- and Few-Shots Knowledge Graph Triplet Extraction with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01954)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a pipeline to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on the task of triplet extraction (TE) from text in zero-shot and few-shot settings. The pipeline dynamically gathers contextual triplets or sentence-triplet pairs from a knowledge base (KB) that are relevant to the input sentence, and includes this contextual information in the LLM prompt. Experiments showed that adding just 5 contextual triplets substantially improved LLM performance on TE over using the prompt alone, making even smaller LLM models competitive with some classical NLP baselines. Further gains were achieved by instead providing 5 relevant sentence-triplet examples. There is evidence that TE performance correlates more strongly with the quality of the retrieved KB context than LLM scale. While still below state-of-the-art classical models, prompting LLMs with relevant KB context makes them much more capable on TE in low-resource scenarios compared to relying solely on the prompt. The paper recommends focusing efforts on improving KB quality and retrieval over pursuing ever-larger LLMs for advancing TE.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the task of triplet extraction (TE) from text, where the goal is to extract (subject, predicate, object) triplets that represent the meaning of the text. Current state-of-the-art TE models rely on task-specific supervision, limiting their generalization capabilities. The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can perform TE in zero-shot and few-shot settings, using knowledge base (KB) information to aid the models. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a pipeline to perform TE using LLMs aided with KB context. For a given input text, relevant contextual triplets and (sentence, triplets) pairs are retrieved from a KB dynamically and provided to the LLM through prompting. The KB context gives hints about expected entities, relations, and patterns for TE. Various LLMs like GPT-2, Falcon, LLaMA, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are tested on WebNLG and NYT datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Show that LLMs struggle with TE in zero-shot setting but adding just 2-5 examples helps reach competitive scores. Additional KB triplets provide further improvements.
- Propose a pipeline to dynamically retrieve contextual KB information and provide it to LLM prompting for TE. KB sentence-triplet examples are most informative.  
- Demonstrate LLMs can match or exceed performance of some classical BiLSTM baselines with KB aid. But significant gap remains compared to state-of-the-art models.
- Analyze impact of retrieved KB context quality on TE performance. Results suggest investing in better KBs over bigger models may be more worthwhile. 
- Performance scales linearly with KB context quality but only logarithmically with LLM size, for the TE task.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the promise of combining large language models with knowledge base information to perform knowledge extraction tasks like triplet extraction in low resource scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper tests the performance of various large language models on zero-shot and few-shot knowledge graph triplet extraction from text, finding that providing additional context from a knowledge base significantly improves results, though fine-tuned models still outperform.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a pipeline to augment large language models (LLMs) with knowledge base (KB) information to improve their performance on zero-shot and few-shot triplet extraction. Specifically:

- They dynamically gather contextual triplets and sentence-triplet examples from a KB that are relevant to the input sentence. This additional context is provided to the LLM prompt to aid triplet extraction.

- They demonstrate that adding KB context substantially improves LLM performance on zero-shot and few-shot triplet extraction, making even small LLMs competitive with classical fully-trained models on certain benchmarks. 

- They perform an analysis showing LLM accuracy has a strong linear correlation with the quality of the retrieved KB context, suggesting improving the KB and retriever could be more impactful than using larger LLMs.

- They find LLM performance scales logarithmically with model size but linearly with KB quality, indicating resources may be better invested in improving KB coverage than pursuing ever-larger models.

In summary, the key innovation is using dynamic KB retrieval to provide useful context that aids LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot knowledge extraction scenarios.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose dynamically gathering contextual information from a knowledge base (KB) to augment large language models (LLMs) for the task of triplet extraction. What are some potential ways this contextual information could be further enriched to provide even more useful context to the LLM?

2. The simple sentence encoder MiniLM is used to embed triplets from the KB to allow retrieving relevant triplets based on sentence similarity. What other more sophisticated sentence encoders could be explored? What potential benefits or limitations might they have? 

3. The authors find that randomly sampling triplets from the retrieved context is surprisingly competitive with the LLM's performance when little context is provided. What does this suggest about the generalization capability of LLMs on this task and datasets? How could the datasets be revised to provide a more realistic test?

4. It is found that the LLM's performance scales linearly with the probability of finding the correct triplet in the retrieved context. However, performance only scales logarithmically with LLM model size. What are the implications of this? Would it be better to invest in larger models or better knowledge bases and retrievers?

5. The authors exclude the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 results on NYT dataset as outliers. What might explain their poor performance compared to other LLMs? Does it relate to their instructed training? How could this be further analyzed? 

6. What other prompt designs could be explored beyond the base prompt used in most experiments? Would a prompt optimized separately for each LLM lead to better results?

7. The simple triplet embeddings used for retrieval could likely be improved. What other techniques from information retrieval could be adopted to better identify relevant contextual triplets? 

8. How well does the pipeline generalize to other datasets? What types of sentences or relations might it struggle with? How could the approach be adapted to improve generalization?

9. For the few-shot setting, only up to 8 sentence-triplet examples are tested from the KB. Would further gains be achieved by including even more contextual examples relevant to the input sentence?

10. The authors propose that improving the KB and retriever may be more effective than using larger LLMs. How could this hypothesis be further tested? What metrics beside performance on these two datasets would better evaluate the value of different improvements?
