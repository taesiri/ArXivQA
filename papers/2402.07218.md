# [Sensor Misalignment-tolerant AUV Navigation with Passive DoA and Doppler   Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- AUVs rely on dead reckoning for navigation, but position estimates drift over time. Acoustic positioning systems like LBL and USBL can bound errors but have downsides (cost, time to deploy LBL; energy use for USBL).
- Recently, passive acoustic direction of arrival (DoA) measurements have been used for AUV navigation without needing ranging measurements. However, prior work does not account for sensor misalignment between the acoustic array and attitude sensor, which can hurt navigation accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- A new approach for simultaneous AUV navigation, acoustic beacon localization, and sensor alignment using only passive DoA and Doppler measurements. 
- Uses an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for efficiency.
- Initially localizes beacon and estimates sensor misalignment using a nonlinear least squares method over a short time window. This provides a good initialization for the UKF.
- Outlier rejection utilized to handle noise - RANSAC for initialization, simple thresholding for UKF.

Main Contributions:
- Allows online beacon localization and sensor alignment without needing two-way acoustic communications. More robust to misalignment than prior art.
- Incorporates Doppler measurements in addition to DoA, which helps bridge DVL outages and improves accuracy when elevation angle is shallow.
- Demonstrates approach in simulation and preliminary field tests. Method is tolerant to misalignment and robust to loss of DVL measurements.

In summary, the paper presents a passive navigation solution for AUVs that provides simultaneous localization, beacon positioning, and sensor calibration. It is computationally efficient, resilient to noise, and relaxes some assumptions made in prior work. Simulation and real-world tests showcase the capability.
