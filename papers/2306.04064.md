# [Transferable Adversarial Robustness for Categorical Data via Universal   Robust Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04064)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we create adversarial robustness for machine learning models used on tabular datasets with categorical features, and especially for non-neural network models like tree ensembles?The key points are:- Most prior work on adversarial robustness focuses on images and neural networks. But many real-world tasks rely on tabular data with categorical features, and use non-neural network models like tree ensembles.- Making tree ensembles robust is challenging due to their discrete, non-differentiable nature. Prior techniques for robustness don't apply well.- The authors propose a method to train a neural network to produce "universal robust embeddings" tailored to categorical data. These embeddings can then be transferred to tree ensembles to make them robust without needing adversarial training.So in summary, the main research question is how to achieve adversarial robustness for important real-world tasks that use tabular data and models like tree ensembles, overcoming the challenges posed by categorical features and non-differentiable models. The key contribution is a method to create transferable robust embeddings using a bilevel optimization framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing methods to improve the robustness of models trained on categorical data, for both deep neural networks and tree-based models like random forests and gradient boosted trees. 2. Developing a new adversarial training algorithm for neural networks that can handle complex and heterogeneous constraints arising from categorical data. This algorithm is based on continuous relaxation and projections.3. Introducing the concept of "universal robust embeddings" which allow transferring robustness from neural networks to other types of models like decision trees. The key ideas here are bilevel optimization to learn robust first-layer embeddings and an embedding merging algorithm.  4. Constructing a new benchmark for evaluating robustness in tabular data tasks where the adversary is constrained realistically by financial costs rather than simplistic Lp norms.5. Empirically demonstrating on this benchmark that the proposed techniques provide significantly improved robustness over prior methods on tabular datasets with categorical features.In summary, the key novelty seems to be in developing methods tailored to the unique challenges of achieving adversarial robustness for categorical data and tabular tasks, via cost-based threat modeling, continuous relaxations, universal robust embeddings, and appropriate benchmarking. The results demonstrate these techniques are effective for boosting robustness of neural networks and decision trees on real-world tabular datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes methods to enhance the robustness of machine learning models for tabular data with categorical features, both for deep networks and tree ensembles, through adversarial training to create universal robust embeddings that can be transferred between model types.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in adversarial robustness for tabular data:- The paper nicely motivates the problem and need for adversarial robustness in tabular data, which is an important area that has received less attention compared to images. It argues that many real-world applications like fraud detection rely on tabular data and tree-based models rather than deep networks on images.- The paper tackles two key challenges: 1) handling discrete categorical features in tabular data, and 2) achieving robustness for non-differentiable tree-based models commonly used for tabular data. These are important open problems that have not been sufficiently addressed.- For handling categorical features, the paper proposes a practical adversarial training method based on continuous relaxation and projections. This appears novel compared to prior work like Wang et al. that uses combinatorial attacks. The relaxation technique seems principled.- For tree ensemble robustness, generating robust embeddings and transferring them is an interesting idea. The bilevel optimization framework to produce the embeddings is different from standard adversarial training.- The proposed benchmark for evaluating tabular robustness based on realistic financial costs is valuable. Most prior work uses simplistic Lp norms. The benchmark facilitates more meaningful comparisons.- The results demonstrate clear improvements over prior art like Wang et al. on both accuracy and efficiency. The gains are substantial on large real-world datasets.Overall, the paper makes nice contributions on an important open problem. The techniques for handling categorical features and transferring robustness to trees seem novel. The results validate the value of the proposals. The benchmark is also an asset to drive further progress.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring other methods for adversarial training on categorical/tabular data beyond alternating minimization. The authors mention that standard adversarial training struggles to produce optimal first layer embeddings, so developing new approaches tailored for tabular data could be beneficial.- Considering different threat models and adversarial capabilities beyond the cost-based model proposed here. The authors focus on cost-based perturbations but mention other constraints like semantics could be relevant. Expanding the threat models studied would allow more comprehensive evaluation.- Developing algorithms to directly train non-differentiable models like random forests in an adversarially robust manner, instead of relying on transferring robustness from neural nets. The authors' embedding transfer approach seems promising but training tree ensembles end-to-end could further improve robustness.- Experimenting with the proposed methods on a wider range of tabular datasets. The authors evaluate on a few datasets they argue are suitable for robustness but testing on more real-world tasks could reveal new challenges.- Further theoretical analysis of the algorithms. The authors provide an empirical evaluation but do not analyze convergence guarantees or other theoretical properties of their adversarial training and embedding procedures.- Considering other potential applications of robust categorical embeddings beyond robustness. The authors focus on adversarial robustness but these embeddings could be useful for other tasks like transfer learning.In summary, the main suggestions are developing new tailored algorithms for tabular data, expanding the threat models considered, directly training non-differentiable models, evaluation on more datasets, theoretical analysis, and exploring other applications of the robust embeddings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes methods to improve the robustness of machine learning models trained on tabular datasets containing categorical features. It presents a practical adversarial training algorithm for neural networks that can handle complex constraints and heterogeneous costs for manipulating categorical features. It also introduces a bilevel optimization framework to produce universal robust embeddings from the first layer of a neural network that can then be transferred to tree-based models like XGBoost to make them robust without needing adversarial training. On three real-world tabular datasets related to financial prediction tasks, the proposed techniques are shown to outperform prior approaches under threat models that more accurately capture an adversary's capabilities based on financial costs. The improved robustness is demonstrated on both neural networks and tree ensembles while maintaining high clean accuracy. The paper helps advance robustness research for the important domain of tabular data where models like random forests and gradient boosting prevail over deep learning.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes new methods to improve the robustness of models trained on tabular data with categorical features, for both neural networks and tree-based models like random forests. Tabular data with categorical features is common in many high-stakes applications like fraud detection and medical diagnosis. However, most prior work on adversarial robustness focuses on continuous features and image data. The paper makes three main contributions. First, it proposes a practical adversarial training algorithm that can handle complex constraints needed to accurately model an adversary's capabilities on categorical data. This algorithm is based on a continuous relaxation and projection methods. Second, the paper introduces an approach to generate "universal robust embeddings" from a neural network that can be transferred to tree-based models to make them robust without needing adversarial training. The key ideas are a bilevel optimization framework and an embedding merging algorithm. Third, the paper constructs a benchmark to evaluate robustness for tabular data tasks where the adversary is realistically constrained by monetary costs. Experiments on this benchmark with three tabular datasets show the proposed methods significantly outperform prior approaches for both neural networks and random forests.In summary, this paper offers new techniques to achieve adversarial robustness on tabular data with categorical features, for both neural networks and tree ensembles. It proposes more realistic threat modeling, algorithms for robust training tailored to categorical data, and methods to transfer robustness from neural networks to tree models. Experiments demonstrate the value of these contributions compared to prior work.
