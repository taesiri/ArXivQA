# [Hierarchical Skip Decoding for Efficient Autoregressive Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14919)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autoregressive decoding is commonly used for text generation with pre-trained language models, but it is computationally expensive during inference. 
- Reducing computational workload while maintaining text quality is a major challenge.

Method: 
- The paper proposes a novel decoding strategy called Hierarchical Skip Decoding (HSD).  
- HSD adaptively skips transformer layers in a hierarchical manner based on the current sequence length. This allocates computation dynamically.
- Unlike other methods requiring additional components, HSD is a flexible plug-and-play strategy easily applied to any pre-trained language model.

Experiments:
- HSD is evaluated on 5 text generation datasets with two models - GPT-2 and Phi-2.
- It significantly outperforms existing methods like CALM and SkipDecode in balancing efficiency and quality.  
- With ~50% of layers skipped, HSD sustains 90% of text quality compared to full autoregressive decoding.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of HSD that combines hierarchical layer skipping and scheduled computation budget for efficient text generation.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating HSD's superior performance over competitive methods. 
- A flexible plug-and-play strategy to reduce inference cost of autoregressive models while maintaining high text quality.

In summary, the paper proposes HSD, a novel decoding approach for efficient text generation that hierarchically skips layers based on sequence length. Experiments on multiple models and datasets show HSD maintains high quality with up to 50% layer reduction versus full autoregressive decoding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Hierarchical Skip Decoding (HSD), a novel decoding strategy that adaptively skips transformer layers in a hierarchical manner to reduce computation while maintaining text quality for efficient autoregressive text generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel decoding strategy called Hierarchical Skip Decoding (HSD) for efficient autoregressive text generation with pre-trained language models. Specifically:

1) HSD combines the concepts of hierarchical layer skipping and scheduled computational budget to adaptively skip decoder layers based on the current sequence length. This reduces computational workload while allocating computation resources in a flexible manner.

2) HSD is a plug-and-play strategy that can be easily applied to any pre-trained autoregressive language model, without needing to modify the original model architecture. It is compatible with existing confidence score based early exiting methods.

3) Comprehensive experiments on 5 text generation datasets and 2 pre-trained models (GPT-2 and Phi-2) demonstrate HSD's superiority over competitive methods in balancing efficiency and text quality. With ~50% layer skipping, HSD sustains 90% of text quality compared to full decoding, outperforming other approaches.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective and easy-to-deploy decoding strategy to reduce the computational cost of autoregressive text generation while maintaining strong performance. This facilitates the adoption of large pre-trained LMs in practical applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical skip decoding (HSD) strategy for efficient text generation. Can you explain in detail how HSD works and how it is different from prior methods like CALM and SkipDecode? 

2. The key idea behind HSD is to skip layers in the decoder in a hierarchical manner based on sequence length. What is the intuition behind this hierarchical skipping strategy? How does it help balance efficiency and text quality compared to uniformly skipping layers?

3. HSD incorporates both scheduled skipping and hierarchical skipping. What are the benefits of combining these two techniques? How do they complement each other?

4. One advantage of HSD is that it does not require any modification of the pre-trained language model itself. What makes HSD a flexible plug-and-play approach? How easy is it to deploy with existing models compared to methods like DeeBERT?

5. The paper evaluates HSD on multiple datasets spanning different text generation tasks. What does this wide range of experiments indicate about the versatility and robustness of the approach? How well does it perform across tasks?

6. For the CNN/DM summarization dataset, HSD is able to preserve 90% of text quality while skipping almost 50% of layers. Why is this a significant result? What does it imply about the efficiency vs quality trade-off?  

7. How sensitive is HSD to the choice of hyperparameter values for s, min, and max? What seems to be a reasonable range to use based on the results? How could the hyperparameters be tuned for a new model or dataset?

8. The quality metrics used to evaluate HSD include ROUGE, BLEU and BERTScore. Why is it important to consider multiple automatic evaluation metrics? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each one? 

9. The results show that HSD outperforms SkipDecode given the same average number of decoder layers used. What specifically accounts for HSD's better performance with similar efficiency?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on text generation tasks. Do you think HSD could be applied effectively to other NLP tasks involving autoregressive transformers like machine translation or question answering? Why or why not?
