# [Analysis of Multidomain Abstractive Summarization Using Salience   Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Automatic text summarization is important to distill key information from large amounts of text data. However, existing abstractive summarization methods can struggle with accurately capturing salient content, coherence, and faithfulness.  

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes using the SEASON abstractive summarization technique which integrates salience allocation to guide the model's attention during summarization. Specifically, it adds a salience prediction module in the encoder to predict the salience of each sentence. This salience information is then integrated into the decoder via a salience-aware cross-attention mechanism to focus on the most salient content when generating summaries.

Main Contributions:

1) Evaluates SEASON on 3 datasets: CNN/Dailymail news articles, SAMSum dialog summaries, and financial news Event-Driven Trading (EDT) articles.

2) Compares SEASON to Transformer models - BART, PEGASUS, ProphetNet - fine-tuned on the 3 datasets.

3) Analysis using ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore and MoverScore shows SEASON outperforms other models, especially on the financial EDT dataset.

4) Qualitative analysis of generated summaries demonstrates SEASON's ability to produce more accurate, coherent and relevant summaries with less hallucination compared to other models.

5) Provides insight into using salience allocation to improve abstractive summarization across diverse text genres. Demonstrates potential for extensions to scholarly document summarization, question answering and chatbot tasks.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in leveraging salience prediction to enhance abstractive summarization faithfulness and coherence across news, dialogue and domain-specific texts. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples validate the efficacy of the proposed SEASON technique.
