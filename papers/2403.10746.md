# [Vector search with small radiuses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dominant metric for evaluating vector search is top-k retrieval (k-NN), but this is distantly related to end-to-end performance when search is used in a full system.
- More relevant task is range search, where all vectors within a radius are returned, as this maps better to applications where a decision is made based on search results. 
- However, evaluating range search is difficult due to boundary effects and varying density of neighbors. 

Proposed Solution:
- Derive a principled metric called RSM to evaluate range search in a way that correlates with end-task performance. 
- RSM is based on modeling the probability that a retrieved vector will be a true positive match after downstream filtering.
- Allows benchmarking of approximate search techniques without requiring exhaustive annotation.

Experiments & Observations:
- Study an image dataset with geometrical verification as second stage filter.
- For inverted file indexes, visiting fewer clusters gives similar RSM, unlike k-NN search.
- Vector compression has less impact on RSM than k-NN.
- Conclude that methods optimized for k-NN retrieval are not best for range search.
- RSM provides an efficient way to evaluate range search quality for bulk processing.

Main Contributions:
- RSM metric to evaluate range search correlating with end-performance
- Analysis showing range search has different tradeoffs vs. k-NN search
- Guidelines for optimizing vector search for range queries and bulk processing
