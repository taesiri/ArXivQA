# [PromptBench: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models   on Adversarial Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04528)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How robust are large language models to adversarial attacks on prompts? 

The authors introduce a new benchmark called PromptBench to systematically evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) when exposed to adversarial prompts. The key hypothesis appears to be that LLMs today lack robustness to adversarial perturbations in the prompts/instructions provided to guide their behavior, making them vulnerable in potential downstream applications.

To test this hypothesis, the paper details the design of PromptBench which allows dynamic generation of adversarial prompts using various attack techniques targeting different linguistic levels (character, word, sentence, semantic). It then leverages PromptBench to attack prompts across diverse tasks with multiple LLMs. 

The central goal is to quantify the vulnerability of contemporary LLMs to these adversarial prompts, analyze the factors contributing to the lack of robustness using attention visualization and word frequency analysis, and provide guidance to improve prompt engineering and model training for enhanced robustness.

In summary, the key research question is assessing and explaining the robustness (or lack thereof) of large language models against adversarial attacks targeting the textual prompts/instructions provided to the models. PromptBench offers a comprehensive framework to evaluate this question.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem the authors are trying to address is evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs) when subjected to adversarial perturbations in the prompts/instructions provided to the models. 

Specifically, the paper introduces a benchmark called "PromptBench" to assess how robust different LLMs are to various types of adversarial attacks applied to the prompts, rather than just attacking the input text samples. The motivation is that prompts serve as critical instructions that guide LLMs, so understanding their robustness is vital.

The paper argues that existing adversarial evaluations for NLP models have focused on attacking the input texts but overlooked the sensitivity of models to variations in the prompts. So PromptBench aims to provide a systematic way to evaluate the adversarial robustness of prompts across different models, tasks, datasets and types of attacks.

In summary, the key research question is: How robust are current LLMs when faced with adversarial perturbations in the prompts/instructions provided to them across diverse tasks? PromptBench offers a benchmark to evaluate this in a comprehensive manner.
