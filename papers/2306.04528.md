# [PromptBench: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models   on Adversarial Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04528)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How robust are large language models to adversarial attacks on prompts? The authors introduce a new benchmark called PromptBench to systematically evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) when exposed to adversarial prompts. The key hypothesis appears to be that LLMs today lack robustness to adversarial perturbations in the prompts/instructions provided to guide their behavior, making them vulnerable in potential downstream applications.To test this hypothesis, the paper details the design of PromptBench which allows dynamic generation of adversarial prompts using various attack techniques targeting different linguistic levels (character, word, sentence, semantic). It then leverages PromptBench to attack prompts across diverse tasks with multiple LLMs. The central goal is to quantify the vulnerability of contemporary LLMs to these adversarial prompts, analyze the factors contributing to the lack of robustness using attention visualization and word frequency analysis, and provide guidance to improve prompt engineering and model training for enhanced robustness.In summary, the key research question is assessing and explaining the robustness (or lack thereof) of large language models against adversarial attacks targeting the textual prompts/instructions provided to the models. PromptBench offers a comprehensive framework to evaluate this question.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Expanding the tasks and datasets evaluated in PromptBench. The authors acknowledge that the current set of tasks and datasets is limited, so expanding to more diverse tasks and datasets would allow for a broader understanding of model vulnerabilities. - Evaluating more advanced prompt engineering techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT). The authors note it is difficult to do automated evaluation with these methods currently. Further research could explore evaluating them.- Incorporating more models into the benchmark, such as GPT-4 and other latest LLMs that were unavailable for this study. Evaluating more models would provide additional perspectives.- Exploring improved fine-tuning methods to enhance model robustness. The authors found models like T5 and UL2 fine-tuned on large datasets showed better robustness, motivating more research on fine-tuning strategies.- Developing defense strategies against adversarial prompts, such as input preprocessing to detect adversaries, using low-quality data during pre-training, and improved prompt engineering techniques.- Conducting evaluations on full datasets rather than samples to gain more comprehensive insights. The current sampling was required for feasibility but future work could assess entire datasets.In summary, the main future directions are expanding the tasks, datasets, models, and defense strategies evaluated, while also exploring advanced prompt engineering techniques and more exhaustive evaluations. The overall goal is to further advance the understanding of adversarial prompts and model robustness.
