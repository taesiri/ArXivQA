# [Conformal Prediction in Multi-User Settings: An Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05195)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates conformal prediction, a method for quantifying prediction uncertainty, in multi-user systems where data is collected from different users. Conformal models provide prediction sets rather than single predictions, with guarantees on the probability the true class is included. The authors compare performance across mixed, user-independent, user-dependent, and user-calibrated models on 4 real-world multi-user datasets, using conformal and non-conformal metrics. They propose visualizations like co-occurrence matrices and graphs to analyze prediction set patterns and relationships to non-conformal confusion matrices. Key findings are that random forests produce the smallest conformal prediction sets across models, the commonly-used mixed model overestimates performance versus a more realistic user-independent model, and calibrating with target user data, even if small in quantity, can significantly improve coverage guarantees. The paper overall advocates evaluating interactive systems using conformal prediction to provide reliability alongside accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper conducts an extensive evaluation of different multi-user validation strategies within the conformal prediction framework across 4 datasets, analyzing performance measures, proposing visualizations of prediction sets, and finding that random forests achieve the best performance while k-nearest neighbors produce the largest sets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. The authors conducted extensive experiments using four real-world datasets to investigate the influence of different multi-user evaluation strategies on the quality of conformal and traditional models in terms of conformal performance measures. 

2. They introduced a new evaluation strategy called "user-calibrated model" which uses data from the target user to calibrate the conformal model. Based on the experiments, they found that a mixed-model overestimates the performance compared to a user-independent model, which is what would be experienced in real life.

3. They proposed the use of matrix and graph based visualizations to analyze conformal prediction sets and compare the results between traditional and conformal models. They also proposed a multiset-enumerating chart to overcome limitations in visualizing n-ary relations between prediction sets.

So in summary, the main contributions are: experiments investigating different evaluation strategies, introduction of a user-calibrated model, and novel visualizations for analyzing and comparing prediction sets.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models for multi-user systems (where data comes from multiple users) are typically evaluated without distinguishing between users, which leads to overestimating performance. 
- Existing evaluation strategies for multi-user systems mostly focus on overall performance metrics rather than prediction uncertainty or guarantees for individual predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate conformal prediction framework for multi-user systems using different strategies: mixed model, user-dependent model, user-independent model, and proposed user-calibrated model.
- Conformal prediction provides prediction sets that contain true label with probability 1-Îµ to quantify uncertainty.
- Propose visualizations like co-occurrence matrix, co-occurrence graph, zero-diagonal confusion matrix, and multiset-enumerating charts to analyze prediction sets.

Contributions:
- Conduct extensive experiments on 4 real-world multi-user datasets to compare choice of strategies on conformal performance measures.
- Introduce user-calibrated model that first trains on all users' data, then calibrates on target user's data.
- Find RF produces smallest prediction sets while conformal coverage criteria is met for user-calibrated model despite using less calibration data.  
- Reject stated hypotheses about no performance differences between strategies.
- Demonstrate proposed visualizations show relationships between prediction sets and singleton predictions.

In summary, the paper evaluates conformal prediction for multi-user systems using different strategies and proposed evaluations. The experiments and visualizations provide insights into differences in reliability and uncertainty across strategies. The introduced user-calibrated model also shows potential for improved performance.
