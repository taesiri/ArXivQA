# [PEPSI++: Fast and Lightweight Network for Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09010)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a fast and lightweight inpainting network that can generate high-quality results. Specifically, the paper proposes two novel networks called PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI to overcome the limitations of prior inpainting methods like coarse-to-fine networks, in terms of speed and hardware costs while maintaining or improving inpainting performance. 

The key hypotheses tested in this paper are:

1) A single shared encoder with parallel decoding paths (coarse and inpainting) can be trained jointly to extract useful features and generate good inpainting results, eliminating the need for stacked coarse and refinement networks. 

2) Novel rate-adaptive dilated convolutional layers that share weights but produce dynamic features can effectively capture global context with fewer parameters, leading to a lightweight Diet-PEPSI model.

3) A region ensemble discriminator (RED) that computes adversarial loss for each pixel can handle irregular mask shapes for real applications.

The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by comparing the proposed PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI to prior inpainting methods on metrics like quality, speed, and model size. The results generally confirm the hypotheses, showing faster and lighter networks while maintaining or improving inpainting accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new image inpainting network called PEPSI (Parallel Extended-Decoder Path for Semantic Inpainting). The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing a parallel decoder architecture with a shared encoder. This allows jointly training a coarse path and an inpainting path to improve results while reducing computational complexity compared to prior two-stage approaches.

- The coarse path produces a rough inpainting to help train the shared encoder. The inpainting path uses a contextual attention module to refine the inpainting using features from the shared encoder.

- Proposing a lightweight version called Diet-PEPSI that uses novel rate-adaptive dilated convolutions to reduce parameters while maintaining receptive field size.

- Proposing a region ensemble discriminator (RED) to handle irregular mask shapes for inpainting.

- Showing improved qualitative and quantitative performance compared to prior inpainting methods while having faster run-time and lower compute requirements.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a new inpainting network architecture that achieves better results with lower computational complexity and hardware costs compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. The key innovations are the parallel decoder, lightweight dilated convolutions, and region ensemble discriminator.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new deep learning model called PEPSI for image inpainting that uses a parallel decoding path and joint training scheme to reduce computation time while achieving improved inpainting performance compared to prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of image inpainting:

- This paper proposes a new model called PEPSI that builds on previous work using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image inpainting. It compares PEPSI to several recent methods including Context Encoder, Globally and Locally consistent image completion, Gated Convolution, and others. 

- A key contribution is reducing the hardware costs and improving speed compared to prior GAN approaches like the coarse-to-fine network. PEPSI uses a parallel decoding path and joint training scheme to train a single network instead of stacked/sequential networks. This significantly reduces computation time.

- The proposed Diet-PEPSI model further reduces parameters and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy. It does this by using novel rate-adaptive dilated convolutional layers that can capture global context with fewer parameters.

- Another contribution is the region ensemble discriminator (RED) which helps handle irregular shaped holes compared to prior discriminators that only worked on square regions. This could make the approach more practical for real applications.

- Experiments demonstrate superior quantitative performance (PSNR, SSIM) compared to prior art on CelebA-HQ and Place2 datasets. Qualitative results also show PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI generate more realistic inpainting, especially on irregular holes.

- The improvements in speed, parameters, and flexibility for irregular masks while maintaining or improving accuracy demonstrate clear advances over prior GAN inpainting techniques.

In summary, PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI advance the state-of-the-art in GAN-based image inpainting, specifically by improving efficiency and flexibility while pushing accuracy forward as well. The comparisons and experiments provide evidence these are valuable contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigating the use of rate-adaptive dilated convolution and DPUs in other vision tasks beyond image inpainting, such as image restoration, super-resolution, and style transfer. The authors suggest these techniques could be effective in other tasks that require aggregating multi-scale contextual information with low hardware costs.

- Applying the proposed region ensemble discriminator (RED) to other generative models and tasks where the target regions can appear anywhere spatially. The authors suggest RED can help improve results for irregular masks and regions.

- Further improving the contextual attention mechanism, potentially using similarity metrics other than cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. The authors suggest exploring other metrics that may better capture relationships between foreground and background feature patches.

- Evaluating the proposed methods on higher resolution images. The current experiments are on 256x256 images, so testing on larger images would be an important next step.

- Implementing the models on hardware to analyze actual speed, memory usage, power consumption, etc. The current results are computational complexity estimates.

- Combining the proposed techniques with other optimization methods like knowledge distillation to further reduce model size and improve efficiency.

- Exploring unsupervised, semi-supervised, or few-shot learning approaches to reduce dependency on large labeled datasets.

In summary, the main future directions are 1) applying the proposed methods to other vision tasks, 2) improving the contextual attention mechanism, 3) testing on higher resolution images, 4) hardware implementation, and 5) combining with other model compression and efficiency techniques. The authors provide useful suggestions for building on their approach in future research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a novel image inpainting network called PEPSI (parallel extended-decoder path for semantic inpainting) that aims to reduce computational costs while improving inpainting performance compared to prior methods. PEPSI consists of a single shared encoding network and parallel decoding paths (coarse and inpainting). The coarse path produces a preliminary result to train the encoder to predict features for the contextual attention module (CAM). Simultaneously, the inpainting path uses the CAM to reconstruct encoded features and generate higher quality results. A joint learning scheme is used to optimize both paths. An extension called Diet-PEPSI uses novel rate-adaptive dilated convolutional layers to significantly reduce parameters while maintaining performance. Experiments demonstrate PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI achieve improved quantitative scores and faster operation versus prior inpainting networks on datasets like CelebA-HQ, Place2, and ImageNet.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel image inpainting network called PEPSI that aims to reduce computational costs while improving inpainting performance compared to prior methods. PEPSI consists of a single shared encoding network and parallel decoding networks called the coarse and inpainting paths. The coarse path produces a preliminary inpainting result to train the encoding network to predict features for the contextual attention module (CAM). Simultaneously, the inpainting path generates higher quality results using the refined features reconstructed via the CAM. To train the single encoding network for these two tasks, a joint learning technique is proposed. An extended lightweight version called Diet-PEPSI is also introduced, which uses novel rate-adaptive dilated convolutional layers to reduce parameters while maintaining receptive field size. Extensive experiments demonstrate PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI achieve improved quantitative scores and significantly reduced computational time versus prior arts.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) PEPSI's parallel decoding structure improves performance and speeds versus traditional stacked coarse-to-fine architectures; (2) Diet-PEPSI further reduces parameters through rate-adaptive dilated convolutions, yet maintains accuracy; (3) Joint training enables single encoder to handle both coarse and refined inpainting. Experiments validate superiority over prior methods in accuracy, speed, and model size.

The paper proposes a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture for image inpainting called PEPSI. PEPSI consists of a single shared encoding network and parallel decoding networks including coarse and inpainting paths. The coarse path generates a preliminary inpainting result to train the encoding network to predict features for the contextual attention module (CAM). Simultaneously, the inpainting path produces a higher quality result using the refined features reconstructed via the CAM.

This allows PEPSI to generate high quality inpainting with a single network rather than requiring stacked coarse and refinement networks like prior methods. An extension called Diet-PEPSI is also introduced that uses novel rate-adaptive dilated convolutions to reduce network parameters while maintaining performance.
