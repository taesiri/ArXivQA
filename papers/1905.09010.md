# PEPSI++: Fast and Lightweight Network for Image Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a fast and lightweight inpainting network that can generate high-quality results. Specifically, the paper proposes two novel networks called PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI to overcome the limitations of prior inpainting methods like coarse-to-fine networks, in terms of speed and hardware costs while maintaining or improving inpainting performance. The key hypotheses tested in this paper are:1) A single shared encoder with parallel decoding paths (coarse and inpainting) can be trained jointly to extract useful features and generate good inpainting results, eliminating the need for stacked coarse and refinement networks. 2) Novel rate-adaptive dilated convolutional layers that share weights but produce dynamic features can effectively capture global context with fewer parameters, leading to a lightweight Diet-PEPSI model.3) A region ensemble discriminator (RED) that computes adversarial loss for each pixel can handle irregular mask shapes for real applications.The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by comparing the proposed PEPSI and Diet-PEPSI to prior inpainting methods on metrics like quality, speed, and model size. The results generally confirm the hypotheses, showing faster and lighter networks while maintaining or improving inpainting accuracy.
