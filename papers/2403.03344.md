# [Learn to Code Sustainably: An Empirical Study on LLM-based Green Code   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is an urgent need to address the environmental sustainability of software development as data centers and AI models consume significant energy and emit carbon. Practices like "green coding" aim to reduce the carbon footprint of software.  

- This paper investigates whether recently developed AI language models that can auto-generate code (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI ChatGPT, Amazon CodeWhisperer) can integrate sustainability goals and generate "greener" and more efficient code.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new metric called "Green Capacity" (GC) to quantify the "greenness" of auto-generated code based on correctness, runtime, memory usage, FLOPs and energy consumption. 

- They compare the GC of code written by humans (optimized submissions from LeetCode) to the GC of initial and optimized code generated by the AI models for 6 coding problems. 

- To optimize the auto-generated code, they prompt the models to minimize specific sustainability metrics like runtime or energy usage.

Key Findings:

- The AI models show some capability to generate more sustainable code when prompted, increasing their GC compared to their initial outputs. However, they do not reach the efficiency of human-written optimized code.

- Among the models, GitHub Copilot overall generates code with the highest GC, even outperforming humans on some problems. ChatGPT also shows good capability when optimized.

- There is variance across coding problems, indicating these tools don't fully understand sustainability impacts. The optimization prompts do provide a means to enhance efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- A new metric, GC, to assess sustainability of auto-generated code.

- An empirical comparison of the capability of leading AI coding tools to integrate green coding goals based on this metric.

- Insights into prompts that can make these models generate greener code, though further progress is required to match human performance.

The results indicate promise for AI tools to support sustainable coding but also a need for more explicit integration of sustainability objectives during their training process.
