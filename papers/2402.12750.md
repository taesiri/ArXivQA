# [Model Composition for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for creating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can process inputs from multiple modalities like image, video, audio, etc. require resource-heavy joint training with paired multimodal data. This poses challenges for scalability and extending models to new modalities. 

Proposed Solution - Model Composition:
- The paper proposes a new paradigm of model composition to create a versatile MLLM by combining existing specialized MLLMs without any training. 
- A basic implementation (NaiveMC) shows this is possible by reusing encoders and merging LM parameters.
- An advanced model DAMC uses parameter decoupling and adjustment to mitigate issues like parameter interference during merging.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes model composition for MLLMs to inherit modal understanding capabilities from existing models through a training-free and extensible process.
- Introduces NaiveMC and DAMC frameworks for model composition. DAMC leverages parameter decoupling and adaptive adjustment for optimal performance.
- Constructs a new benchmark MCUB for evaluating ability to identify commonalities across diverse modal inputs.
- Experiments on various multimodal understanding tasks demonstrate DAMC allows creating high-performing versatile MLLMs adept at handling any combination of modalities like image, video, audio and point cloud.

In summary, the paper explores a practical model composition approach to integrate specialized MLLMs into a unified model possessing enhanced multimodal understanding capacities, enabled through parameter manipulation techniques.
