# [Model Composition for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for creating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can process inputs from multiple modalities like image, video, audio, etc. require resource-heavy joint training with paired multimodal data. This poses challenges for scalability and extending models to new modalities. 

Proposed Solution - Model Composition:
- The paper proposes a new paradigm of model composition to create a versatile MLLM by combining existing specialized MLLMs without any training. 
- A basic implementation (NaiveMC) shows this is possible by reusing encoders and merging LM parameters.
- An advanced model DAMC uses parameter decoupling and adjustment to mitigate issues like parameter interference during merging.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes model composition for MLLMs to inherit modal understanding capabilities from existing models through a training-free and extensible process.
- Introduces NaiveMC and DAMC frameworks for model composition. DAMC leverages parameter decoupling and adaptive adjustment for optimal performance.
- Constructs a new benchmark MCUB for evaluating ability to identify commonalities across diverse modal inputs.
- Experiments on various multimodal understanding tasks demonstrate DAMC allows creating high-performing versatile MLLMs adept at handling any combination of modalities like image, video, audio and point cloud.

In summary, the paper explores a practical model composition approach to integrate specialized MLLMs into a unified model possessing enhanced multimodal understanding capacities, enabled through parameter manipulation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework for composing multiple multimodal large language models through parameter decoupling and adjustment to create a versatile model capable of processing diverse modalities without additional training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It proposes the concept of model composition for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), realized through the NaiveMC framework. This allows for seamless integration of different MLLMs without additional training, enabling zero-shot multi-modality expansion. 

2. It introduces DAMC, an advanced model composition framework that employs parameter decoupling and adaptive adjustment to mitigate parameter interference and optimize composite model performance across multiple modalities.

3. It creates MCUB, a benchmark designed to evaluate the unified understanding of diverse modalities, and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model composition frameworks via extensive experiments on various multimodal understanding tasks and MCUB.

In summary, the key innovation is using model composition to create a versatile multimodal model from existing specialized MLLMs, without needing extra multimodal training data. The proposed techniques of parameter decoupling and adjustment are shown to enhance the performance of the composite model.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
- Model composition
- Parameter decoupling
- Parameter adjustment 
- Zero-shot multi-modality expansion
- Image, audio, video, point cloud modalities

The paper proposes techniques for model composition to integrate different existing MLLMs without additional training to create a versatile model that can process inputs from various modalities. The key ideas include parameter decoupling to separate modality-specific and language model parameters, and adaptive parameter adjustment to optimize performance. The methods aim to enable zero-shot expansion to new modalities for MLLMs through this training-free composition process. Experiments on audio-visual QA, 3D classification and the proposed MCUB benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness.

In summary, the key focus is on model composition for multimodal LLMs to achieve multi-modality capabilities, using strategies like parameter decoupling and adjustment to mitigate issues like parameter interference.
