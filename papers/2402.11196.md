# [Maintaining Adversarial Robustness in Continuous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Adversarial attacks can fool neural networks by adding small perturbations to inputs. Defenses have been developed to make models more robust, but the robustness gained is lost when the model is updated to learn new tasks (via continuous/lifelong learning).

- Existing defense methods and continual learning methods alone are not enough to maintain robustness during continuous learning. 

Solution:
- The paper proposes a new capability called "continual robust learning" which maintains both performance and adversarial robustness on previous tasks when learning new ones. 

- A novel algorithm called "Double Gradient Projection (DGP)" is introduced that projects gradients orthogonal to two crucial subspaces during learning:
   - Subspace 1 stabilizes final outputs to maintain performance on prior tasks
   - Subspace 2 stabilizes gradients w.r.t. inputs to maintain robustness on prior tasks

Contributions:
- Identifies the problem of adversarial robustness decaying during continuous learning, which has not been previously studied.

- Proposes the new concept of "continual robust learning" to maintain both accuracy and robustness across tasks.

- Develops the DGP algorithm that projects gradients to stabilize outputs and input gradients for prior tasks. Experiments show DGP maintains robustness under strong attacks while also retaining good performance.

- Analysis shows explicitly how stabilizing smoothed input gradients leads to preservation of adversarial robustness during continuous learning.

- Results significantly outperform baselines from naively combining existing adversarial defense and continual learning methods.
