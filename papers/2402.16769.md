# [Unifying Latent and Lexicon Representations for Effective Video-Text   Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video-text retrieval methods using dual encoders compress videos/texts into global latent representations. This makes it difficult to capture fine-grained semantics.
- Methods adding interaction modules sacrifice retrieval speed. Features from interaction modules cannot be pre-cached.
- It's challenging to explicitly learn fine-grained representations that can reflect semantics.

Proposed Solution - UNIFY Framework
- Learns lexicon representations to capture fine-grained semantics. Each dimension corresponds to a word/semantic concept.
- Grounds videos/texts into relevant dimensions and suppresses irrelevant ones via a 2-stage semantics grounding approach.
- Unifies the complementary global latent and fine-grained lexicon representations via structure sharing and self-distillation for mutual learning.

Key Contributions:
- Presents lexicon representations for videos/texts to capture fine-grained semantics.
- Proposes a 2-stage approach to ground videos/texts into relevant semantic dimensions.
- Unifies latent and lexicon representations via structure sharing and self-distillation for mutual learning.
- Experiments show the model outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods by 4.8% and 8.2% on MSR-VTT and DiDeMo datasets.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of learning fine-grained semantics for video-text retrieval. It proposes lexicon representations and unifies them with latent representations via an effective framework. Experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance.
