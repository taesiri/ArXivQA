# [A Constructive, Type-Theoretic Approach to Regression via Global   Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12868)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can the concepts of searchability, constructive real numbers, and type theory be used to formalize and generalize the concepts of global optimization and regression analysis?In particular, the paper aims to use the idea of "searchable types" to formulate novel convergence criteria for regression that are derived from convergence properties of global optimization. The key ideas are:- Framing regression as a form of global optimization, where model parameters are computed to minimize a loss function compared to a target "oracle" function.- Using the concept of searchability to define spaces ("S-types") where elements can be systematically searched for. This allows formulating computable regression algorithms.- Defining explicit continuity conditions on S-types to make the theory compatible with constructive type theory and formal proofs in Agda. - Generalizing convergence of global optimization from real spaces to S-types. This allows formulating convergence criteria for regression in a more abstract setting.- Distinguishing between "perfect" and "imperfect" models. Theorems are provided on absolute convergence for both cases.- Illustrating how the framework accommodates standard regression examples like polynomial regression, as well as more advanced models like infinite power series.So in summary, the core hypothesis is that using searchable types, constructive real numbers and type theory provides a useful foundation to formalize, generalize and reason about convergence in global optimization and regression analysis. The Agda formalization demonstrates the viability of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a new constructive, type-theoretic approach to regression analysis through the concepts of searchability and continuous $\mathfrak{S}$-types. Specifically, the paper:- Establishes connections between deterministic global optimisation, general regression, searchable types, and constructive real numbers.- Provides a formalisation of key concepts like searchability, continuity, and convergence in the dependently typed language Agda.- Generalises the notion of searchability and continuity to higher-order functions to allow formulating novel convergence criteria for regression.- Defines a type of continuously searchable types called $\mathfrak{S}$-types which can represent compact real intervals and sequences. - Proves that all $\mathfrak{S}$-types are continuously searchable using Tychonoff-style theorems.- Formulates regression as a search problem over $\mathfrak{S}$-types and proves convergence theorems for "perfect" and "imperfect" model cases.- Shows the approach can handle examples like polynomial regression, solving equations, and universal function approximation.So in summary, the main contribution is developing a new type-theoretic foundation for regression with formal proofs and demonstrating its applicability through examples. The formalisation and generality of the approach are highlights.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper examines connections between global optimization and regression through the lens of constructive type theory, introducing searchability to generalize continuity and convergence criteria using the proof assistant Agda.
