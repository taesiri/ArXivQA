# [A Constructive, Type-Theoretic Approach to Regression via Global   Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12868)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can the concepts of searchability, constructive real numbers, and type theory be used to formalize and generalize the concepts of global optimization and regression analysis?

In particular, the paper aims to use the idea of "searchable types" to formulate novel convergence criteria for regression that are derived from convergence properties of global optimization. The key ideas are:

- Framing regression as a form of global optimization, where model parameters are computed to minimize a loss function compared to a target "oracle" function.

- Using the concept of searchability to define spaces ("S-types") where elements can be systematically searched for. This allows formulating computable regression algorithms.

- Defining explicit continuity conditions on S-types to make the theory compatible with constructive type theory and formal proofs in Agda. 

- Generalizing convergence of global optimization from real spaces to S-types. This allows formulating convergence criteria for regression in a more abstract setting.

- Distinguishing between "perfect" and "imperfect" models. Theorems are provided on absolute convergence for both cases.

- Illustrating how the framework accommodates standard regression examples like polynomial regression, as well as more advanced models like infinite power series.

So in summary, the core hypothesis is that using searchable types, constructive real numbers and type theory provides a useful foundation to formalize, generalize and reason about convergence in global optimization and regression analysis. The Agda formalization demonstrates the viability of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a new constructive, type-theoretic approach to regression analysis through the concepts of searchability and continuous $\mathfrak{S}$-types. 

Specifically, the paper:

- Establishes connections between deterministic global optimisation, general regression, searchable types, and constructive real numbers.

- Provides a formalisation of key concepts like searchability, continuity, and convergence in the dependently typed language Agda.

- Generalises the notion of searchability and continuity to higher-order functions to allow formulating novel convergence criteria for regression.

- Defines a type of continuously searchable types called $\mathfrak{S}$-types which can represent compact real intervals and sequences. 

- Proves that all $\mathfrak{S}$-types are continuously searchable using Tychonoff-style theorems.

- Formulates regression as a search problem over $\mathfrak{S}$-types and proves convergence theorems for "perfect" and "imperfect" model cases.

- Shows the approach can handle examples like polynomial regression, solving equations, and universal function approximation.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing a new type-theoretic foundation for regression with formal proofs and demonstrating its applicability through examples. The formalisation and generality of the approach are highlights.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper examines connections between global optimization and regression through the lens of constructive type theory, introducing searchability to generalize continuity and convergence criteria using the proof assistant Agda.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of constructive type theory and regression:

- The key novelty of this paper is using the concept of "searchable types" to connect deterministic global optimization and regression. This provides a new perspective compared to most existing work on regression, which looks at statistical/probabilistic approaches. The searchable types concept allows the authors to prove strong convergence guarantees for regression in a constructive type theory setting.

- The focus on formalization in Agda also distinguishes this paper. Fully formalized proofs are still relatively rare in this field, so providing machine-checked proofs of all the key results adds significantly to the rigor. This level of formalization is a unique strength.

- Most related work on constructive mathematics and regression relies on synthetic topology, where all functions are assumed continuous. This paper takes a different approach by explicitly requiring continuity conditions, which allows the proofs to be formalized in Agda. This is a noteworthy difference in technique.

- Compared to statistical/PAC approaches to regression and learning, this work offers complementary convergence criteria based on constructive mathematics. It provides quantitative deterministic guarantees rather than probabilistic bounds. So it occupies a distinct niche in the literature.

- Within the constructive type theory literature, this paper builds closely on Escardo's work on searchable types and compact sets. However, it connects those concepts to regression and optimization in original ways. The application to regression is a novel contribution.

In summary, I would say the key distinguishing features of this paper are the use of searchable types for regression, the fully formalized Agda proofs, and the deterministic convergence guarantees. The connections drawn between several disparate areas—optimization, constructive real numbers, searchable types, and regression—are creative and not found elsewhere in the literature. Overall it occupies a unique niche that nicely complements both the statistics-focused and constructive mathematics-focused literatures on regression.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:

- Further exploring off-line learning, in particular using interpolation to relate it to on-line learning. The authors suggest proving a version of the Stone-Weierstrass interpolation theorem to show that interpolating from a large enough sample allows reconstructing the original function arbitrarily well. This could allow relating their framework to probabilistic sampling and PAC learning more closely.

- Finding better interpolation algorithms, potentially allowing convergence results for non-parametric regression. The authors suggest this could also resolve some foundational issues with their current simple interpolation algorithm.

- Implementing more efficient regressors, likely by extracting them from Agda or implementing directly in a performance-oriented language. This requires fast arbitrary precision real number arithmetic.

- Finding topological/type-theoretic characterizations of PAC concepts like VC dimension to further connect the frameworks. 

- Expanding the techniques to more sophisticated function representations beyond polynomials, such as power series or neural networks. This could require approximating infinite sums or dealing with non-continuous aspects like network architecture.

- Broadening the class of functions that can be represented, while retaining continuity and computability properties. The authors suggest compactifications of the reals as one potential way forward.

- Further exploration of the tension between mathematical functions and their type-theoretic representations, in particular for concepts like loss functions. Resolving this could lead to more mathematically natural definitions.

In summary, the main directions are expanding the theory to more practical ML settings, relating it more tightly to probabilistic/PAC learning, implementation for efficiency, and resolving some foundational issues. The authors lay out an extensive research program building on their initial results.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a constructive, type-theoretic approach to regression via global optimisation. The key ideas are:

- Regression is formalised as finding parameters for a model to minimise loss against an oracle. This is connected to general, deterministic global optimisation. 

- The framework of "searchable types" based on constructive mathematics is used. Key theorems show all such types have continuous searchers, enabling computation of optima.

- Regression convergence theorems are proved, showing models can approximate oracles arbitrarily well. Both "perfect" models, identical to the oracle for some parameter, and "imperfect" models are considered. 

- All theory and examples are formalised in the Agda proof assistant. Constructive proofs require explicit continuity conditions, ensuring compatibility with type theory.

- Examples like polynomial regression and infinite series models demonstrate the framework's applicability. Convergence guarantees depend on model continuity. The approach is complementary to probabilistic PAC learning.

In summary, the paper gives a novel, formalised framework connecting regression and global optimisation via constructive mathematics and type theory. Convergence theorems capture what it means for regression algorithms to be correct.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper examines connections between global optimization, regression analysis, and constructive type theory. It introduces the concept of "searchable types" which are types that support the construction of algorithms to find elements satisfying certain predicates. Using this concept, the authors define "S-types" which are searchable types formed from finite types, products of S-types, and sequences of S-types. They prove all S-types are "continuously searchable", meaning any continuous detachable predicate has a continuous "searcher" function that finds a witness. 

The main results show how the convergence of global optimization follows from searchability. The authors formulate general criteria for regression convergence using higher-order searchable types. This allows generalizing continuity and searchability to higher-order functions. Key theorems characterize when regression algorithms converge absolutely, both for perfect models (where the model equals the target function) and imperfect models. The framework supports common regression examples like polynomial regression. All theory and examples are formalized in the Agda proof assistant. Overall, the paper connects global optimization, regression analysis, and type theory via the unifying concept of searchability.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a constructive, type-theoretic approach to regression via global optimisation. The key method is to formulate regression problems in terms of 'searchable types' (S-types). S-types include finite types, products of S-types, and functions from the natural numbers to an S-type. The authors prove that all S-types are 'continuously searchable', meaning any continuous and detachable predicate on an S-type has a continuous 'searcher' function that finds a witness satisfying the predicate. Using this framework, they formulate general convergence criteria for regression in terms of finding witnesses satisfying continuity and loss constraints. The searchability of S-types guarantees the existence of regressor functions satisfying these convergence criteria.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of establishing connections between deterministic, complete, and general global optimization of continuous functions and regression from a constructive type-theoretic perspective. The key idea explored is using the concept of "searchability" to develop convergence criteria for regression derived from the convergence properties of global optimization algorithms.

Some key points:

- The paper aims to establish new connections between global optimization, regression, searchable types, and constructive real numbers. 

- It takes a type-theoretic approach by requiring explicit continuity conditions, allowing proofs to be formalized in the Agda proof assistant.

- It provides convergence theorems for regression, distinguishing between "perfect" models (same as the oracle) and "imperfect" models. The theorems characterize when regression algorithms are guaranteed to converge.

- The framework can handle standard regression problems like polynomial regression, as well as more advanced models like infinite Taylor series.

- The main convergence theorem states that for a large class of continuous oracles, regression can find parameters that make the model converge to the oracle up to any desired precision, even with distortions, as long as the distortions are small.

So in summary, the key problem addressed is establishing constructive, type-theoretic convergence guarantees for regression algorithms derived from global optimization theory and using the concept of searchability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Global optimisation - The paper focuses on algorithms for general, complete, continuous, deterministic global optimisation. This involves finding guaranteed global minima of continuous functions.

- Regression - A main goal is establishing connections between global optimisation and regression. Regression involves finding parameters for a model to minimise a loss/error function compared to data. 

- Searchability - The concept of searchability, based on earlier work by Escardó, is crucial. Searchability involves constructing algorithms to find elements satisfying a predicate in certain spaces like compact types.

- Continuous functions - A key focus is working with representations of continuous real functions that can be defined constructively. Continuity notions are formalised for the searchable type framework.

- Convergence - The paper aims to establish convergence criteria for regression algorithms, including for imperfect models. This involves bounding the loss between a regressed model and true model based on the distortion between true and distorted models.

- Type theory - The framework uses constructive type theory, with all main results formalised in the Agda proof assistant. Key concepts include searchable types and continuity.

- Machine learning - While not a core focus, the work provides a constructive perspective related to concepts like model fitting and sampling that are relevant for machine learning.

So in summary, the key terms cover global optimisation, regression, searchability, continuity, convergence, type theory, and connections to machine learning. The formalisation in type theory is a distinguishing aspect.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines the connections between global optimization and regression from the perspective of constructive type theory. It introduces the concept of 'searchability' to connect optimization and regression through the lens of compact spaces. The authors use the Agda proof assistant to fully formalize the theory and proofs. 

The paper shows how convergence properties of global optimization follow from searchability. It generalizes searchability and continuity to higher-order functions to formulate new convergence criteria for regression based on optimization convergence.

The authors prove regression can be formulated as global minimization with an optimal-within-epsilon solution. However, this does not guarantee absolute convergence. So they prove stronger theorems characterizing when regression algorithms converge absolutely, distinguishing between perfect models (that match the oracle) and imperfect ones. 

For imperfect models, the error between the regressed model and oracle is bounded by the error between the oracle and the imperfect guess. As an application, they show polynomial regression converges. The framework uses constructive reals and explicit continuity conditions compatible with Agda to formalize everything constructively.
