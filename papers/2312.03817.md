# [Diffusion Illusions: Hiding Images in Plain Sight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Diffusion Illusions: Hiding Images in Plain Sight":

Problem: 
The paper explores the problem of automatically generating "illusion" images - sets of images that when arranged and viewed in certain ways reveal hidden objects or scenes. For example, an image that looks like a duck when upright, but looks like a rabbit when rotated 180 degrees. Or a set of images that when stacked on top of each other reveal a QR code. Generating such illusions has been difficult and requires immense manual effort and skill. 

Solution - Diffusion Illusions Framework:
The paper proposes a framework called "Diffusion Illusions" to automatically generate various kinds of illusion images using text-to-image diffusion models. The key ideas are:

1) Formalize the illusion generation process using the concepts of "prime" images and "derived" images. Prime images are the actual images generated. Derived images are the interpretations perceived when prime images are arranged/composed in specific ways.

2) Utilize Fourier Feature Networks to represent prime images for optimization.

3) Optimize the prime images using two losses provided by the diffusion model - Score Distillation Loss and a new Dream Target Loss. These losses pull the derived images towards user-provided target text prompts or images.

4) Study and showcase three types of illusions - Flip, Rotation Overlay, and Hidden Overlay.

Contributions:
1) First framework to formally define and formulate the illusion image generation problem. 

2) Diffusion Illusions - first comprehensive pipeline to automatically generate diverse, high-quality illusions with control using text prompts.

3) Demonstrates effectiveness through quantitative evaluation as well as by physically fabricating the generated illusions.

Overall, the paper makes illusion generation accessible to even non-experts by taking advantage of recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models.
