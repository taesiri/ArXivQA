# [Calibrating Long-form Generations from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) rely on a binary notion of response correctness, inadequate for long-form text generation where answers can be partially correct.  
- Existing confidence elicitation techniques also provide scores reflecting if an answer is fully correct, not applicable to tasks like open-ended QA and summarization where correctness lies on a continuum.
- There is a need for more nuanced calibration frameworks that capture the granularity of long-form generation.

Proposed Solution:
- A calibration system that treats both correctness and confidence as distributions across scores from 0 to 1, allowing more precise alignment.
- Methods to estimate ground-truth correctness distributions using an LLM evaluator.
- Eliciting confidence through self-evaluation and self-consistency.  
- New calibration metrics like Wasserstein Similarity and Selective F1 tailored to long-form text.

Key Contributions:
- A general calibration framework for all text generation tasks, enhancing LLM evaluation.  
- Innovative techniques for confidence elicitation and calibration measurement.
- Analysis showing calibration is dependent on metrics, models and tasks. Larger models don't necessarily have better calibration.
- Evidence that calibration can be improved via fine-tuning, document incorporation, temperature scaling and combined elicitation.
- Demonstration of a practical application optimizing model usage based on calibration.

In summary, this research pioneers more reliable and nuanced methodologies for evaluating LLMs across long-form generation tasks, serving as an invaluable contribution towards developing trustworthy language models.
