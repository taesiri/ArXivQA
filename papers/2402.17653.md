# [Mitigating Distributional Shift in Semantic Segmentation via Uncertainty   Estimation from Unlabelled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17653)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Semantic segmentation is crucial for robotic visual understanding. However, segmentation networks still struggle when tested on data distributionally shifted from their training distribution (e.g. different environments and weather conditions). This is problematic for robotics applications like autonomous vehicles, as standards require the ability to detect out-of-distribution situations. A major limitation is the cost of labelling data, making it hard to cover all possible test scenarios with labelled training data.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a segmentation network that can detect its own errors caused by challenging test distributions. It does this in a single forward pass without needing additional annotations. Easy-to-obtain unlabelled and uncurated data from the target domain is used to selectively enforce consistency over input augmentations. This consistency is used as a proxy to train the network to estimate uncertainty for inconsistent regions. 

The network incorporates class prototypes, global feature aggregation vectors calculated from the source dataset. At inference, segmentation is performed by thresholding distances between pixel embeddings and prototypes. The threshold also separates features into certain/uncertain, becoming an uncertainty estimate. 

Additional losses enforce feature uniformity and spread prototypes, preventing collapse. Asymmetry between the branches handling augmented images prevents trivial consistency solutions. A curriculum presenting target domains by increasing distribution shift is also proposed.

Contributions:
1) A training method to learn pixel-wise uncertainty estimation alongside segmentation by leveraging unlabelled data
2) Evaluation of robustness against uncertainty methods on a novel segmentation benchmark with labels over 3 autonomous driving domains and 700 test labels
3) The proposed network outperforms methods by 10.7% in AUROC and 19.2% in AUPR, without increasing computational cost over a standard segmentation network. Qualitative examples demonstrate erroneous segments being appropriately flagged uncertain.
