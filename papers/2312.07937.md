# [BOTH2Hands: Inferring 3D Hands from Both Text Prompts and Body Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07937)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called BOTH2Hands for generating realistic two-hand motions from both text prompts describing desired hand gestures and implicit body dynamics. To enable research in this novel hybrid text-body to hands generation task, the authors contribute a large-scale multi-modal dataset called BOTH57M. This dataset contains accurate motion tracking data of 57.4 million frames capturing intricate hand and body motions of 8 hours of activities, along with rich textual annotations describing motions at both the body and detailed finger level. BOTH2Hands first warms up two separate diffusion models conditioning on body dynamics and text prompts respectively. It then blends the outputs using a cross-attention transformer to generate hand motions aligning with the multi-modal inputs. Experiments demonstrate BOTH2Hands generates more convincing hand motions than state-of-the-art methods. Tests also validate the richness of BOTH57M for two-hand generation compared to existing datasets. The released dataset, code and models will support further research directions in multi-modal controllable hand motion generation and analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents BOTH2Hands, a novel approach and large-scale dataset for generating vivid two-hand motions from both implicit body dynamics and explicit text prompts through parallel diffusion models and a cross-attention transformer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1. Proposing a novel scheme to generate fine-grained two-hand motions under a hybrid setting: from both implicit body dynamics and explicit text prompts. 

2. Contributing a large-scale multi-modal dataset (BOTH57M) for two-hand generation, with accurate body and hand motions as well as rich finger-level textual annotations.

3. Combining parallel diffusion structures with a subsequent cross-attention transformer to effectively generate hand motions from various conditions like body dynamics and text prompts. 

4. Tackling the data scarcity issue by releasing the BOTH57M dataset, codes, and pre-trained models for future exploration.

In summary, the key contribution is generating vivid two-hand motions by conditioning on both body dynamics and text prompts, enabled by the novel BOTH57M dataset and BOTH2Hands algorithm combining diffusion models and cross-attention transformers. The released resources aim to facilitate future research in this direction.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage mechanism with parallel diffusion models and a subsequent cross-attention transformer for blending motions. What is the rationale behind using two separate diffusion models instead of a single model with multiple conditions? How does this design choice affect the learning and blending of motions?

2. The paper uses both relative and absolute representations for rotations and positions when processing text-conditioned hands. Why is this mixed representation used instead of a consistent one? How does the choice of reference frame affect the gesture generation and blending process? 

3. The paper employs forward kinematics to project the text-conditioned hand motions from local space to global space. What would be the potential issues if this projection was not performed? How significant is the impact on the final blended motions?

4. The cross-attention transformer alternates the text-conditioned and body-conditioned motions when computing attention. Why is this alternating attention approach used? How does it ensure balancing and blending of the different conditioning signals? 

5. How suitable would the proposed approach be for online motion generation where new text prompts are provided continuously? Would the two-stage design incur high latency? How can the method be adapted for such interactive scenarios?

6. The paper uses a reconstruction loss for training the diffusion models. What other objective functions could be explored? How would that affect the quality and diversity of the conditioned motions?

7. The conditioning strengths for text vs body are controlled via scalar weights currently. Can more advanced schemes like learnable gates or attention modulation be incorporated? What benefits would that provide?

8. Can other sequence models like RNNs, Transformers or Latent Diffusion Models replace the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models used currently? What are the tradeoffs involved?  

9. The current blending method gives equal weightage to all timesteps while combining motions. Can temporally varying blending be incorporated? How will that impact synchronization of gestures with conditions?

10. The paper focuses on skeletal motions currently. How can the approach be extended to generate full rendered motions with surface details? What additional components would need to be developed?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating realistic human motions requires accompanying hand motions, but existing text-to-motion methods focus on body motions only without considering rich two-hand motions. 
- Body-to-hand methods can synthesize hand motions from body dynamics, but lack explicit control.  
- Data scarcity poses challenges for two-hand motion generation and modeling the connections between body dynamics and textual prompts.

Proposed Solution:
- Present BOTH57M, a large-scale multi-modal dataset with accurate body and hand motions, rich finger-level annotations and descriptive body texts under diverse activities.

- Propose BOTH2Hands, a novel framework to generate two-hand motions from both implicit body dynamics and explicit text prompts:
    - Use two parallel diffusion models conditioned on body and text to generate motions separately. 
    - Adopt a cross-attention transformer to blend the body-conditioned and text-conditioned hand motions.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset providing hybrid and detailed annotations of both body and hands for future multi-modal control and behavior analysis.

- First framework to generate two-hand motions from both body dynamics and text prompts by combining parallel diffusion structures and cross-attention blending.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating effectiveness of the approach and data for two-hand generation. The data and model also showcase generalization capabilities on other datasets.

- The novel dataset, framework and thorough evaluations open up future research on controllable and vivid two-hand motion generation.
