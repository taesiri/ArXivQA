# [Domain Adaptation of Multilingual Semantic Search -- Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dense retrievers require a lot of labeled data to train, which is scarce for most specialized domains and languages besides English. 
- Methods exist to adapt dense retrievers to new domains (domain adaptation) and to new languages (multilingual models), but little research explores combining both to enable multilingual semantic search in specialized domains.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper reviews methods for domain adaptation of dense retrievers, categorizing them based on which part of the retrieval pipeline they modify: data (query generation, contrastive learning, distillation), models (size, capability), training (multi-task, domain-invariant, parameter-efficient), and ranking (integrating lexical matching).
- It also summarizes recent advances in multilingual semantic search using cross-lingual models and knowledge distillation.
- It discusses combining domain adaptation methods with multilingual models as a promising direction for multilingual semantic search in specialized domains.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a taxonomy of domain adaptation methods for dense retrievers based on which part of the pipeline they modify.
- Reviews recent advances in multilingual semantic search.
- Discusses open questions around combining domain adaptation and multilingual methods to enable multilingual semantic search in specialized domains.
- Suggests specific techniques like using cross-lingual models for query generation or distillation with multilingual teachers as interesting future work.

In summary, the key gap identified is methods to adapt dense retrievers to specialized domains in multiple languages. The paper systematically categorizes prior work and suggests combining ideas from domain adaptation and multilingual methods as a promising direction for future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper reviews current approaches for domain adaptation of dense textual information retrieval systems to low-resource settings, introduces a typology to cluster them, and discusses combining domain adaptation with multilingual semantic search.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on approaches for performing domain adaptation in multilingual semantic search, specifically focusing on low-resource settings. The key contributions are:

1) It develops a new typology to categorize existing domain adaptation approaches for dense textual information retrieval systems based on which component of the system they adapt (data, model, training, ranking). This provides a structured way to analyze compatibility of different methods.

2) It summarizes recent advances in both domain adaptation for semantic search as well as multilingual semantic search. This gives background on the state-of-the-art in both areas. 

3) It discusses the potential for combining domain adaptation techniques with multilingual semantic search models, which has been rarely explored so far. Specific open questions around using cross-lingual models for query generation or applying knowledge distillation with multilingual student models are raised.

4) Overall, this review explores the promising research direction of adapting multilingual dense retrievers to specialized domains in low-resource settings - an area that can help break down language barriers and increase access to domain-specific information. The analysis and discussion lay groundwork and open problems for future research on this topic.

In summary, the main contribution is a structured analysis of connections between domain adaptation and multilingual semantic search focused on low-resource scenarios, elucidating this as an important open research area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multilingual semantic search - Performing semantic search across multiple languages
- Cross-lingual dense retriever - A model that can retrieve relevant passages from a corpus in multiple languages
- Domain adaptation - Adapting models to new domains or datasets with limited labeled data
- Low resource - Settings with scarce labeled data
- Zero-shot - Applying a model to new tasks/domains without additional fine-tuning 
- Dense retrieval - Semantic matching between queries and documents using dense vector representations 
- Query generation - Automatically generating queries from documents to create training data
- Contrastive learning - Creating pseudo training data by treating different augmentations/parts of text as positive examples
- Knowledge distillation - Transferring knowledge from a teacher to student model
- Parameter-efficient learning - Modifying only a subset of model parameters to retain general knowledge

The key focus areas seem to be methods for adapting dense retrievers to new low-resource domains and languages, with a goal of performing effective multilingual semantic search. The paper reviews different techniques like data augmentation, model modifications, and training strategies to enable this.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper categorizes domain adaptation approaches based on which component of the information retrieval pipeline they adapt. What are the different components identified and what methods target each one?

2. The paper discusses using query generation to create pseudo labeled data. What are the different categories of query generators and how do they work? What mechanisms can be used to filter low-quality generated queries?

3. Contrastive learning is discussed as another method to construct pseudo labeled data. What are the different strategies outlined for forming positive query-document pairs, such as perturbation-based methods, summary-based methods, etc.?

4. Knowledge distillation is used to establish missing links between independent queries and documents from the target domain. What are the different choices of teacher models? How can the outputs of the teacher model be passed to the student as hard or soft labels?

5. What are the different multi-task learning approaches suggested to improve model generalization? How does multi-task learning help mitigate overfitting?

6. Explain the core training objective and loss function components used in domain-invariant learning. What are the two popular choices for the discrepancy function D to quantify the distance between domain distributions?

7. The paper discusses adapting model training through parameter-efficient learning. What are the different pre-training strategies this can enhance? What are some techniques to implement parameter-efficient learning?

8. How does integrating sparse retrieval into the ranking adaptation level combine the strengths of both dense and sparse methods? What are some ways this can be implemented?  

9. Summarize some of the key ideas and methods highlighted in the paper for performing multilingual semantic search, like using cross-lingual models.
