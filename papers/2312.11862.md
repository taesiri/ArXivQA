# [Topo-MLP : A Simplicial Network Without Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11862)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing methods for learning on higher-order network structures like simplicial complexes rely on explicit message passing schemes. While powerful, explicit message passing has disadvantages - it requires knowledge of the connectivity structure during inference, and is less robust to missing or corrupted connectivity information.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Topo-MLP, a novel MLP-based simplicial neural network that learns representations of simplices (nodes, edges, faces) in a simplicial complex without relying on explicit message passing. 

- Topo-MLP uses a novel Higher Order Neighborhood Contrastive (HONC) loss to implicitly encode the simplicial structure into the learned representations. This loss ensures that representations of incident simplices are embedded close together.

- Training can be done in an end-to-end, batch fashion without requiring the full simplicial structure, enabling efficiency.

- During inference, Topo-MLP does not require any connectivity information, making it robust and faster compared to message passing models.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of Topo-MLP - first MLP-based simplicial network without explicit message passing

- Introduction of the Higher Order Neighborhood Contrastive (HONC) loss to implicitly incorporate simplicial structure

- Demonstrating through experiments that Topo-MLP achieves competitive performance on node classification, is more robust to missing/corrupted structure, and has faster inference than message passing baselines.

In summary, the key innovation is a simplicial network that can effectively learn from higher-order connectivity structures without relying on explicit message passing schemes. This provides simplicity, efficiency, and robustness benefits.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Topo-MLP, a novel MLP-based simplicial neural network for learning representations of elements in a simplicial complex without relying on explicit message passing. Specifically:

1) It proposes Topo-MLP, an MLP-based model that learns simplicial representations by utilizing a Higher Order Neighborhood Contrastive (HONC) loss to implicitly incorporate the simplicial structure, without using message passing during training or inference. 

2) It demonstrates through experiments that Topo-MLP achieves competitive performance on node classification compared to state-of-the-art graph neural networks, while also being more robust to missing or corrupted connectivity information and having faster inference times since it does not depend on message passing.

3) More broadly, it provides a new direction for learning on higher-order structures like simplicial complexes without directly relying on message passing paradigms commonly used in graph neural networks and other simplicial networks. The simplicity of Topo-MLP makes it an attractive model for domains where connectivity information may be uncertain or unreliable.

In summary, the key innovation is a simplicial network that can learn representations of elements in a complex while implicitly encoding structural information, without explicitly using message passing. This makes the model faster, more robust, and widely applicable.
