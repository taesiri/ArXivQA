# [Topo-MLP : A Simplicial Network Without Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11862)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing methods for learning on higher-order network structures like simplicial complexes rely on explicit message passing schemes. While powerful, explicit message passing has disadvantages - it requires knowledge of the connectivity structure during inference, and is less robust to missing or corrupted connectivity information.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Topo-MLP, a novel MLP-based simplicial neural network that learns representations of simplices (nodes, edges, faces) in a simplicial complex without relying on explicit message passing. 

- Topo-MLP uses a novel Higher Order Neighborhood Contrastive (HONC) loss to implicitly encode the simplicial structure into the learned representations. This loss ensures that representations of incident simplices are embedded close together.

- Training can be done in an end-to-end, batch fashion without requiring the full simplicial structure, enabling efficiency.

- During inference, Topo-MLP does not require any connectivity information, making it robust and faster compared to message passing models.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of Topo-MLP - first MLP-based simplicial network without explicit message passing

- Introduction of the Higher Order Neighborhood Contrastive (HONC) loss to implicitly incorporate simplicial structure

- Demonstrating through experiments that Topo-MLP achieves competitive performance on node classification, is more robust to missing/corrupted structure, and has faster inference than message passing baselines.

In summary, the key innovation is a simplicial network that can effectively learn from higher-order connectivity structures without relying on explicit message passing schemes. This provides simplicity, efficiency, and robustness benefits.
