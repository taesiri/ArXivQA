# [Comparing Human and Machine Bias in Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08396)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:1) How and to what extent do humans exhibit bias in their accuracy on facial recognition tasks like identification and verification? (RQ1) 2) How does the bias exhibited by humans compare to the bias exhibited by machine learning models on the same facial recognition tasks? (RQ2)The key hypotheses appear to be:- Both humans and machine learning models will exhibit biases related to gender and skin tone in their facial recognition accuracy. - The magnitude of these biases will be comparable between humans and machines.- Humans will perform better on facial recognition tasks involving subjects that match their own demographics.So in summary, the central questions have to do with measuring and comparing biases in facial recognition between humans and machine learning models. The hypotheses predict that both groups will show biases, but they will be similar in magnitude, and humans will be better at recognizing faces like their own. The experiments and analysis are designed to test these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The creation of a new facial recognition dataset called InterRace through extensive hand curation and labeling to fix issues with existing datasets like LFW and CelebA. This new dataset has more balanced demographic groups and accurate identity labels. 2. Development of a survey with challenging facial verification and identification questions that was given to both humans (545 crowdworkers) and machine learning models.3. Comparative analysis of the results to identify biases and performance disparities between humans and machines on these facial recognition tasks. 4. Key findings that both humans and academic ML models exhibit biases favoring male and lighter-skinned subjects, with the biases being of comparable magnitude between the two. Commercial APIs were found to be extremely accurate overall.5. The dataset and survey instrument developed could be useful for future evaluations of facial recognition systems.In summary, the main contribution seems to be the careful curation of a new dataset to enable properly measuring bias in facial recognition, paired with a novel human-machine comparative analysis that reveals comparable levels of bias. The results also highlight the higher accuracy of commercial systems versus academic models and untrained humans.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately, without seeing the full text of the paper, it is difficult for me to provide a meaningful one sentence summary. A proper TL;DR or abstract should highlight the key points and contributions of the work. If you could provide more context about the paper topic, research questions, methods, and findings, I may be able to generate a concise summary. For now, the best I can do is say: This paper presents research related to some topic, likely makes contributions of interest to that field, and has findings that advance knowledge in that area. But without the full details, it's hard to summarize meaningfully in one sentence. Please provide more information about the paper if you would like me to summarize it.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field:- It is the first study to directly compare bias between humans and machine learning models on facial recognition tasks. Prior work has studied bias in facial recognition systems, but hasn't compared it to human performance. This fills an important gap in understanding how algorithmic bias compares to human tendencies.- The study uses a novel hand-curated dataset to generate challenging facial verification and identification questions. Many prior studies use standard datasets like LFW and CelebA which have flaws like duplicated images that can distort accuracy measurements. Creating a cleaner dataset helps provide more robust bias evaluations.- The paper finds that algorithms outperform non-expert humans on both tasks, but exhibit biases (on gender and skin type) that are comparable to human test takers. This reinforces findings that machines exceed human accuracy, while providing new insight that they display similar baseline biases.- The survey methodology collects responses from a large, demographically diverse sample to better represent real-world diversity. Many papers use small or homogeneous groups when evaluating human performance.- The analysis compares multiple academic models as well as commercial APIs. Looking at both self-trained models and black-box systems provides a more comprehensive view of algorithmic bias.Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions to understanding facial recognition bias by directly comparing humans and machines in a rigorous manner using improved datasets and survey methods. The key novelty is the side-by-side algorithm-human comparison on bias, going beyond just auditing algorithms.
