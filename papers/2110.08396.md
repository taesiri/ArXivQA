# [Comparing Human and Machine Bias in Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08396)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:1) How and to what extent do humans exhibit bias in their accuracy on facial recognition tasks like identification and verification? (RQ1) 2) How does the bias exhibited by humans compare to the bias exhibited by machine learning models on the same facial recognition tasks? (RQ2)The key hypotheses appear to be:- Both humans and machine learning models will exhibit biases related to gender and skin tone in their facial recognition accuracy. - The magnitude of these biases will be comparable between humans and machines.- Humans will perform better on facial recognition tasks involving subjects that match their own demographics.So in summary, the central questions have to do with measuring and comparing biases in facial recognition between humans and machine learning models. The hypotheses predict that both groups will show biases, but they will be similar in magnitude, and humans will be better at recognizing faces like their own. The experiments and analysis are designed to test these hypotheses.
