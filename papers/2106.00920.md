# [DialoGraph: Incorporating Interpretable Strategy-Graph Networks into   Negotiation Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00920)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to incorporate interpretable strategy-graph networks into negotiation dialogues to improve pragmatic reasoning and strategic planning. 

The key hypothesis is that modeling the sequence of negotiation strategies and their dependencies as graph structures using graph neural networks can:

1) Enable improved and interpretable prediction of next optimal strategies given the dialogue context.

2) Outperform prior state-of-the-art negotiation models that use Finite State Transducers or RNNs to incorporate strategic context. 

3) Provide intermediate graph structures that allow interpreting and analyzing the interactions between different strategies contextualized in the dialogue.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the graph structure of negotiation strategies can lead to better strategy prediction, dialog generation, and interpretability compared to prior sequence modeling methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through quantitative experiments and qualitative analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing DialoGraph, a novel negotiation dialogue system that models pragmatic negotiation strategies using Graph Neural Networks (specifically Graph Attention Networks with hierarchical pooling). This allows the model to learn sequences of negotiation strategies jointly with the dialogue context. 

2. Incorporating the graph-based model of negotiation strategies into an end-to-end negotiation dialogue system. The graph representations of strategies are used to predict future strategies given the dialogue context, and this prediction is used to condition the utterance decoder to generate the next response.

3. Demonstrating improved performance over prior state-of-the-art methods on strategy prediction and downstream dialogue generation tasks. The graph-based method outperforms Finite State Transducer and RNN-based encoders on modeling negotiation strategies. It also leads to better performance on response generation and outcome prediction compared to hierarchical encoder-decoder baselines.

4. Providing interpretability for the negotiation dialogue system via the intermediate graph structures. The attention scores from the graph model can be used to analyze dependencies between strategies and their relative importance. This contrasts with prior work using RNNs/Transformers that lack such interpretability.

5. Proposing a modularized framework that incorporates the graph-based strategy encoder, making it applicable to other dialogue tasks that involve modeling sequences of latent strategies or pragmatics.

In summary, the key innovation is using graph neural networks to explicitly model negotiation strategies in an interpretable manner, and incorporating this into an end-to-end negotiation dialogue system. The benefits are improved performance over prior methods and the ability to interpret the model's strategic reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes DialoGraph, a graph neural network-based method to model negotiation strategies and their dependencies in dialogues, which outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in predicting negotiation strategies and generates better dialogue responses leading to improved negotiation outcomes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper presents a novel method, DialoGraph, for incorporating interpretable strategy graphs into negotiation dialog systems using graph neural networks. Most prior work on negotiation dialog systems has relied on less interpretable models like RNNs or more limited models like finite state transducers. Using graph neural networks to model the sequence of negotiation strategies is an innovative way to make the strategy modeling component more expressive while retaining interpretability.

- DialoGraph outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods like FST-based and RNN-based models on both intrinsic metrics like strategy prediction and dialog act prediction as well as downstream metrics like dialog response generation and negotiation outcome prediction. This demonstrates that the graph-based approach provides benefits over prior strategy modeling techniques.

- The paper shows both quantitative and qualitative results highlighting the interpretability of the learned strategy graphs in DialoGraph. This interpretability is a key advantage compared to other neural models commonly used in dialog systems. The analysis of strategy associations and influences enabled by inspecting the graph structure provides insights into negotiation behavior that would not be possible with less interpretable models.

- The incorporation of explicit strategy modeling as a component in an end-to-end dialog system is a useful modular framework applicable to other goal-oriented dialog tasks. Prior work has not explored explicit graph-based modeling of dialogue strategies jointly with end-to-end dialog training.

- Compared to other applications of graph neural networks in NLP, this paper uniquely applies graph networks to model sequential dialogue strategies as opposed to encoding parse trees or knowledge graphs. The sequential graph structure modeled here differs from how graph neural networks are typically used.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel graph-based approach to strategy modeling that achieves stronger performance and interpretability compared to prior work in negotiation dialog systems. The general framework of incorporating explicit graph-based strategy models in end-to-end dialog systems is also an interesting direction for future research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing models that can handle more complex negotiation scenarios with multiple issues at stake. The paper focuses on simple price negotiation scenarios. The authors suggest extending the models to negotiate over multiple attributes like product features, delivery terms, etc.

- Incorporating commonsense reasoning and world knowledge into models. Human negotiations involve reasoning about interests, relationships, norms etc. which are not captured in the current data-driven models. Integrating external commonsense knowledge could make models more human-like.

- Exploring different network architectures like graph convolutional networks, graph transformers etc. for representing the strategy sequences. The current GAT model could be replaced with more advanced graph neural networks.

- Evaluating how well the learned intermediate graph representations correlate with human annotations and perceptions. The authors suggest further analysis of the interpretability of the graph structures.

- Building personalized negotiation agents that can adapt their behavior and strategies based on the negotiation partner. The current models are not personalized.

- Developing negotiation coach systems that can provide real-time personalized strategy recommendations by analyzing the ongoing dialogue and negotiation graphs.

- Extending the framework to other non-collaborative goal-oriented tasks like persuasion, interviewing, etc. that require pragmatic reasoning.

In summary, the main directions are: expanding to more complex scenarios, integrating reasoning and world knowledge, evaluating interpretability, personalization, building applied systems like coaches, and extending to other pragmatic tasks.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents DialoGraph, a new dialogue system for negotiation dialogues. DialoGraph uses graph neural networks to model the sequence of negotiation strategies and their dependencies as graph structures. It has three main components: a hierarchical dialogue encoder to learn representations for each utterance, a structure encoder using graph attention networks to encode sequences of negotiation strategies/dialogue acts, and an utterance decoder to generate responses. 

DialoGraph outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on strategy prediction and downstream dialogue generation tasks. It also provides interpretability by visualizing the intermediate graph structures and attention scores, which reveals insights about associations and dependencies between strategies. The authors demonstrate DialoGraph in a buyer-seller negotiation setting and show it achieves better deals through more effective strategy use. DialoGraph combines the benefits of explicit graph-based modeling and end-to-end learning for strategic dialogue.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents DialoGraph, a graph-based negotiation system that models the sequence of strategies and their dependencies in negotiation dialogues using graph neural networks. DialoGraph incorporates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with hierarchical pooling to learn associations between negotiation strategies, including conceptual and linguistic strategies and dialogue acts, and their relative importance in predicting the best sequence. The graph connects each strategy to all previously occurring strategies, enabling direct connections from all previous strategies to more recent ones. DialoGraph encodes the graph using a hierarchical graph pooling based encoder to obtain structural representations of the strategies and dialogue acts. These structural representations are used to predict the next set of strategies and dialogue acts, as well as enrich the dialogue context representation. The enriched representation is then passed to a decoder to generate the next utterance in the negotiation dialogue. By explicitly modeling the dependencies between sequences of strategies with a graph-based method, DialoGraph is able to improve performance on strategy prediction and downstream dialogue generation compared to prior state-of-the-art negotiation dialogue systems.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is introducing a new model called DialoGraph for negotiation dialogue systems. The key ideas and problems addressed are:

1) Negotiation requires understanding pragmatic strategies and reasoning about them, beyond just generating fluent responses. Current dialogue systems are lacking in modeling negotiation strategies explicitly.

2) Prior work has used finite state transducers (FSTs) or RNNs to model negotiation strategies, but they have limitations in expressivity or interpretability. 

3) The paper proposes using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model sequences of negotiation strategies as graphs. GNNs can combine the benefits of interpretability and expressivity compared to FSTs and RNNs.

4) DialoGraph incorporates GNNs with hierarchical pooling to learn representations of negotiation strategy sequences, while also encoding the dialogue history. This allows jointly learning the pragmatics of strategies along with dialog context.

5) The paper shows DialoGraph outperforms prior RNN- and FST-based models in predicting negotiation strategies and generating better negotiation dialogues. The graph structure also enables interpreting the model's learned associations between strategies.

In summary, the key focus is developing more pragmatic negotiation dialogue agents by explicitly modeling negotiation strategies as interpretable graph structures using graph neural networks. This improves both the accuracy and interpretability compared to prior sequence modeling methods.
