# DialoGraph: Incorporating Interpretable Strategy-Graph Networks into   Negotiation Dialogues

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to incorporate interpretable strategy-graph networks into negotiation dialogues to improve pragmatic reasoning and strategic planning. The key hypothesis is that modeling the sequence of negotiation strategies and their dependencies as graph structures using graph neural networks can:1) Enable improved and interpretable prediction of next optimal strategies given the dialogue context.2) Outperform prior state-of-the-art negotiation models that use Finite State Transducers or RNNs to incorporate strategic context. 3) Provide intermediate graph structures that allow interpreting and analyzing the interactions between different strategies contextualized in the dialogue.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly modeling the graph structure of negotiation strategies can lead to better strategy prediction, dialog generation, and interpretability compared to prior sequence modeling methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through quantitative experiments and qualitative analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing DialoGraph, a novel negotiation dialogue system that models pragmatic negotiation strategies using Graph Neural Networks (specifically Graph Attention Networks with hierarchical pooling). This allows the model to learn sequences of negotiation strategies jointly with the dialogue context. 2. Incorporating the graph-based model of negotiation strategies into an end-to-end negotiation dialogue system. The graph representations of strategies are used to predict future strategies given the dialogue context, and this prediction is used to condition the utterance decoder to generate the next response.3. Demonstrating improved performance over prior state-of-the-art methods on strategy prediction and downstream dialogue generation tasks. The graph-based method outperforms Finite State Transducer and RNN-based encoders on modeling negotiation strategies. It also leads to better performance on response generation and outcome prediction compared to hierarchical encoder-decoder baselines.4. Providing interpretability for the negotiation dialogue system via the intermediate graph structures. The attention scores from the graph model can be used to analyze dependencies between strategies and their relative importance. This contrasts with prior work using RNNs/Transformers that lack such interpretability.5. Proposing a modularized framework that incorporates the graph-based strategy encoder, making it applicable to other dialogue tasks that involve modeling sequences of latent strategies or pragmatics.In summary, the key innovation is using graph neural networks to explicitly model negotiation strategies in an interpretable manner, and incorporating this into an end-to-end negotiation dialogue system. The benefits are improved performance over prior methods and the ability to interpret the model's strategic reasoning.
