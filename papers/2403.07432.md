# [Bring Event into RGB and LiDAR: Hierarchical Visual-Motion Fusion for   Scene Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07432)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing scene flow methods rely on single RGB or LiDAR modality, which have degraded visual features due to limitations like low dynamic range (RGB) or incomplete structure (LiDAR). This deteriorates motion features.
- Multimodal fusion methods directly fuse RGB and LiDAR features but suffer from modality gap due to their heterogeneous nature, also deteriorating motion features.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce event camera as a bridge between RGB and LiDAR since it has complementary nature with both in visual (luminance, structure) and motion (correlation) spaces.
- Propose hierarchical visual-motion fusion framework VisMoFlow to fuse cross-modal knowledge in homogeneous spaces:
  - Visual Luminance Fusion: Fuse relative luminance of event and absolute luminance of RGB for high dynamic range imaging.
  - Visual Structure Fusion: Fuse local boundary of event and global shape of LiDAR for structure integrity.
  - Motion Correlation Fusion: Fuse spatial-dense correlation of RGB, temporal-dense correlation of event and sparse correlation of LiDAR for motion continuity.

Main Contributions:
- First to bring event camera as a bridge between RGB and LiDAR and propose hierarchical fusion in homogeneous spaces for interpretable cross-modal fusion. 
- Discover complementarity of event with RGB and LiDAR in both visual (luminance, structure) and motion (correlation) spaces.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on day and night scene flow estimation by progressive fusion from visual space to motion space.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a hierarchical visual-motion fusion framework that uses event camera data as a bridge to fuse complementary knowledge from RGB, event, and LiDAR data in homogeneous spaces to improve scene flow estimation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It brings the event camera as a bridge between RGB and LiDAR modalities, and proposes a novel hierarchical visual-motion fusion framework for scene flow. This framework can explicitly fuse the multimodal complementary knowledge to progressively improve scene flow estimation from visual space to motion space.

2. It reveals that RGB, event, and LiDAR modalities have complementary knowledge in both visual homogeneous spaces (luminance and structure) as well as motion homogeneous space (correlation). This makes the multimodal fusion process more physically interpretable. 

3. It conducts extensive experiments on daytime and nighttime scenes to verify that the proposed VisMoFlow method achieves state-of-the-art performance for all-day scene flow estimation.

In summary, the key contribution is using event camera as a bridge modality to enable effective hierarchical fusion of visual and motion information from RGB, event, and LiDAR data for improving scene flow estimation. The fusion is performed in homogeneous spaces to make it more interpretable.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Scene flow - The paper focuses on estimating 3D motion vectors representing scene flow from multimodal sensor data (RGB, LiDAR, event cameras). 

- Multimodal fusion - Fusing complementary visual and motion information from RGB images, LiDAR point clouds, and event cameras in a hierarchical framework.

- Homogeneous spaces - Defining luminance, structure, and correlation spaces to fuse multimodal data in order to handle modality gaps. 

- Event camera - Using event cameras as a bridge modality between RGB images and LiDAR due to their complementary nature.

- Hierarchical fusion - Progressively fusing information in a visual luminance fusion stage, visual structure fusion stage, and motion correlation fusion stage.

- Daytime and nighttime scenes - Evaluating the proposed VisMoFlow method on scene flow estimation in both day and night conditions.

The key ideas are using event cameras to bridge the gap between visual and LiDAR data, fusing information in homogeneous spaces to avoid modality gaps, and hierarchical fusion of complementary multimodal data for robust scene flow estimation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions discovering that event has a homogeneous nature with RGB and LiDAR in both visual and motion spaces. Can you elaborate more on what specific properties make their nature homogeneous? 

2. In visual luminance fusion, you fuse the relative luminance of events and absolute luminance of RGB. What tradeoffs did you consider in deciding the weights to give to each in the fusion?

3. You mention using spatiotemporal gradient consistency to constrain the RGB-event fusion process. Why is maintaining motion/temporal consistency so important in fusing the visual features?

4. For visual structure fusion between events and LiDAR, what other alternatives did you explore for clustering features besides self-similarity clustering before deciding on this method?

5. What were some difficulties you faced in aligning the motion distributions of RGB, events, and LiDAR using KL divergence for correlation fusion? How did you tweak the formulation to make it effective?

6. The hierarchical fusion approach progresses from visual space to motion space. What would be the disadvantages of directly fusing features in motion space without going through visual fusion stages first?

7. You fuse dense spatial correlations from RGB and dense temporal correlations from events. What is lacking in LiDAR correlations that requires fusing the other two modalities?  

8. For real-time applications, which components of your pipeline are most computationally expensive? How can they be optimized further?

9. The scheme relies on having alignment between RGB, events, and LiDAR. When alignment degrades, have you studied how each fusion stage is impacted?

10. You currently handle only rigid scenes. How would you extend the fusion approach for non-rigid scenes with independent object motions?
