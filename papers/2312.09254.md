# [Revisiting Depth Completion from a Stereo Matching Perspective for   Cross-domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09254)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points and contributions of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called VPP4DC for depth completion that aims to achieve robustness across domains and datasets. It casts depth completion as a virtual stereo correspondence problem by generating fictitious stereo image pairs from the input sparse depth map. These virtual images contain projected patterns at sparse points based on their depth, enabling the use of stereo matching networks to densify the depth. Compared to existing depth completion networks that purely rely on monocular and contextual cues, this stereo view approach exploits the generalization capability and robust matching from state-of-the-art stereo methods like RAFT-Stereo. Through extensive experiments, VPP4DC demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization ability between synthetic and real datasets as well as across different real-world datasets, significantly outperforming existing depth completion networks. At the same time, it achieves competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art specialized networks when tested on the same domains used for training. The proposed virtual stereo view idea and findings can help advance research towards deployable depth completion solutions for diverse practical applications. The main contributions are: (1) novel formulation of depth completion as a virtual stereo matching problem for robustness, (2) extensive benchmarking that reveals limitations of existing methods, and (3) state-of-the-art cross-domain depth completion performance coupled with competitiveness on individual datasets.
