# [Value Explicit Pretraining for Goal-Based Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12339)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transferring policies learned on one task to novel but related unseen tasks is an important challenge in reinforcement learning. Differences in dynamics and appearances make this difficult.

- Existing methods like time contrastive networks, value implicit pretraining, etc have limitations in enabling effective transfer to new tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a method to learn task-agnostic state representations based on value function estimates from sequences of observations. 

- Use the final frame in each sequence as a "goal state". Compute value estimates of all states based on discounted sum of rewards to this goal state using Bellman equation.

- Sample anchor, positive and negative states across different but related tasks. Use triplet loss to embed anchor and positive states closer together compared to negatives, based on proximity of their value estimates.

- Learn an encoder that maps observations to this value-based embedding space in a task-agnostic way.

Key Contributions:

- Novel pre-training approach to enable policy transfer across related tasks by using value estimates to related states instead of just visual properties.

- Demonstrated superior transfer performance to unseen Shoot'em up Atari games compared to prior arts like Time Contrastive Networks, Value Implicit Pretraining etc.

- Formulated a common goal-based objective for sequences across different but related Shoot'em up games to enable learning task-agnostic value-based state representations.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage value estimates rather than just observations to relate states across tasks and enable policy transfer to new games in the same genre. The results demonstrate stronger zero-shot transfer over existing pre-training techniques.
