# [AE-NeRF: Audio Enhanced Neural Radiance Field for Few Shot Talking Head   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10921)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Audio-driven talking head synthesis aims to generate a photo-realistic video of a person talking based on an audio clip. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods have shown promising quality. 
- However, they require a large dataset of talking videos per identity for training which is not practical. When only a few seconds of video is available (few-shot setting), two key issues emerge:
   1) Lack of a facial prior model that can provide basic face texture, shape, etc to enable fast adaptation to new identities with few data.
   2) Modeling the whole face conditioned on audio causes misalignment between visual and audio. Different face regions have different correlations with audio.

Proposed Solution - Audio Enhanced NeRF (AE-NeRF):
- Pretrains a base model on a multi-identity talking head dataset to learn a strong facial prior. 
- Proposes Audio Aware Aggregation (AAA) module to fuse features from reference images. It uses cross attention between reference audio and target audio to assign higher weights to reference images with more similar audio content to the target. This leads to a better prior.
- Decouples the face into audio-associated (lower face) and audio-independent (upper face) regions modeled by two separate NeRFs. Only the lower face NeRF conditions on audio signal. This audio-aligned face generation brings better audio-visual synchronization.

Key Contributions:
- AAA module for learning a robust facial prior by considering audio similarity between reference and target images.
- Dual NeRF strategy to model audio-associated and independent face regions separately for better audio-visual alignment.
- State-of-the-art performance on few-shot talking head synthesis in terms of visual quality, audio-lip sync, and generalization ability.

In summary, the paper presents an audio-enhanced neural radiance field approach for high quality few-shot talking head generation by effectively learning from multi-identity data and modeling different face regions' correlation with audio.
