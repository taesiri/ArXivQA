# [Two-step Automated Cybercrime Coded Word Detection using Multi-level   Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10838)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cybercrime coded words (C3 words) are used by criminals to secretly communicate and avoid detection. These are ordinary sounding words that take on hidden criminal meanings (e.g. using "ice" to mean methamphetamine). 
- Detecting new C3 words is challenging due to insufficient labeled training data and because the words lack context that language models rely on.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-step approach to C3 word detection using semi-supervised multi-level representation learning with autoencoders.

First Step:
- Construct a mean latent vector for each cybercrime type (e.g. drugs, sex crimes) from a small labeled dataset using one of 5 autoencoder models - SAE, AAE, DAE, VAE or SDAE.

Second Step: 
- Given a new document, encode sentences to vectors and classify as a cybercrime type by similarity to mean vectors.
- Tokenize classified sentences and encode each word. If word vector is similar to a crime's mean vector and word is missing from the dictionary, add it as a new C3 word.

Additionally:
- Propose 3 methods to understand detected C3 words:
   1) Identify newly coined words from outlier latent vectors
   2) Find words used across multiple cybercrime types  
   3) Automatically build a taxonomy of C3 words

Main Contributions:
- A novel two-step C3 word detection approach using multi-level representation learning with autoencoders
- 3 methods to deeply understand detected C3 words
- Experimental results showing the two-step approach outperforms baselines like Dark-GloVe and Dark-BERT with an F1-score of 0.991.
- Analysis of detected words provides further understanding of cybercrimes.
