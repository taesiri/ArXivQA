# [Defining Effective Engagement For Enhancing Cancer Patients' Well-being   with Mobile Digital Behavior Change Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12007)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating the effectiveness of digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) for cancer patients is important but there is limited guidance, especially for small-scale studies with ethical constraints. 
- Key questions include: How to measure engagement? What is the impact of clinician prescriptions? What constitutes "effective engagement"? Can we predict outcomes?

Proposed Solution:
- Use a multifaceted approach with self-reports, smartwatch data, questionnaires to assess micro- and macro-level engagement.
- Analyze engagement and outcomes between groups of patients prescribed DBCIs versus not. 
- Identify metrics and patterns linking engagement to outcomes.
- Build machine learning model to predict outcomes.

Key Contributions:
- Clinician prescription significantly increases sustained engagement with mobile DBCIs
- For cancer patients, 1 weekly engagement with a DBCI may maintain well-being but 2 weekly engagements may be needed to increase intrinsic motivation
- Initial functioning levels are most predictive of outcomes; higher engagement is associated with increased motivation
- Causal links between engagement and outcomes are difficult to establish in small uncontrolled studies

In summary, the paper analyzes data from the CAPABLE study to define metrics and patterns of "effective engagement" with DBCIs for cancer patients. A mix of self-reports, sensor data and questionnaires revealed that clinician prescriptions increase engagement. At least weekly engagement maintains functioning while higher engagement may increase intrinsic motivation. The limitations of a small, uncontrolled study made causal outcome analysis difficult but initial functioning strongly predicts outcomes. The findings provide guidance for designing and assessing cancer patient DBCIs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper defines effective engagement with mobile behavior change interventions for cancer patients, finding that clinician prescriptions significantly increase sustained engagement and that while one weekly engagement suffices to maintain well-being, transitioning motivation may require higher engagement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes a methodology and sequence of research questions for evaluating the effectiveness of digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) in the context of a small-scale study with cancer patients. Specifically, it focuses on defining "effective engagement" with mobile DBCIs aimed at enhancing cancer patients' wellbeing and quality of life. 

The key aspects of the proposed methodology include:

- Examining the impact of clinician prescription versus autonomous engagement with DBCIs 

- Associating engagement levels (micro-level) with outcomes related to quality of life (macro-level) 

- Defining weekly engagement levels that are "effective" for maintaining or improving patient wellbeing

- Evaluating whether engagement can predict improvements in motivation and functioning

- Identifying predictive factors based on enrollment data that can indicate potential for improvement

The paper applies this methodology based on data from the CAPABLE study of a mobile app for cancer patients. It provides specific findings around engagement patterns and suggestions for minimum effective weekly engagement. Overall, it offers guidance and a sequence of research questions for assessing DBCI effectiveness in small-scale cancer patient studies with ethical constraints.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs)
- Cancer patients
- Well-being 
- Quality of life (QoL)
- Engagement 
- Effectiveness evaluation
- Mobile health (mHealth)
- EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire

The paper discusses evaluating the effectiveness of mobile phone-based digital interventions aimed at changing behaviors to improve the well-being and quality of life of cancer patients. It examines metrics and methodologies for assessing user engagement with these digital tools at both micro and macro levels. Key aspects explored include the impact of clinician prescription of specific app modules ("capsules") on patient engagement, the relationship between engagement and outcomes, and predicting outcomes based on initial data. The analysis leverages self-reported app usage logs, smartwatch sensor data, and standardized health questionnaires like the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BREQ-2.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a sequence of 7 research questions (RQs) to evaluate the effectiveness of digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). Could you explain the rationale behind this approach and why a sequence of hypotheses is proposed rather than a single hypothesis? 

2. RQ1 explores whether capsule prescription by clinicians increases patient engagement with DBCIs. What are some alternative explanations for the higher engagement levels observed in prescribed patients? How could the analysis be extended to better establish causality?

3. The combined analysis of self-reported and device-inferred walking data reveals discrepancies in some cases. What could explain this and how may it impact the assessment of engagement levels? Are there methods to reconcile such discrepant data sources?  

4. The paper suggests one weekly engagement is needed to simply maintain functioning while intrinsic motivation requires higher engagement. What theories relate frequency and type of motivation? How could the threshold for intrinsic motivation be better established?

5. RQ4 attempts to relate walking engagement and QoL changes to infer causality but finds no significant effect. What are some alternative statistical approaches better suited to inferring causality from observational data?  

6. The predictive model utilizes initial functioning scores and demographics but not engagement features. Why do engagement features fail to improve predictions? What data would allow linking engagement to outcomes?

7. The lack of a control group makes it hard to isolate the effects of the intervention itself. How could the study design be improved to establish an appropriate control for comparison? What are ethical considerations in using controls here?

8. The study finds sustained engagement is enhanced by clinician prescription. How may we assess if this prescription itself or other factors drive this effect? What data could help clarify this?

9. The small sample size poses challenges in reliably evaluating effects and statistical power is limited. What is the minimum sample size needed to reliably detect effects of interest?

10. Patients showed high initial functioning scores, limiting room for improvement. How may patients be screened to obtain a more representative distribution of functioning scores? What biases might this introduce?
