## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach to personalized human pose forecasting, which aims to predict the future articulated poses of a specific individual over time given their past motion. Rather than training models on generic human motion data to predict an "average" human's future motion as in existing benchmarks, the authors argue that practical human-computer interaction systems will observe individuals for extended periods and should adapt predictions to their distinct motion patterns. They show state-of-the-art neural networks fail to effectively leverage increased observation windows during training for personalization. As an alternative lightweight, trainable approach, they demonstrate simple autoregressive time series models with hundreds of parameters can achieve comparable performance to neural networks with over 14 million parameters on a standard benchmark dataset. The authors then use these efficient autoregressive models in a novel way - by fitting them to the residuals of neural network forecasts at test time. This recursive scheme leverages the power of neural networks for average human motion trends while adapting to individuals, significantly improving state-of-the-art performance for short-term personalized pose forecasting without retraining the full model.
