# [KazSAnDRA: Kazakh Sentiment Analysis Dataset of Reviews and Attitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentiment analysis is an important natural language processing task with many applications, but research has predominantly focused on English. Lower-resourced languages like Kazakh lack datasets and models for sentiment analysis.
- There is a lack of publicly available Kazakh sentiment analysis datasets, limiting research progress. Existing studies use small datasets and do not release them publicly.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present KazSAnDRA, the first large-scale (180,064 reviews) public Kazakh sentiment analysis dataset spanning four domains. 
- Reviews have numeric ratings from 1-5 representing attitudes. The dataset has train/validation/test splits to facilitate benchmarking.
- They develop and evaluate four Transformer-based models on KazSAnDRA for binary polarity classification and 5-way score classification. Models are fine-tuned on balanced and imbalanced versions of the training set.

Main Contributions:
- KazSAnDRA - the first and largest public Kazakh sentiment analysis dataset
- Analysis of dataset properties: score distribution, Cyrillic/Latin scripts, spelling variations, code-switching
- Benchmark sentiment classification results using state-of-the-art models - best F1 scores are 0.81 for polarity and 0.39 for 5-way score classification
- Identification of challenges unique to Kazakh, e.g. code-switching, that impact performance and should be addressed in future work
- The dataset and code are publicly released to enable further research progress on Kazakh sentiment analysis

In summary, this paper makes an important contribution by releasing the first large-scale public Kazakh sentiment dataset and establishing benchmark results, facilitating future research to address unique challenges in Kazakh sentiment analysis.
