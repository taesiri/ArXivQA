# [A Knowledge-Injected Curriculum Pretraining Framework for Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) requires exploiting knowledge graphs (KGs) to answer natural language questions. Pretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results but still face challenges in comprehensive knowledge learning and complex reasoning over multiple knowledge facts. Existing methods converting KGs to corpus for LM pretraining often depend on specific techniques/resources, focus more on knowledge injection rather than reasoning, and may hurt natural language understanding of LMs.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a general Knowledge-Injected Curriculum Pretraining (KICP) framework to achieve comprehensive KG learning and exploitation for KBQA. It consists of:

1) Knowledge Injection module that converts KG triples to sentences as pretraining corpus via three key steps - text characterization, sentence construction, masking. This generalizes various techniques. 

2) Knowledge Adaptation module that keeps original LM fixed to retain natural language understanding, and adds an adapter module above it to learn knowledge.

3) Curriculum Reasoning module that follows human reasoning patterns to construct easy-hard corpora requiring reasoning over KG facts. It pretrains LM from easy to hard to enable complex reasoning.

Main Contributions:
- A general framework to incorporate knowledge graphs into language models for question answering without relying on specific techniques
- Knowledge adapter to reduce negative impacts of synthesized sentences on language understanding
- Curriculum learning strategy to incrementally teach the model complex reasoning patterns
- Experiments showing improved performance over strong baselines on multiple QA datasets  

The framework provides more comprehensive knowledge learning, protects language understanding, and equips the model with better reasoning ability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a general framework for knowledge-injected curriculum pretraining of language models to achieve comprehensive knowledge graph learning and complex reasoning ability for question answering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a general Knowledge-Injected Curriculum Pretraining (KICP) framework to achieve comprehensive knowledge graph learning and exploitation for knowledge-based question answering. The framework is composed of three key components - knowledge injection, knowledge adaptation, and curriculum reasoning.

2) The knowledge injection module generalizes the process of converting knowledge graph triples into sentences for pretraining corpus into three key steps - text characterization, sentence construction, and masking. This allows the framework to work with different implementations for flexible application.

3) The knowledge adaptation module reduces the negative impacts of differences between the generated corpus and natural corpus by keeping the natural language understanding ability of the language model fixed and adding a trainable adapter to learn knowledge. 

4) The curriculum reasoning module enables the language model with human-like complex reasoning ability by constructing reasoning-required corpora with increasing difficulties and training the model from easy to hard following curriculum learning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a general framework for comprehensive knowledge graph learning and reasoning to improve language models for question answering tasks. The framework can work with different techniques, focuses on both language understanding and reasoning, and employs curriculum learning to reduce training difficulty.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Knowledge-based question answering (KBQA)
- Knowledge graphs (KGs)
- Pretrained language models (LMs) 
- Knowledge injection (KI)
- Knowledge adaptation (KA)
- Curriculum reasoning (CR)
- Knowledge-Injected Curriculum Pretraining (KICP) framework
- Generating KG-centered pretraining corpus
- Reducing negative impacts of generated vs natural corpus
- Enabling LMs with complex reasoning abilities
- Curriculum learning with increasing reasoning difficulties
- Improving performance on KBQA datasets

The paper proposes the KICP framework to achieve comprehensive knowledge learning and exploitation from KGs for question answering. The key ideas include injecting KGs into LMs by converting them to pretraining sentences, adapting LMs to reduce negative impacts, and pretraining LMs for complex reasoning with curriculum learning. The goal is to improve LM performance on KBQA tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The Knowledge Injection (KI) module generalizes the sentence generation process into three key steps. Can you explain each of these steps and how they enable flexible application of different techniques to inject knowledge into the language model?

2. The paper claims that the generated corpus from the KI module differs from natural language, which may have negative effects during pretraining. How does the Knowledge Adaptation (KA) module try to address this issue while still allowing knowledge from the generated corpus to be learned? 

3. How does the Curriculum Reasoning (CR) module aim to reduce the difficulties in pretraining the language model for complex reasoning, and why is this important? Explain the different lessons constructed as part of curriculum learning.

4. The paper provides an implementation for the general KICP framework. What techniques are used for text characterization, sentence construction, and masking in the KI module implementation? How is knowledge adapter Ad implemented in KA?

5. How are the relations for multi-hop and multi-object reasoning defined such that they meet predefined pattern requirements for constructing the pretraining corpus in CR? Explain the complex composition process for both.  

6. Why was it necessary to split CR pretraining into lessons on knowledge learning, CoT learning, and composition learning? What does each lesson aim to teach the language model in preparation for complex reasoning?

7. How does the pretrained model under KICP get fine-tuned on downstream QA tasks? What modules get fine-tuned and what stays fixed?

8. What are some limitations of the KICP framework and generated corpus that could be addressed in future work to make it more robust? How can KICP be extended to generative language models?  

9. What was the motivation behind introducing knowledge adaptation in KICP versus directly training the language model parameters? What advantage does this provide?

10. Could other human reasoning patterns beyond multi-hop and multi-object be easily incorporated into the curriculum reasoning module? Why or why not? How would the implementation need to change?
