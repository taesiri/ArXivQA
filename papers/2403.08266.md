# [Sketch2Manga: Shaded Manga Screening from Sketch with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08266)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manga screening (adding screentones to manga sketches) is a tedious process for artists. There are no existing automatic methods tailored for manga screening that can generate high-quality shaded screentones. 
- Existing sketch-to-manga methods rely on additional inputs like reference images or produce low-quality unshaded screentones.
- Existing illustration-to-manga methods struggle with rich color regions and consistently generate manga with low contrast or unnatural shading.

Proposed Solution:
- A sketch-to-manga framework with a color illustration as an intermediary between the sketch and manga domains.
- A two-step approach:
   1) Generate a color illustration from the sketch using a text-to-image diffusion model.
   2) Generate a manga with shaded screentones from the color illustration's intensity map using a tailored latent diffusion model finetuned on high-quality manga data.
- Finetune the VAE and U-Net components of Stable Diffusion with a manga dataset and custom loss (without LPIP loss).
- Intensity map of color illustration used as conditional input during diffusion to align screentones with shading.  
- An adaptive scaling method to integrate the generated screentones into the color illustration while preserving shading details.

Main Contributions:
- First fully automatic sketch-to-manga approach for generating high-quality manga with shaded, high-frequency screentones.
- A finetuned latent diffusion model conditioned on intensity guidance capable of producing quality screentones.
- An effective two-step intermediary approach over direct generation.
- An adaptive scaling technique to properly blend screentones and illustrations.

In summary, the paper proposes a tailored framework to automatically convert sketches to manga through an intermediary color illustration using intensitiy-guided diffusion models and adaptive scaling. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate superior manga generation ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel sketch to manga framework that generates high-quality manga with shaded high-frequency screentones by first generating a color illustration from the sketch and then generating a manga image conditioned on the intensity map of the color illustration using a tailored diffusion model finetuned on high-quality manga data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel sketch to manga framework that generates high-quality manga with shaded high-frequency screentones via a two-step approach with a color illustration serving as the intermediary.

2. Finetuning a diffusion model with a tailored loss function and intensity conditioning to generate high-quality screentones. 

3. Proposing an adaptive scaling method to integrate screentones into a color illustration to obtain the manga.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing a full pipeline to automatically convert a sketch into a manga image with high-quality shaded screentones. This involves generating a color illustration first and then leveraging that to guide the generation of the manga image. Both the diffusion model and the scaling method are tailored specifically for high-quality manga generation.

The paper proposes a novel framework for automatically generating manga images with screentones from input sketches. Key aspects include: finetuning diffusion models on manga data to generate high-quality screentones; using an intensity map from a colored sketch as conditional input to the diffusion model; an adaptive scaling method to integrate the generated screentones with the color sketch. Relevant terms reflect this focus on manga image synthesis, the use of diffusion models and finetuning strategies, and techniques to produce high-frequency shaded screentones matched to input sketches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes generating a color illustration from the input sketch first before converting it to manga. What is the rationale behind this two-step approach instead of directly generating manga from the sketch?

2. The paper finetunes both the VAE and U-Net components of Stable Diffusion. What specific changes were made to the loss functions and training process to enable high-quality manga generation? 

3. How does conditioning the latent diffusion model on the intensity map enable the generation of shaded high-frequency screentones compared to conditioning only on the sketch?

4. The paper scrapes and processes a large manga image dataset for finetuning. What are some key considerations and steps taken to ensure the quality and diversity of this dataset? 

5. Could you explain the adaptive scaling method in more detail? How does it help integrate the generated screentones with the color illustration effectively? 

6. What modifications could be made to the framework to allow consistent screentone patterns across different panels of a manga page while maintaining style diversity?

7. How suitable is the proposed framework for converting a cartoon or animation to manga styled visuals? What changes would be required?

8. What quantitative metrics were used to evaluate the manga generation quality besides user studies? How do the results compare?

9. How does the method address potential generation artifacts such as distortions or unnatural shadings?

10. What future extensions or applications of this work could explore to further improve the usefulness and adoption?
