# [Self-Supervised Learning of 3D Human Pose using Multi-view Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02330)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an accurate 3D human pose estimator using only 2D pose annotations, without requiring 3D ground truth data or camera calibration parameters?The key points are:- The authors aim to develop a 3D human pose estimation method that does not rely on scarce/costly 3D pose annotations or camera calibration data. - Their proposed method, EpipolarPose, uses only 2D pose annotations and epipolar geometry constraints to generate pseudo 3D poses for self-supervised training of a 3D pose estimator.- EpipolarPose sets new state-of-the-art results among weakly supervised/self-supervised 3D pose estimation methods on standard benchmarks.- The authors also propose a new evaluation metric, Pose Structure Score (PSS), to better assess structural/semantic plausibility of estimated poses.So in summary, the central research question is how to effectively learn 3D human pose estimation using only readily available 2D pose data, avoiding requirements for 3D ground truth or camera parameters. EpipolarPose is their proposed technique to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing EpipolarPose, a self-supervised method for 3D human pose estimation from multi-view images. EpipolarPose does not require any 3D ground truth data or camera extrinsics. It utilizes epipolar geometry and 2D poses from multiple views to generate 3D supervision for training a 3D pose estimator.- Achieving state-of-the-art results among weakly/self-supervised methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The trained 3D pose estimator outperforms previous self-supervised approaches by a large margin.- Introducing Pose Structure Score (PSS), a new performance measure for 3D human pose estimation. PSS assesses the structural plausibility of a predicted pose compared to its ground truth. It is more sensitive to structural errors than localization-based metrics like MPJPE.In summary, the main contribution is a self-supervised framework EpipolarPose for 3D human pose estimation, which does not require any 3D labels or camera parameters. It leverages multi-view geometry to create 3D supervision and trains high-quality 3D pose estimators. The paper also proposes a new performance metric PSS to better evaluate structural errors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised method called EpipolarPose that can predict 3D human pose from a single image without requiring any 3D ground truth data or camera extrinsics during training, instead utilizing epipolar geometry and 2D poses from multi-view images to generate training signal.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other research in 3D human pose estimation:- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new self-supervised method called EpipolarPose for training 3D pose estimators without requiring any 3D ground truth data or camera calibration information. This makes it more practical for real-world scenarios where obtaining 3D labels is difficult. - EpipolarPose leverages epipolar geometry constraints between multi-view images during training to generate 3D supervision. At test time, it can estimate 3D pose from a single image. The ability to learn from multi-view images without 3D labels makes it stand out from other self-supervised methods like [Rhodin et al. 2018] that still require some 3D data.- The paper shows state-of-the-art results among weakly supervised/self-supervised methods on standard 3D pose estimation benchmarks like Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.- Most other work in 3D pose estimation relies on full 3D supervision during training or requires camera calibration information. In contrast, this paper pushes the boundary of what can be achieved without any 3D labels at all.- The paper also proposes a new evaluation metric called Pose Structure Score (PSS) to better assess structural plausibility of estimated poses. This helps highlight that common localization-based metrics like MPJPE have limitations.Overall, this paper makes significant contributions in 3D pose estimation by developing a practical self-supervised training approach and showing strong results compared to methods requiring more supervision. The ideas could help enable 3D pose estimation in real-world unconstrained settings.
