# [Self-Supervised Learning of 3D Human Pose using Multi-view Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02330)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an accurate 3D human pose estimator using only 2D pose annotations, without requiring 3D ground truth data or camera calibration parameters?The key points are:- The authors aim to develop a 3D human pose estimation method that does not rely on scarce/costly 3D pose annotations or camera calibration data. - Their proposed method, EpipolarPose, uses only 2D pose annotations and epipolar geometry constraints to generate pseudo 3D poses for self-supervised training of a 3D pose estimator.- EpipolarPose sets new state-of-the-art results among weakly supervised/self-supervised 3D pose estimation methods on standard benchmarks.- The authors also propose a new evaluation metric, Pose Structure Score (PSS), to better assess structural/semantic plausibility of estimated poses.So in summary, the central research question is how to effectively learn 3D human pose estimation using only readily available 2D pose data, avoiding requirements for 3D ground truth or camera parameters. EpipolarPose is their proposed technique to address this question.
