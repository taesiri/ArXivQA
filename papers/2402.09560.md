# [Distribution-Free Rates in Neyman-Pearson Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09560)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of Neyman-Pearson classification, where the goal is to minimize error with respect to one distribution $\mu_1$, subject to having low error below a threshold $\alpha$ with respect to another distribution $\mu_0$. This models practical problems like disease detection or malware detection. The authors study the fundamental limits of this problem in a distribution-free setting, where the aim is to characterize minimax rates over all pairs of distributions $(\mu_0,\mu_1)$ for a given hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$.

Proposed Solution:
The authors provide a full characterization of possible minimax rates based on a dichotomy determined by whether $\mathcal{H}$ satisfies a simple geometric condition termed the "three-points-separation" condition. This condition loosely relates to the VC dimension of $\mathcal{H}$. 

If $\mathcal{H}$ satisfies three-points-separation, the minimax rate is $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{-1/2})$, matching known upper bounds. The authors provide the first tight lower bound establishing this rate.

If $\mathcal{H}$ does not satisfy three-points-separation, then subclasses $\mathcal{H}_\alpha(\mu_0)$ are highly structured. Rates are then faster than $n^{-1/2}$. Specifically:
- If $\mathcal{H}_\alpha(\mu_0)$ has a maximal element, the problem is trivial with 0 excess risk.  
- If no maximal element exists, minimax rate is $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{-1})$.

This dichotomy and faster rates are in contrast to standard classification. The results hold both when $\mu_0$ is known or unknown.

Main Contributions:
- A full characterization of minimax rates for Neyman-Pearson classification over a VC class $\mathcal{H}$.
- Introducing the three-points-separation condition that determines a dichotomy between fast and slow rates.
- Establishing an $\Omega(n^{-1/2})$ lower bound rate when the condition holds, matching known upper bounds. 
- Showing that rates can be faster than $n^{-1/2}$ when the condition fails, unlike in standard classification - highlighting a difference between the problems.
