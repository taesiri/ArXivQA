# [Making Sentence Embeddings Robust to User-Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17220)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- NLP models struggle on user-generated content (UGC) due to high lexical variance and deviations from standard text they are trained on. 
- LASER sentence embeddings are not robust to UGC - non-standard words do not have embeddings close to their standard counterparts.
- Tokenization differences between standard and UGC sentences also make it difficult to represent them in the same space.

Proposed Solution:
- Frame the problem as a bitext alignment issue - can a sentence encoder align a standard text with its non-standard version and embed them closely? 
- Train a student model to mimic LASER's embeddings of standard English sentences. Also train it to map non-standard versions of sentences close to the standard embeddings. 
- Use a mean squared error loss to minimize distance between standard, non-standard and LASER embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- Simple method to make sentence encoder robust to UGC by reducing distance between standard and UGC sentences
- RoLASER - a LASER student more robust to natural and synthetic UGC. Up to 11x better alignment of UGC.
- c-RoLASER - character-aware model also proposed but underperforms RoLASER
- Fine-grained analysis of model robustness to UGC types. RoLASER greatly outperforms on challenging types.
- Combination of data augmentation techniques to generate synthetic UGC for training and evaluation.

In summary, the paper focuses on improving sentence embedding robustness to UGC by training a student model to align UGC sentences close to their standard version. Both token-level and character-level models are explored. The token-level RoLASER outperforms LASER significantly across metrics and UGC types.
