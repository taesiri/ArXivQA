# [Towards Optimal Statistical Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07930)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a unified framework to model statistical watermarking schemes as hypothesis testing problems with random rejection regions. A key insight is using cryptographic techniques to couple the output distribution with the rejection region distribution, allowing for non-trivial trade-offs between type I and type II errors. The paper characterizes the uniformly most powerful (UMP) watermark and establishes tight bounds on the number of i.i.d. tokens required to achieve small error rates, improving previous $O(h^{-2})$ rates to $O(h^{-1}\log(1/h))$. Additionally, the concept of model-agnostic watermarking is introduced along with accompanying minimax analysis. The paper also formulates a robust watermarking problem to model user perturbations and uses a linear programming characterization of the optimal type II error. Overall, this is the first comprehensive statistical treatment of watermarking with near-optimal rates. The systematic framework and analysis provide key theoretical foundations that could enable further progress.
