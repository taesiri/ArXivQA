# [Learning to Name Classes for Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01830)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to make vision and language models less sensitive to the choice of handcrafted class names used in text queries, and improve their ability to adapt to new datasets. The key hypothesis is that by learning optimal class-specific word embeddings from visual content, rather than using predefined class names, the models can become more robust and performant.Specifically, the paper proposes to learn a new set of word embeddings to represent classes of interest, based on the available visual data. These learned embeddings can replace the original class names in text queries, removing dependence on potentially suboptimal or erroneous handcrafted names. The paper tests this hypothesis by evaluating the proposed approach on image classification and object detection tasks. The results demonstrate improved performance in various scenarios like model adaptation, open-vocabulary recognition, and continual learning. The paper also shows the interpretability benefits of learning class names, in terms of identifying model biases and labeling errors.In summary, the central hypothesis is that learning optimal class names from visual data can enhance vision-language models, making them more robust, accurate and interpretable. The experimental results validate this hypothesis across multiple tasks and datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a simple method to adapt large vision-language models to new datasets and address issues with class names by learning optimal word embeddings from visual content. This retains the open-vocabulary capabilities of the models.- Showing performance improvements from learning class names that are complementary to gains from prompt tuning techniques. Consistent experimental gains are demonstrated across 13 classification and detection datasets.- Highlighting the method's applicability for sequential adaptation, where it outperforms prompt tuning approaches. Strong open-vocabulary and long tail performance is also evidenced.  - Demonstrating the interpretability insights enabled by visualizing how class names change based on visual content. This allows identification of model biases, labelling errors, and inadequately chosen class names.In summary, the key novelty is a simple yet effective strategy to learn optimal class names directly from visual content. This improves vision-language model adaptation, retaining desirable open-vocabulary properties, while also providing interpretability. The consistent gains over strong prompt tuning baselines across diverse tasks highlight the complementary nature of learning class names to prompt context optimization.
