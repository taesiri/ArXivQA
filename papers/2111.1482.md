# [DAGSurv: Directed Acyclic Graph Based Survival Analysis Using Deep   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.1482)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can knowledge of the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure between features improve survival analysis prediction compared to methods that do not leverage this graphical structure?The key hypothesis is that incorporating the causal DAG structure into the analysis will lead to better representation of the data and improved predictive performance on survival analysis tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) framework called DAGSurv that integrates the DAG structure as part of the model. The DAG encodes assumed causal relationships between features. The CVAE component allows incorporating this graphical information into an end-to-end model for survival prediction.The authors show through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that DAGSurv outperforms survival analysis baselines like Cox PH, DeepSurv, and DeepHit that do not consider the feature DAG structure. This provides evidence supporting their hypothesis that encoding the causal graph can improve representation and prediction.In summary, the central research question is whether and how exploiting knowledge of the causal DAG structure can improve survival analysis, which the authors address through the proposed DAGSurv model. The key hypothesis is that incorporating the DAG will lead to better data representation and predictive performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Using information-theoretic source coding arguments, the authors show that utilizing the knowledge of the adjacency matrix along with the input covariates leads to more optimal encoding of the source distribution compared to assuming the covariates are statistically independent.2. Motivated by the source coding argument, the authors propose a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based novel deep learning architecture called DAGSurv to incorporate knowledge of the causal DAG for structured survival prediction. 3. The authors demonstrate the performance of DAGSurv using time-dependent concordance index as the evaluation metric on both synthetic and real-world datasets like Metabric and GBSG. The results show that incorporating the causal DAG in survival prediction improves outcomes compared to baselines like Cox PH, DeepSurv and Deephit which do not utilize the DAG structure.4. The authors provide a method to estimate the causal DAG from data when it is not readily available, using algorithms like bnlearn and DAG-GNN. This estimated DAG can then be input to DAGSurv for improved survival prediction.In summary, the key contribution is developing a way to incorporate causal DAG knowledge into survival analysis using a CVAE framework, and showing improved prediction performance compared to DAG-agnostic baselines. The information theoretic motivation and estimated DAG approach also represent important contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called DAGSurv that incorporates knowledge of the causal relationships between variables (encoded as a directed acyclic graph) into survival analysis to improve prediction accuracy compared to methods that do not utilize this causal structure.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper on DAGSurv compares to other related research in survival analysis:- The main novelty is in incorporating causal graph structure (DAG) into the survival prediction model. Most prior works like DeepSurv, DeepHit, etc do not explicitly model the relationships between covariates. - By encoding the DAG into a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), the authors are able to achieve better representation learning compared to models that assume covariates are independent. This is shown theoretically using information theory arguments and empirically on datasets.- Many existing survival analysis methods like Cox PH assume proportional hazards, but DAGSurv does not make this assumption. It is more flexible and generalizable. - DAGSurv does not require computing a concordance index constraint like DeepHit, which can be expensive for large datasets. Still it matches or outperforms DeepHit.- For real datasets where the DAG is unknown, the authors use algorithms like bnlearn or DAG-GNN to estimate a DAG from data as a preprocessing step before applying DAGSurv.- The experiments compare DAGSurv to Cox PH, DeepSurv, DeepHit on synthetic and real clinical datasets. It shows improved predictive performance using time-dependent concordance index.- Overall, modeling structure between covariates and encoding it into the model via a CVAE is a nice way to improve survival analysis. The results validate that using the causal DAG helps in representation learning and prediction accuracy.In summary, the novelty of incorporating causal structure and the gains shown make this an important contribution to the literature on Survival Analysis and representation learning. The results are compelling and technique is generalizable.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more optimal source encoders to incorporate the DAG knowledge for survival analysis. The CVAE used in DAGSurv is proposed as one possible encoder, but may not be optimal. The authors suggest exploring other encoders that can more efficiently encode the DAG structure.- Extending the analysis to handle multiple risk scenarios. The current DAGSurv framework focuses on single risk survival analysis. The authors suggest expanding it to handle competing risks.- Applying the framework for counterfactual inference. The causal DAG structure could potentially allow answering "what-if" questions by intervening on variables. The authors suggest exploring counterfactual questions enabled by the DAG encoding.- Analyzing recurring event data. The current work handles single event survival analysis. Extending to handle recurring events over time is suggested. - Incorporating explainability. The DAG encoding provides interpretability. Further pursuing explainable AI to provide insights into the model's predictions is suggested.- Validating causal relations in graphical models. The authors suggest DAGSurv could be used to validate assumed causal dynamics by testing if incorporating the DAG improves predictions.- Applying to other prediction tasks beyond survival analysis like classification and regression. The general DAG encoding methodology could be adapted for non-survival prediction problems.In summary, the main future directions focus on improving the DAG encoding, expanding to new types of survival analysis data, pursuing explainability, and applying the overall approach to other prediction tasks. The core idea of encoding causal DAG knowledge has wide applicability for improving predictive modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method called DAGSurv that incorporates causal relationships between covariates for survival analysis using deep neural networks. It argues that encoding the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure along with the input covariates leads to better representation and compression of the data distribution based on information theory. The method uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to integrate the DAG and perform structured survival prediction without relying on proportional hazards or other modeling assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets like METABRIC and GBSG show that DAGSurv outperforms Cox regression, DeepSurv, and DeepHit baselines in terms of time-dependent concordance index. The causal graph also provides interpretability. Overall, the paper demonstrates the benefits of encoding causal relationships in a DAG into deep learning models for survival analysis.
