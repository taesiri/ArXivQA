# [DAGSurv: Directed Acyclic Graph Based Survival Analysis Using Deep   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.1482)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can knowledge of the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure between features improve survival analysis prediction compared to methods that do not leverage this graphical structure?The key hypothesis is that incorporating the causal DAG structure into the analysis will lead to better representation of the data and improved predictive performance on survival analysis tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) framework called DAGSurv that integrates the DAG structure as part of the model. The DAG encodes assumed causal relationships between features. The CVAE component allows incorporating this graphical information into an end-to-end model for survival prediction.The authors show through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that DAGSurv outperforms survival analysis baselines like Cox PH, DeepSurv, and DeepHit that do not consider the feature DAG structure. This provides evidence supporting their hypothesis that encoding the causal graph can improve representation and prediction.In summary, the central research question is whether and how exploiting knowledge of the causal DAG structure can improve survival analysis, which the authors address through the proposed DAGSurv model. The key hypothesis is that incorporating the DAG will lead to better data representation and predictive performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Using information-theoretic source coding arguments, the authors show that utilizing the knowledge of the adjacency matrix along with the input covariates leads to more optimal encoding of the source distribution compared to assuming the covariates are statistically independent.2. Motivated by the source coding argument, the authors propose a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based novel deep learning architecture called DAGSurv to incorporate knowledge of the causal DAG for structured survival prediction. 3. The authors demonstrate the performance of DAGSurv using time-dependent concordance index as the evaluation metric on both synthetic and real-world datasets like Metabric and GBSG. The results show that incorporating the causal DAG in survival prediction improves outcomes compared to baselines like Cox PH, DeepSurv and Deephit which do not utilize the DAG structure.4. The authors provide a method to estimate the causal DAG from data when it is not readily available, using algorithms like bnlearn and DAG-GNN. This estimated DAG can then be input to DAGSurv for improved survival prediction.In summary, the key contribution is developing a way to incorporate causal DAG knowledge into survival analysis using a CVAE framework, and showing improved prediction performance compared to DAG-agnostic baselines. The information theoretic motivation and estimated DAG approach also represent important contributions.
