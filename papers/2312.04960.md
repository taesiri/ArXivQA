# [MIMIR: Masked Image Modeling for Mutual Information-based Adversarial   Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04960)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MIMIR, a novel defense method against adversarial attacks on vision transformers (ViTs). MIMIR utilizes masked image modeling (MIM) at pre-training stage to improve robustness. Specifically, an autoencoder is trained where the encoder is a ViT that accepts adversarial examples as inputs, and the decoder reconstructs the original clean images. By masking out 75\% of image patches, the encoder discards redundant information and learns robust features. Theoretical analysis based on information bottleneck motivates adding a mutual information penalty between adversarial inputs and latent representations, further eliminating adversarial noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet demonstrate that MIMIR significantly boosts accuracy under white-box attacks. Notably, MIMIR improves average accuracy by 4-6\% over baselines, while being much more efficient than traditional adversarial training. Additional analyses reveal MIMIR's compatibility with advanced fine-tuning methods and resistance to adaptive attacks. In summary, MIMIR establishes a new adversarial training paradigm that is both effective and efficient for building robust ViTs.
