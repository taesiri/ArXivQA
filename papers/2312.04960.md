# [MIMIR: Masked Image Modeling for Mutual Information-based Adversarial   Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04960)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MIMIR, a novel defense method against adversarial attacks on vision transformers (ViTs). MIMIR utilizes masked image modeling (MIM) at pre-training stage to improve robustness. Specifically, an autoencoder is trained where the encoder is a ViT that accepts adversarial examples as inputs, and the decoder reconstructs the original clean images. By masking out 75\% of image patches, the encoder discards redundant information and learns robust features. Theoretical analysis based on information bottleneck motivates adding a mutual information penalty between adversarial inputs and latent representations, further eliminating adversarial noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet demonstrate that MIMIR significantly boosts accuracy under white-box attacks. Notably, MIMIR improves average accuracy by 4-6\% over baselines, while being much more efficient than traditional adversarial training. Additional analyses reveal MIMIR's compatibility with advanced fine-tuning methods and resistance to adaptive attacks. In summary, MIMIR establishes a new adversarial training paradigm that is both effective and efficient for building robust ViTs.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViTs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks compared to CNNs. Adversarial training is effective to improve robustness but it is computationally expensive.  
- Recent works explore new adversarial training methodologies for ViTs considering their differences from CNNs, such as better training strategies or preventing attention from focusing on adversarial perturbations. However, they still follow the traditional supervised adversarial training framework.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel defense method called MIMIR, which utilizes Masked Image Modeling (MIM) at pre-training stage.  
- An autoencoder is created that takes adversarial examples as input but reconstructs clean examples. This forces the model to eliminate adversarial perturbation information and retain natural image information.
- Mutual information (MI) between adversarial input and latent representation is added as a penalty in the loss to further eliminate adversarial information.

Key Contributions:
- A new adversarial training paradigm using MIM at pre-training stage which discards 75% image patches making it efficient.
- Theoretical analysis showing MI between adversarial input and latent representation decreases with accuracy on adversarial examples.
- Experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet datasets show MIMIR significantly improves robustness over state-of-the-art methods.
- Analysis of two new adaptive attacks designed specifically against MIMIR defense showing it remains robust.
- Demonstration that strong data augmentations can improve robustness given longer training schedules.

Overall, the key novelty is in using MIM at pre-training stage and theoretically showing how it eliminates adversarial information, leading to a new adversarial training paradigm. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate clear improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches.
