# [SocialPET: Socially Informed Pattern Exploiting Training for Few-Shot   Stance Detection in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05216)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of stance detection with limited labeled data. Stance detection involves determining whether a text expresses a favorable or opposing viewpoint towards a target entity. Obtaining sufficient labeled training data for new targets is challenging and expensive. This motivates developing few-shot stance detection methods that can work effectively with very limited labeled data.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel few-shot stance detection model called SocialPET that incorporates social context into the Pattern Exploiting Training (PET) method. PET reformulates text classification as filling in the blanks of cloze-style phrases using a language model. SocialPET enhances this by appending predicted user community information to the PET pattern, assuming homophily in social networks. 

The social adapter component first directly infers the community from the label for labeled training instances. For unlabeled test instances, it computes aggregated user, friend, and like networks for supporter and opposer groups from the few training shots. It then assigns the unlabeled user to the community with higher network overlap. This community information gets appended to the PET pattern.

Contributions:
- Proposes a novel few-shot stance detection model SocialPET that incorporates social context into PET, representing the first extension of PET with a social adapter.

- Introduces an innovative way of tackling few-shot stance detection by exploiting social homophily assumptions to predict user communities.

- Evaluates SocialPET on two stance detection datasets across six targets in 100-400 shot settings, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines.

- Provides detailed analysis of results by class, showing that social context particularly helps in identifying Against instances. Also analyzes impact of network overlap between supporter and opposer groups.

In summary, the paper makes significant research contributions in few-shot stance detection by developing and evaluating SocialPET, a PET-based model enhanced with social context. Analysis provides useful insights into the utility of leveraging social networks.
