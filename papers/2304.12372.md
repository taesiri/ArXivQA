# [Beyond the Pixel: a Photometrically Calibrated HDR Dataset for Luminance   and Color Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12372)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the Laval Photometric Indoor HDR Dataset, which is the first large-scale photometrically calibrated dataset of high dynamic range 360° panoramas for indoor scenes. 

2. The key idea is to take an existing uncalibrated HDR dataset and carefully calibrate it using simultaneous measurements with a professional photometric device (chroma meter) to determine per-channel correction factors. This results in a rich representation of indoor scenes with accurate luminance and color values.

3. Proposing and analyzing three novel computer vision tasks enabled by the dataset: 

- Per-pixel luminance prediction to recover the absolute luminance value at each pixel from a single input image

- Per-pixel color prediction to estimate the correlated color temperature (CCT) at each pixel

- Planar illuminance prediction to predict the total light incident on a plane, which could have applications like image relighting 

4. Studying the impact of various degradations to the input image (noise, tone-mapping, etc.) on the performance of these tasks.

5. Capturing a smaller photometric dataset using a commercial 360° camera to analyze generalization across cameras. 

So in summary, the main research contributions are introducing a novel photometrically calibrated HDR dataset, proposing new physically-based vision tasks enabled by it, and analyzing the challenges and requirements for performing accurate light estimation from images. The overall goal is to bridge the gap between predicted pixel values and real-world luminance/color measurements.
