# [Online Concurrent Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10460)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of online multi-robot coverage path planning (CPP) in unknown environments. Specifically, it focuses on centralized horizon-based algorithms like GAMRCPP, where the path planning and path execution happen in an interleaved manner within horizons. This leads to wastage of both robotic resources (robots waiting during planning phase) and computation resources (no planning happening during execution phase). 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a centralized but non-horizon-based concurrent CPP algorithm called ConCPP. In ConCPP, the path replanning happens on-demand for robots that have reached their goals, while the other robots continue executing their existing paths. This allows overlapping of path planning and execution phases, enabling efficient utilization of available resources.  

The key ideas in ConCPP are:
- Maintaining a global discrete clock to synchronize path execution across robots
- Timestamping newly planned paths so robots start execution from that specific time
- Dynamically setting the number of participants needed to start next replanning round
- Parallelly sending paths to robots using a separate thread during replanning round

Main Contributions:
- A concurrent framework for centralized multi-robot CPP that enables parallel path planning and execution
- Formal proof of completeness in coverage for unknown environments
- Empirical evaluation in 8 large benchmark environments with up to 512 robots showing superior performance over state-of-the-art horizon-based technique
- Real-world validation through ROS+Gazebo simulations and real experiments with quadcopters and ground robots

The results demonstrate up to 1.6x speedup over horizon-based algorithm in coverage time. ConCPP framework is highly generalizable for various robotic systems in unknown environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a centralized online multi-robot coverage path planning algorithm that enables concurrent path planning and path execution, achieving faster complete coverage of unknown environments compared to horizon-based approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a centralized online multi-robot coverage path planning algorithm that enables concurrent path planning and path execution. Specifically:

- It is a non-horizon-based algorithm, unlike previous centralized algorithms that operate in horizons where path planning and path following interleave. This concurrent operation allows for better utilization of both computational and robotic resources.

- It plans paths on-demand for robots that have reached their previously assigned goals, while other robots continue executing their existing paths. This avoids wasting robotic resources waiting for new plans. 

- It timestamps the new paths with a global clock, allowing execution to happen in sync. Planning can happen anytime there is a robot needing a new plan.

- Formally proves the algorithm ensures complete coverage of unknown workspaces.

- Evaluates the algorithm in large benchmark environments and compares to a state-of-the-art horizon-based algorithm, demonstrating superior performance in terms of faster completion of coverage, with up to 1.6x speedup when using up to 512 robots.

- Validates the approach through Gazebo simulations and real-world experiments with quadcopters and ground robots.

In summary, the key contribution is the concurrent planning and execution in a centralized framework that improves performance over previous horizon-based approaches.
