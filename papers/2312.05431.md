# [Efficient Quantization Strategies for Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are powerful generative models that can generate high-quality images by capturing complex patterns and multimodality. However, their large size makes deployment on edge devices challenging. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can compress models, but faces difficulties when applied to LDMs due to their temporal dynamics and structural complexity which can magnify quantization errors. More efficient LDM quantization strategies are needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an efficient quantization strategy for LDMs by analyzing relative quantization noise using the Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio (SQNR) metric. This allows identifying sensitive blocks and modules in the LDM architecture. The strategy has global and local components:

Global: A hybrid quantization is proposed where higher precision quantization is initiated on identified sensitive blocks to mitigate accumulated noise. This is done by progressively quantizing each block and tracking output SQNR over time.

Local: Sensitive modules are identified via relative SQNR scores. Two tailored solutions are proposed - a smoothing mechanism (SmoothQuant) to alleviate outlier activations for some modules, and single-step calibration to leverage robustness of modules to diffusion noise.

Main Contributions:

- First strategy to provide efficient quantization solutions for LDMs at global and local levels based on relative quantization noise analysis
- Adapt SQNR as efficient metric to track accumulated and relative noise 
- Global hybrid quantization strategy with higher precision for sensitive blocks
- Local solutions of SmoothQuant for outlier activations and single-step calibration

The strategy is experimentally shown to enable efficient LDM quantization outperforming baseline min-max quantization, highlighting the usefulness of global and local analysis.
