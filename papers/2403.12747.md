# [N-Modal Contrastive Losses with Applications to Social Media Data in   Trimodal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Social media posts are increasingly multi-modal, containing text, images, and videos. However, existing models like CLIP are limited to only two modalities (text and images). 
- There is a need for models that can understand the interplay between multiple modalities like text, images, videos (and even audio) that are commonly present together in social media posts. This is especially useful for tasks like open source intelligence (OSINT).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an extension of contrastive learning approaches like CLIP to N modalities, termed as N-modal contrastive loss. 
- It formally defines how existing losses like triplet loss and contrastive loss can be extended to N dimensions.
- It demonstrates this via trimodal (text, image, video) and quadmodal (text, image, video, audio) contrastive models trained on social media data.

Main Contributions:

1. Formal extension of two contrastive losses (triplet and CLIP) to 3+ modalities

2. New social media dataset containing text and videos from Telegram (can create trimodal dataset with video frames as images)

3. Trained publicly available trimodal CLIP models (triCLIP) benchmarked on a retrieval task

4. Demonstrated applications of triCLIP via binary stance classification and multi-class account classification tasks  

5. First proof-of-concept quadmodal contrastive model (quadCLIP) trained on text, images, videos and audio

The models achieve high retrieval accuracy demonstrating their ability to relate multiple modalities. The applications also showcase the usefulness of having a single model that can create embeddings for multiple data types to perform downstream classification tasks relevant for OSINT.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an extension of contrastive loss to support learning joint representations across any number of modalities, demonstrates this for trimodal and quadmodal models on social media data, and shows applications for stance classification and account provenance classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A formal extension of two contrastive losses (triplet loss and contrastive loss) to 3 or more modalities. This allows models to learn representations across multiple modalities like text, images, video, and audio.

2) Introduction of new social media datasets containing posts with videos and text, as well as a method to synthesize trimodal examples from this by treating video frames as images.

3) Publicly available pre-trained trimodal and quadmodal contrastive models.

4) Demonstrations of the usefulness of the trimodal models for two applications: stance classification and account provenance classification on social media posts.

5) A proof-of-concept quadmodal contrastive model trained on tuples of text, images, video and audio. This is the first model of its kind and provides a new baseline for future quadmodal research.

In summary, the main contribution is the extension of contrastive losses to handle more modalities, new multi-modal social media datasets, and applications showing the usefulness of trimodal and quadmodal models for social media understanding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an N-modal contrastive loss for projecting multiple modalities into a shared latent space. How is this loss function formulated mathematically? What are the key components and parameters? 

2. The paper demonstrates the N-modal contrastive loss on trimodal (image, text, video) and quadmodal (image, text, video, audio) spaces. What encoders are used for each modality and why were they chosen? How are the output embeddings combined?

3. A new trimodal dataset collected from Telegram is introduced. What is the composition of this dataset (number of posts, modalities per post, etc.)? How was it collected and what accounts were targeted? 

4. The paper compares trimodal triplet (triTRIP) and contrastive (triCLIP) losses. What are the key differences between these losses and their effects on training time and retrieval accuracy? Why does triCLIP perform better?

5. Retrieval accuracy is evaluated by giving the model a single modality query and asking it to return the original post. Why is the query not compared to artifacts of the same modality during evaluation? What does this demonstrate about the model?

6. How does the trimodal model compare to prior social media CLIP models on retrieval accuracy when trained on the same amount of data? What explains the improved performance of the trimodal model?

7. Two classification tasks are demonstrated using embeddings from the trimodal model - stance classification and account provenance. For both tasks, how do the different classification methods compare in their performance? 

8. The quadmodal CLIP model shows poorer retrieval accuracy compared to the trimodal model. What are some possible explanations for this drop in performance? How can the quadmodal model be improved?

9. What other applications could this N-modal contrastive learning approach be useful for in contexts beyond social media? What other modalities could be incorporated?

10. What are some promising areas for future work building on this method? What suggestions do the authors provide for improving performance of the models?
