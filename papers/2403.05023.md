# [Towards Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Debiasing via Bias Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Debiasing via Bias Purification":

Problem:
- Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human intentions by integrating clues from multiple modalities like text, audio, and visual. 
- However, current MSA models suffer from two types of biases:
  1) Utterance-level label bias caused by imbalanced training label distribution (\eg 95\% positive, 5\% negative)
  2) Word-level context bias caused by spurious correlations between sentiment-irrelevant words and sentiment labels (\eg "good" more common in positive samples)
- These biases cause models to rely on shortcuts and correlations instead of actual semantics, limiting performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Multimodal Counterfactual Inference Sentiment (MCIS) framework to mitigate the two biases.
- First design a causal graph to diagnose relationships among variables and identify the biases as confounders.
- During inference, given a factual input, MCIS generates two counterfactual inputs:
  1) No-treatment input to purify label bias 
  2) Input with only context words to purify context bias
- Compare factual and counterfactual outcomes to eliminate effect of biases and make unbiased predictions.

Main Contributions:  
- First to identify and disentangle label and context biases in MSA from a causal perspective.
- General framework suitable for different MSA models.
- Experiments show consistent and significant gains over state-of-the-art methods by removing biases at inference time without complex network changes.

In summary, the paper provides a novel causality-based perspective to alleviate multimodal biases and achieve more accurate sentiment analysis. The proposed MCIS framework is model-agnostic, lightweight and demonstrates strong empirical results.
