# [MixMix: All You Need for Data-Free Compression Are Feature and Data   Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09899)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we generate high-fidelity and generalizable training data for data-free model compression without access to real user data?The key points related to this question seem to be:- Existing methods for data-free model compression like model inversion suffer from two main problems:    1) The synthesized data is biased and does not generalize well to compressing different model architectures.    2) The inversion process results in inexact synthesis due to non-invertibility of neural networks.- To address these issues, the authors propose two techniques:    1) Feature Mixing: Utilizing multiple pretrained models to create a more universal feature space for generalized inversion.    2) Data Mixing: Mixing synthesized images and labels to generate more precise training data. - The main hypothesis appears to be that by using Feature Mixing and Data Mixing, they can generate synthesized training data that:    - Has higher fidelity and generalizability for compressing diverse model architectures    - Allows more exact inversion through label mixing    - Outperforms existing data-free compression techniquesThe experiments and results seem focused on validating this hypothesis by testing their proposed MixMix technique on various compression tasks and models. The improvements over baseline methods help demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in addressing the core research problem.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new image synthesis algorithm called MixMix that utilizes feature mixing from multiple pre-trained models and data mixing of synthesized images to generate more generalized and invertible training data for data-free model compression tasks like quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief summary and comparison of the key points in this paper to other related research:- The paper proposes MixMix, a data synthesis method for data-free model compression. It identifies two issues with existing model inversion methods for data synthesis: lack of generalizability across models and inexact inversion. - To improve generalizability, MixMix uses Feature Mixing to incorporate features from multiple pretrained models. This is a novel approach compared to prior works like ZeroQ, Knowledge Within, and DeepInversion which synthesize data from a single model. Theoretical analysis shows Feature Mixing improves universality of the generated data distribution.- To enable more exact inversion, MixMix uses Data Mixing which mixes pixel values and labels of synthesized images. This narrows the space of possible solutions during inversion. Other works have not explicitly addressed the inexact inversion issue.- Experiments demonstrate MixMix outperforms prior arts across various compression tasks like pruning, quantization, and distillation. For example, it achieves 20% higher accuracy for pruning compared to DeepInversion. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.- Overall, MixMix makes significant advances over prior model inversion methods by improving generalizability through feature mixing, and enabling more exact inversion via data mixing. The gains on compression benchmarks demonstrate these are highly impactful techniques for data-free model compression.In summary, MixMix pushes forward the state-of-the-art in data synthesis for model compression by addressing key limitations of prior arts through two simple but effective strategies. The strong experimental results validate its effectiveness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Investigating more advanced generative models like GANs for data-free compression instead of just image inversion. The authors mention that training large-scale GANs from scratch requires significant effort, so improving and adapting existing GAN methods could be an interesting direction.- Exploring different criteria and metrics beyond just matching batch norm statistics for inverting/synthesizing data. The authors propose feature mixing and data mixing techniques, but developing new metrics tailored for compression could further improve inversion quality.- Applying MixMix techniques to other compression methods beyond quantization, pruning and distillation covered in the paper. For example, the authors suggest it could be relevant for automating architecture search and neural architecture compression which also rely heavily on data.- Testing MixMix on larger and more complex datasets beyond CIFAR and ImageNet. The authors demonstrate promising results, but expanding to larger datasets could reveal new challenges.- Further theoretical analysis and proofs related to the universality and exact inversion properties discussed. More formal connections could be made with the statistical learning theory.- Hyperparameter tuning and architecture search for the selection of MixMix model ensemble. The authors use a simple uniform sampling strategy, but learned or optimized model selection could help.- Investigating the trainability and generalization of the generated synthetic datasets themselves. The authors mainly use them for compression, but analyzing their standalone quality is also relevant.In summary, the authors propose an interesting data synthesis method and there are many promising research avenues to further improve invertibility, generalizability and applicability of data-free compression techniques. Analyzing both theoretical and empirical aspects are important future directions.
