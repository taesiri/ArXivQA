# [Recursive Video Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11106)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can we improve video-based lane detection by exploiting inter-frame correlation more effectively? Specifically, the authors propose a novel algorithm called recursive video lane detector (RVLD) to address this question. The key ideas are:- Design an intra-frame lane detector (ILD) to localize lanes in individual video frames. - Develop a predictive lane detector (PLD) that uses information from the previous frame to improve detection in the current frame. This is done by estimating the motion between frames, warping previous outputs, and refining the feature map. - Recursively pass the state information from the current frame to the next frame in a first-order Markov chain manner.- Evaluate the proposed RVLD on two video lane detection datasets and show improved performance over existing methods, especially in terms of temporal stability of detections.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that exploiting inter-frame correlation more effectively, through techniques like motion-based feature warping and recursive state propagation, can significantly improve the accuracy and stability of video-based lane detection. The RVLD algorithm is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a novel video lane detection algorithm called recursive video lane detector (RVLD). RVLD improves lane detection in the current frame by using information from only the previous frame in a recursive manner.- It consists of two components: an intra-frame lane detector (ILD) to detect lanes in individual frames, and a predictive lane detector (PLD) to refine lane detection in the current frame using motion estimation and feature warping from the previous frame.- It achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video lane detection datasets: VIL-100 and a modified version of OpenLane called OpenLane-V. On both datasets, RVLD outperforms previous image-based and video-based lane detectors.- It introduces two new evaluation metrics for video lane detection - flickering rate and missing rate - to assess the temporal stability of detection. RVLD achieves the lowest flickering and missing rates compared to prior arts.- It modifies the OpenLane dataset to make it suitable for video lane detection by filling in missing annotations. The modified dataset called OpenLane-V contains about 90K images from 590 videos.In summary, the key contribution is a novel recursive video lane detection algorithm that propagates information between frames and achieves improved performance and temporal stability compared to prior image-based and video-based methods. The modification of OpenLane to create a larger benchmark for video lane detection is also an important contribution.
