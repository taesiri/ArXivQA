# [Adaptive Step Duration for Precise Foot Placement: Achieving Robust   Bipedal Locomotion on Terrains with Restricted Footholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust bipedal walking for humanoid robots across terrains with severely restricted footholds, such as random stepping stones. Traditional one-step preview foot placement planning methods struggle in such scenarios as they cannot guarantee viability and stability over multiple future steps with tight constraints. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel multi-step preview foot placement planning algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC) of the divergent component of motion (DCM) dynamics. The DCM represents the unstable part of the center of mass (CoM) dynamics. The algorithm plans optimal footsteps over multiple future steps while ensuring bounded DCM states that lead to stability. It does this by adaptively changing the step length and duration within predefined bounds.

Key Contributions:

1. Derives discrete dynamics of the DCM initial state over multiple steps and shows it can be bounded with appropriate foot placement planning.

2. Formulates an MPC problem with the DCM discrete dynamics that optimizes foot placements over a preview horizon of N steps. This yields a nonlinear program with bilinear constraints.

3. Demonstrates significantly improved robustness against disturbances and ability to walk over diverse stepping stone configurations in simulation compared to a baseline single-step preview method. The algorithm can navigate the robot across complex sequences of stepping stones by ensuring viability over multiple steps.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel multi-step foot placement planning algorithm for bipedal walking that can adaptively change step lengths and durations. By optimizing foot placements to bound the DCM over a preview horizon, it achieves highly robust walking over severely foothold-constrained terrain. The algorithm is validated in simulation on various stepping stone profiles.
