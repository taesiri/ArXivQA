# [HiCAST: Highly Customized Arbitrary Style Transfer with Adapter Enhanced   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing arbitrary style transfer (AST) methods focus on balancing style and content but lack the ability to flexibly customize stylization results based on explicit semantic clues from multiple levels (e.g. textures, structures). This limits their practical application.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a highly controllable arbitrary style transfer (HiCAST) approach that leverages both high-level semantic clues (e.g. depth, segmentation) and low-level style information to precisely control stylization. 

The key ideas are:

1) A diffusion model based AST pipeline with content and style images as conditional inputs. This is trained with a content loss, style loss and adversarial loss to preserve content while matching style statistics.

2) A Style Adapter module that aligns external semantic clues (as control maps) with internal knowledge in the diffusion model. This allows explicit control over stylization by tuning adapter weights.  

3) Extension to video AST using temporal layers and a novel Harmonious Consistency loss. This loss ensures stylization is maintained while improving temporal consistency across frames.

Main Contributions:

- First work to leverage multi-level semantic clues to precisely customize AST results in diffusion models

- Style Adapter module for explicit control over stylization by learning alignment between external clues and internal diffusion model knowledge  

- First diffusion model based approach for video AST with a Harmonious Consistency loss to balance stylization and temporal consistency

- Qualitative and quantitative experiments showing state-of-the-art performance over other AST techniques on both images and videos

In summary, the key novelty is the ability to precisely control arbitrary style transfer results based on diverse semantic clues through the proposed style adapter module and losses. Both image and video AST produce superior results compared to previous arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a highly controllable arbitrary style transfer method called HiCAST, which can explicitly leverage multi-level style information to customize image and video stylization results using diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a highly controllable arbitrary style transfer (HiCAST) model that can explicitly leverage multi-level style information to customize the stylization results. This is done through a novel Style Adapter module.

2) It builds the first diffusion-based architecture for video arbitrary style transfer. A new learning objective called Harmonious Consistency loss is presented to significantly improve cross-frame temporal consistency while preserving stylization strength. 

3) Extensive experiments show superior performance of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art on both image and video style transfer. Qualitative and quantitative results as well as user studies demonstrate the ability to generate more visually pleasing stylization results.

In summary, the key innovation is the Style Adapter module that allows explicit control over stylization using multi-level style signals, and the application of this technique to both image and video style transfer through specially designed diffusion-based architectures.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Arbitrary Style Transfer (AST): The goal of transferring the artistic style from a reference image to a content image or video. 

- Diffusion Models (DMs): Generative models that gradually denoise latent representations over time through Markov chains.

- Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs): A variant of DMs that operates in a compact latent space from a VAE encoder rather than directly in the pixel space.

- Style Adapter Module: A module proposed in this paper to align and inject multi-level style information into the LDM for more flexible control.

- Harmonious Consistency Loss: A novel loss function proposed for the video AST model to improve temporal consistency while preserving stylization strength.  

- Explicit Control: The ability to customize the stylization by leveraging different semantic signals like edges, depth maps, or segmentation masks through the style adapter module.

- Image and Video AST: The paper proposes methods for AST on both images and videos, with a focus on temporal consistency for videos.

In summary, the key ideas are using LDMs for AST in a more controllable way, introducing style adapters for explicit control, and extending the approach to consistent video stylization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new module called "Style Adapter". What is the motivation behind this module and how does it allow for more flexible control over stylization? 

2. The training strategy employs a three-stage approach. Can you explain the purpose of each stage and why a staged approach was chosen?

3. The harmonious consistency loss for video AST contains both global and local components. What is the thinking behind this composite loss function? How do the two components complement each other?

4. How does the proposed video AST method improve temporal consistency compared to prior single-frame based approaches? What specific strategies or architectural choices contribute to this improvement?

5. What modifications were made to the baseline LDM architecture to adapt it for the AST task in this work? Why are these changes necessary?

6. The method leverages both content loss and style loss during training. What is the effect of each loss and how do they interact to improve the final stylization output?  

7. What are the advantages of building an AST method on top of a diffusion model rather than other generative models like GANs? What unique capabilities do diffusion models have?

8. How does the proposed method move beyond simply controlling the coarse, overall stylization strength? What additional control dimensions does it enable?

9. Why is alignment between external semantic signals and internal representations in the diffusion model important? How does the Style Adapter module achieve this?

10. What architectures or techniques does this method build upon? How does it go beyond previous diffusion-based AST works to enable more control and customization?
