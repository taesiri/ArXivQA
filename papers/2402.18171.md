# [Digging Into Normal Incorporated Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Stereo matching is a fundamental computer vision task with many applications like robotics, autonomous driving, AR/VR, etc. Despite recent progress with learning-based methods, estimating accurate disparity in challenging areas like low-texture, occluded and border regions remains difficult. These regions lack geometric consistency and need guidance about where to propagate information from.

Solution:
The paper proposes a normal incorporated joint learning framework called NINet to leverage estimated surface normals to provide geometric guidance. It has two main components:

1. Non-local Disparity Propagation (NDP) Module: Uses predicted normals and warped error to compute non-local affinities and offsets. This allows dynamically sampling points with similar plane orientations during propagation. Helps with border and occluded regions.

2. Affinity-Aware Residual Learning (ARL) Module: Uses an error-based attention map to concentrate on mismatched areas. Further uses local affinities from normals to re-weight features for residual regression. Helps with low-texture areas.

Overall the explicit use of geometrical guidance from normals helps refine challenging areas in a dedicated manner.

Contributions:

- Propose a joint normal and stereo matching network with geometric guidance from normals
- Introduce two components NDP and ARL that use normals differently to handle specific challenging cases 
- Achieve state-of-the-art results on SceneFlow, KITTI-15 and Middlebury datasets
- Rank 1st on KITTI-15 benchmark for foreground disparities
- Demonstrate great generalization ability to new datasets

In summary, the paper leverages surface normals in a very effective way via propagation and affinity-based feature re-weighting to achieve accurate and consistent disparity maps. The performance and generalization ability highlights the benefits of incorporating geometrical guidance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a normal incorporated joint learning framework with two modules - non-local disparity propagation and affinity-aware residual learning - to leverage surface normal information for improving stereo matching performance, especially in challenging low-texture, occluded, and border regions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a normal incorporated joint learning framework called NINet to explicitly leverage plane information from surface normal estimation to provide intuitive geometric guidance for disparity estimation in stereo matching. 

2. It proposes two specific modules: 

(a) A non-local disparity propagation (NDP) module that performs spatial propagation at the disparity level to improve results in bordered and occluded regions.

(b) An affinity-aware residual learning (ARL) module that uses a local affinity matrix based on the normal map to guide where to learn disparity residuals from, improving results in low-texture regions.

3. It proposes a method to generate dense pseudo ground truth normal maps on KITTI 2015 to enable training the model on real-world driving datasets with sparse disparity labels.

4. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art results on Scene Flow, KITTI 2015, and Middlebury datasets. The method ranks 1st on KITTI 2015 for foreground disparities among published works.

In summary, the key contribution is the joint learning framework and the two proposed modules that effectively incorporate surface normal information to improve stereo matching performance, especially in challenging areas like borders, occlusions, and low-texture regions.
