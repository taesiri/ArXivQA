# [RealNet: A Feature Selection Network with Realistic Synthetic Anomaly   for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing anomaly detection methods face challenges in synthesizing realistic and diverse anomaly images for self-supervised training. They rely on data augmentation or external datasets, leading to distribution discrepancy between synthetic and real anomalies. In addition, effectively leveraging large-scale pre-trained models remains an open issue due to feature redundancy and reconstruction costs. 

Proposed Solution (RealNet):
The paper proposes RealNet, a feature reconstruction network with three key innovations - 

1. Strength-controllable Diffusion Anomaly Synthesis (SDAS): A diffusion process-based method to generate diverse, near-natural distribution anomaly images using only normal images. It introduces perturbation terms during sampling to control anomaly strength.

2. Anomaly-aware Feature Selection (AFS): Selects representative and discriminative pre-trained feature subsets to reduce redundancy and bias. It adaptively selects optimal features across categories for anomaly detection.  

3. Reconstruction Residual Selection (RRS): Discards reconstruction residuals lacking anomalous information to reduce missed detections and improve localization recall. It selects residuals containing maximal anomalous cues.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes SDAS for flexible and realistic anomaly synthesis aligned to natural data distributions using only normal images.

- Introduces AFS and RRS to effectively exploit large-scale pre-trained models for anomaly detection while controlling computational costs.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets - MVTec-AD, MPDD, BTAD and VisA, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse anomaly detection tasks.

- Provides the Synthetic Industrial Anomaly Dataset (SIA) comprising 360,000 anomalous images across 36 categories to facilitate future anomaly synthesis research.

In summary, RealNet advances self-supervised anomaly detection through innovative anomaly synthesis, efficient feature selection and optimized reconstruction, delivering superior performance and flexibility.
