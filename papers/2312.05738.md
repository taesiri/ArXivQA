# [FedReverse: Multiparty Reversible Deep Neural Network Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "FedReverse: Multiparty Reversible Deep Neural Network Watermarking":

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being widely adopted in commercial applications. However, training complex DNN models requires substantial resources, raising concerns about unauthorized usage and lack of attribution to model creators.  
- DNN watermarking has emerged as a technique to protect model intellectual property. But existing methods have limitations:
  - Watermarks are typically embedded during training, which can degrade model performance.
  - They don't allow multiple parties to assert copyright over a collaboratively trained model. 
  - Embedded watermarks are usually irreversible, lacking flexibility in watermark management.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FedReverse, a novel multiparty reversible DNN watermarking scheme.
- Key Features:
  - Enables watermark embedding after model training by multiple parties, ensuring individual copyright claims without impacting training.
  - Completely reversible - watermarks can be removed unanimously while restoring original model weights.
  - Addresses potential watermark conflicts among clients through orthogonal key generation.
  - Robust against attacks trying to remove watermarks or deduce the secret key.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the multiparty reversible DNN watermarking problem.
- Introduces the FedReverse scheme enabling collaborative, reversible watermark embedding post model training.
- Proposes an orthogonal key generation method to assign unique keys to multiple clients for watermarking.
- Theoretically analyzes properties like distortion, robustness against interference, perfect covering, resistance to known original attacks. 
- Empirically evaluates FedReverse by applying it to MLP and CNN models trained on MNIST, demonstrating its reversibility, robustness, minimal impact on accuracy with varying parameters.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in protecting model intellectual property rights in federated learning through a reversible and multiparty watermarking approach with rigorous analysis and evaluation.
