# [FedReverse: Multiparty Reversible Deep Neural Network Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "FedReverse: Multiparty Reversible Deep Neural Network Watermarking":

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being widely adopted in commercial applications. However, training complex DNN models requires substantial resources, raising concerns about unauthorized usage and lack of attribution to model creators.  
- DNN watermarking has emerged as a technique to protect model intellectual property. But existing methods have limitations:
  - Watermarks are typically embedded during training, which can degrade model performance.
  - They don't allow multiple parties to assert copyright over a collaboratively trained model. 
  - Embedded watermarks are usually irreversible, lacking flexibility in watermark management.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FedReverse, a novel multiparty reversible DNN watermarking scheme.
- Key Features:
  - Enables watermark embedding after model training by multiple parties, ensuring individual copyright claims without impacting training.
  - Completely reversible - watermarks can be removed unanimously while restoring original model weights.
  - Addresses potential watermark conflicts among clients through orthogonal key generation.
  - Robust against attacks trying to remove watermarks or deduce the secret key.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the multiparty reversible DNN watermarking problem.
- Introduces the FedReverse scheme enabling collaborative, reversible watermark embedding post model training.
- Proposes an orthogonal key generation method to assign unique keys to multiple clients for watermarking.
- Theoretically analyzes properties like distortion, robustness against interference, perfect covering, resistance to known original attacks. 
- Empirically evaluates FedReverse by applying it to MLP and CNN models trained on MNIST, demonstrating its reversibility, robustness, minimal impact on accuracy with varying parameters.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in protecting model intellectual property rights in federated learning through a reversible and multiparty watermarking approach with rigorous analysis and evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

FedReverse is a novel multiparty reversible watermarking approach that enables collaborative watermark embedding from multiple parties after model training to ensure individual copyright claims while allowing complete removal of watermarks with unanimous client consent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing FedReverse, a novel multiparty reversible watermarking scheme for deep neural networks. Key points about FedReverse include:

- It enables embedding watermarks from multiple clients into a trained DNN model after training. This allows individual copyright claims while minimizing impact on model accuracy.

- It is reversible - watermarks can be completely removed from the model if all clients provide consent and keys. This ensures fidelity and flexibility in watermark management.  

- It uses an orthogonal key generation method to assign unique keys to each client aligned with vectors in a random matrix. This mitigates potential watermark conflicts among clients.  

- It demonstrates features like perfect covering (leakage resilience), robustness against interference attacks, and resistance to known original attacks.

- Comprehensive experiments on MLP and CNN models trained on MNIST validate FedReverse's reversibility, minimal accuracy impact, and robustness across varying embedding parameters and client scenarios.

In summary, the key contribution is a multiparty reversible watermarking framework that protects intellectual property rights in collaborative deep learning while preserving utility. The reversibility, conflict mitigation, and security properties make it uniquely suited for this application.
