# [Daisy-TTS: Simulating Wider Spectrum of Emotions via Prosody Embedding   Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14523)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Expressing emotions through speech varies in intensity, mixtures, and other complex characteristics. This poses challenges in designing emotional text-to-speech (TTS) systems to simulate the full spectrum of human emotional expression.

- Most emotional TTS systems rely on basic emotion models like discrete categories or dimensional affect variables. These have limitations in covering the intricacies of emotional expression.  

- The structural model of emotions characterizes emotions as derivatives of few primary emotions mixed in varying intensities. This allows wider representation of emotion characteristics.

Solution:
- The paper proposes Daisy-TTS, an emotional TTS grounded in the structural model of emotions. 

- It incorporates a prosody encoder to learn an emotionally-separable latent prosody embedding space. This embedding space acts as a proxy for capturing emotional styles.

- Through decomposing and manipulating the prosody embeddings, Daisy-TTS can simulate:
   1) Primary emotions 
   2) Secondary emotions (mixtures of primaries)
   3) Varying intensity levels by scaling the embeddings
   4) Opposite emotions by negating the embeddings

Main Contributions:
- Novel TTS design to model a wider spectrum of emotional expression grounded in psychological theory of emotion structure.  

- Learning latent prosody embeddings to represent emotional styles, allowing both high quality synthesis and fine-grained control of emotion simulation.

- Framework to simulate not just categorical emotions but also complex characteristics like mixtures, intensities and negations of emotions. 

- Evaluations demonstrating Daisy-TTSâ€™ ability to simulate multi-faceted emotions with higher quality over baseline TTS models.
