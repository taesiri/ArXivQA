# [Symplectic Autoencoders for Model Reduction of Hamiltonian Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10004)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Many physical systems are described by Hamiltonian systems, which have an inherent symplectic structure that is important to preserve for stability and accuracy when doing simulations.  
- Existing model reduction techniques like POD either do not preserve this structure, or are limited to linear mappings between spaces. Autoencoders can learn non-linear mappings but also do not preserve symplectic structure.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new neural network architecture composed of:
  - SympNets modules that can approximate arbitrary symplectic mappings
  - PSD-like matrices in between, forming a manifold, that reduce/increase dimension in a structure-preserving way
- Requires optimizing on manifolds, using techniques from differential geometry
- Generalizes optimization algorithms like Adam to matrix Lie groups and homogeneous spaces

Main Contributions:
- First architecture that can learn non-linear mappings between spaces of different dimensions while preserving the symplectic structure
- Outperforms Proper Symplectic Decomposition (PSD), the existing linear technique, on a wave equation test problem
- Provides mathematical framework and optimization algorithms needed to train these networks on manifolds
- Could be useful for model reduction of complex physical systems, while maintaining stability and accuracy from preserving Hamiltonian structure

The key innovation is composing existing building blocks in a new way to create a symplectic and non-linear dimension-changing mapping, enabled by advances in manifold optimization. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over linear approaches for a model reduction task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel neural network architecture composed of SympNets and proper symplectic decomposition matrices that can approximate general symplectic mappings between spaces of different dimensions while preserving the differential geometric structure, and demonstrates its advantages over existing methods on the example of model reduction for the discretized linear wave equation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new neural network architecture that can map between spaces of different dimensions while preserving symplecticity. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a novel architecture by composing symplectic neural networks (SympNets) with proper symplectic decomposition (PSD) matrices. This allows constructing non-linear mappings that change the dimension of the system while preserving the symplectic structure.

- Previous methods like PSD were limited to linear transformations that preserve symplecticity. Standard autoencoders using neural networks can learn non-linear mappings but do not preserve symplecticity. The proposed architecture combines the advantages of both.

- Training the network requires techniques from differential geometry and manifold optimization due to the symplecticity constraints. The paper discusses the mathematical foundations and optimization methods needed.

- Experiments on a discretized PDE show that the proposed architecture outperforms PSD in terms of accuracy. This demonstrates the benefits of using non-linear mappings while preserving structure compared to linear structure-preserving methods.

In summary, the key novelty is the neural network design that can change dimensionality of systems in a symplecticity-preserving non-linear way, enabled by mathematical foundations in differential geometry and associated optimization methods.
