# [RLSAC: Reinforcement Learning enhanced Sample Consensus for End-to-End   Robust Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05318)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can reinforcement learning be used to enhance sample consensus methods for robust estimation, allowing for end-to-end learning while retaining the strengths of traditional sample consensus approaches?Specifically, the authors propose a framework called RLSAC (Reinforcement Learning enhanced SAmple Consensus) that models the sampling consensus process as a reinforcement learning task. The key goals seem to be:1) To enable end-to-end learning for robust estimation tasks by using reinforcement learning, avoiding the need to differentiate the sampling and evaluation steps. 2) To retain the robustness benefits of traditional sample consensus methods like RANSAC by incorporating multiple sampling episodes and initial random sampling.3) To allow the model to learn from data features and historical information to progressively explore better hypotheses over multiple sampling episodes.So in summary, the central hypothesis appears to be that modeling sampling consensus as a reinforcement learning process can enable robust end-to-end learning while retaining the strengths of traditional sample consensus approaches. The proposed RLSAC framework aims to demonstrate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing RLSAC, a novel framework that enhances sample consensus with reinforcement learning for end-to-end robust estimation. The key aspects are:- Modeling the sampling consensus process as a reinforcement learning task, where an agent learns to select good minimal sample sets from data. This allows end-to-end learning and avoids differentiating the sampling process.- Designing a new state encoding strategy that includes both current data features and historical memory features like previous actions and residuals. This guides the agent to progressively explore better hypotheses. - Using the inlier ratio of hypotheses as reward signals for training the agent, enabling unsupervised learning that is tailored to the downstream task.- Providing basic performance with initial random sampling in each episode, while allowing the agent to improve over multiple episodes. - Demonstrating strong performance on 2D line fitting and fundamental matrix estimation tasks. The results show robustness to noise, ability to explore progressively, and state-of-the-art accuracy.- Proposing an extendable framework that is not limited to specific tasks and can be applied to other sampling consensus problems.In summary, the key contribution is developing a novel reinforcement learning based approach to enhance traditional sample consensus for end-to-end robust estimation. The proposed RLSAC framework achieves improved performance while retaining interpretability.
