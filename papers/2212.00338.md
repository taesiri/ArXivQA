# [3D-Aware Object Goal Navigation via Simultaneous Exploration and   Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00338)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we enable a 3D-aware agent to efficiently perform object goal navigation in unseen environments?

The key points are:

- Object goal navigation is an important task for embodied AI agents to navigate to target object instances in unseen environments. 

- Existing methods rely on 2D representations (maps, graphs, etc.) which lack comprehensive 3D spatial understanding. 

- Directly learning policies from 3D data like point clouds is challenging due to high complexity and computational costs.

- This paper proposes a framework to enable a 3D-aware agent for object goal navigation via:

1) An online 3D point fusion module to efficiently construct a 3D representation.

2) Simultaneous exploration and identification policies operating on the 3D data to guide navigation.

3) Discrete action spaces for the policies to improve sample efficiency.

4) Experiments showing state-of-the-art navigation performance among modular methods with lower training costs.

In summary, the core research question is how to design an efficient 3D-aware agent architecture and learning framework to advance performance on the object goal navigation task. The key ideas are using online 3D fusion, simultaneous policies, and discrete actions to make 3D-based navigation tractable and effective.
