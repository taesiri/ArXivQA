# [Generating Fine-Grained Human Motions Using ChatGPT-Refined Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02772)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Fine-Grained Human Motion Diffusion Model (FG-MDM) for generating fine-grained and stylized human motions from textual descriptions. The key idea is to leverage ChatGPT to paraphrase short text prompts into detailed descriptions of motions for different body parts. These fine-grained descriptions better guide the transformer-based diffusion model to focus on both global and local motion information during training. Experiments demonstrate FG-MDM's superior ability over previous state-of-the-art methods to produce motions matching complex input texts, even those depicting motions outside the training distribution. The method also shows strong generalization capability in qualitative and user studies for fine-grained and stylized motion generation. A carefully designed prompt enables efficient fine-graining of texts while two types of text encodings guide local and global motion generation. By re-annotating motions through detailed body part descriptions, FG-MDM associates new motions to parts in the training distribution, enabling handling of novel motions. In summary, through fine-grained guidance, the proposed diffusion framework achieves impressive text-to-motion generation quality and generalization ability.
