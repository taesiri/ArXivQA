# [Magic123: One Image to High-Quality 3D Object Generation Using Both 2D   and 3D Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17843)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that using both 2D and 3D diffusion priors together can lead to higher quality 3D object generation from a single image compared to using either 2D or 3D priors alone. Specifically, the paper proposes that:- 2D priors allow for greater exploration and imagination in generating 3D geometries, but may lack 3D consistency. - 3D priors enable more precise and consistent 3D geometry, but have lower generalization due to limited 3D training data.- By combining both 2D and 3D priors using a tradeoff parameter, the method can balance between exploration and exploitation in geometry generation.The key research questions addressed are:1) Can jointly leveraging 2D and 3D priors improve single image 3D reconstruction over using either alone?2) How can the tradeoff between 2D and 3D priors be managed to optimize geometry quality?3) Does the proposed approach advance state-of-the-art in image-to-3D generation, as evaluated on benchmarks?The two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization framework called Magic123 is proposed to test this hypothesis, using a novel view guidance loss combining 2D and 3D priors. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets suggest the method outperforms baselines.In summary, the central hypothesis is that combining 2D and 3D diffusion priors can achieve better quality 3D reconstruction from an image compared to using either alone. The paper proposes and tests a method to achieve this.
