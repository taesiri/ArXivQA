# [Magic123: One Image to High-Quality 3D Object Generation Using Both 2D   and 3D Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17843)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that using both 2D and 3D diffusion priors together can lead to higher quality 3D object generation from a single image compared to using either 2D or 3D priors alone. Specifically, the paper proposes that:- 2D priors allow for greater exploration and imagination in generating 3D geometries, but may lack 3D consistency. - 3D priors enable more precise and consistent 3D geometry, but have lower generalization due to limited 3D training data.- By combining both 2D and 3D priors using a tradeoff parameter, the method can balance between exploration and exploitation in geometry generation.The key research questions addressed are:1) Can jointly leveraging 2D and 3D priors improve single image 3D reconstruction over using either alone?2) How can the tradeoff between 2D and 3D priors be managed to optimize geometry quality?3) Does the proposed approach advance state-of-the-art in image-to-3D generation, as evaluated on benchmarks?The two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization framework called Magic123 is proposed to test this hypothesis, using a novel view guidance loss combining 2D and 3D priors. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets suggest the method outperforms baselines.In summary, the central hypothesis is that combining 2D and 3D diffusion priors can achieve better quality 3D reconstruction from an image compared to using either alone. The paper proposes and tests a method to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called "Magic123" for generating high-quality 3D objects from a single image. The key ideas are:- A two-stage coarse-to-fine approach. In the coarse stage, they optimize a neural radiance field (NeRF) to get a low-resolution 3D shape. In the fine stage, they use a differentiable mesh representation to refine the shape and texture at higher resolution. - Leveraging both 2D and 3D diffusion priors to guide novel view synthesis in each stage. This allows trading off between "exploration" (using more 2D prior for increased imagination) and "exploitation" (using more 3D prior for better consistency).- Introducing a parameter to control the balance between the 2D and 3D priors. Setting this parameter allows controlling the level of detail vs consistency in the generated 3D shape.- Using textural inversion and monocular depth regularization to encourage consistent appearance across views and prevent bad solutions like flat geometry.Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets, they show Magic123 achieves state-of-the-art results in generating detailed 3D shapes from single images compared to previous methods. The ability to control the 2D/3D tradeoff and generate high-quality 3D is a key advantage of their approach.
