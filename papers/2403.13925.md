# [Reducing Large Language Model Bias with Emphasis on 'Restricted   Industries': Automated Dataset Augmentation and Prejudice Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit bias derived from biased training data and inherent model architecture. This is concerning for "restricted industries" like defense and medicine where data is limited.  
- Prior work categorizes types of biases but lacks quantitative metrics to measure bias. Also, debiasing methods rely on human annotation which introduces more bias.

Proposed Solution:
- Automated dataset augmentation using "bias producers" (broad categories like ethnicity) and "biasers" (specific examples) to expand small datasets without external data.
- New metric "db-index" to quantify bias in datasets based on cosine similarity to a biased dataset. Values near 0 are better.  
- New metric "mb-index" to quantify model bias based on perplexity and "stereotype score". Lower values are better.

Methodology:
- Augmented tiny military datasets using ethnicity as bias producer. Reduced db-index compared to original data.
- Fine-tuned LLMs on augmented and original data. LLMs with augmented data had lower perplexity, stereotype scores and mb-index.

Main Contributions:
- Automated dataset augmentation method to reduce LLM bias, especially for restricted industries
- Db-index to quantify bias in datasets
- Mb-index to quantify bias in LLMs considering both performance and stereotyping tendency
- Demonstrated the above methods can reduce bias in military LLMs

Limitations and Future Work:
- Test on larger datasets and LLMs
- Create online platform to check model/data bias before deployment
