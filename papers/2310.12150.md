# [Understanding Retrieval Augmentation for Long-Form Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12150)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not appear to have a single central research question or hypothesis. Rather, it presents a study that analyzes how retrieval augmentation impacts answer generation by large language models (LLMs) for long-form question answering. The main research goals seem to be:

1) Analyze how using different LMs but the same evidence documents impacts the generated answers in terms of surface patterns and attribution. 

2) Analyze how using different evidence documents of varying relevance impacts the answers generated by the same LMs in terms of surface patterns and attribution.

3) Collect human annotations on attribution to have a benchmark for evaluating automatic attribution methods.

4) Evaluate existing natural language inference (NLI) models on detecting attribution in the long-form QA domain using the collected dataset. 

5) Provide insights into attribution patterns like which parts of the answer tend to be less supported, and what are the main reasons for lack of attribution.

So in summary, this paper does not have a single central hypothesis, but rather conducts a comprehensive study analyzing how retrieval augmentation impacts answer generation by LLMs for long-form QA through both automatic metrics and human annotations. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of this process and provide insights for future work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. They present a controlled study on how retrieval augmentation impacts long-form question answering, which is an under-explored area. Specifically, they analyze the impact on two aspects - surface patterns of the generated answers as well as attribution of the answers to the evidence documents.

2. For studying attribution, they collect a new dataset of human annotations on whether sentences in long-form answers can be attributed to the evidence documents. This allows them to analyze attribution patterns and benchmark methods for automatic attribution detection. 

3. Their analysis provides new insights on attribution patterns in long text generation. For example, they find the last generated sentence is much less attributable than earlier ones, and the order of evidence documents impacts the order of information in the answers. 

4. They evaluate existing natural language inference models on the attribution detection task and find the best performing model is reasonably effective but still lags behind human performance. This benchmark could facilitate future work on improving automatic attribution detection.

5. Through manually categorizing unsupported sentences, they identify the main causes of lack of attribution are retrieving non-relevant documents and hallucinating facts not in evidence. This suggests directions to improve faithfulness in retrieval augmented language models.

In summary, the main contribution is conducting a comprehensive analysis on the impact of retrieval augmentation for long-form question answering, including collecting supporting data and benchmarks. Their findings provide new insights and highlight open challenges in this domain.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper presents a controlled study analyzing how retrieval augmentation impacts surface features and attribution of long-form answers generated by language models, finding that relevant documents substantially change the answers while irrelevant ones do not, and that automatic methods can identify unsupported sentences fairly well but still fall short of human performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of long-form question answering and retrieval augmentation:

- Focus on Long-Form Question Answering: This paper specifically focuses on studying retrieval augmentation in the context of long-form question answering. Much prior work has studied retrieval augmentation in shorter tasks like factoid QA or language modeling. Studying long-form QA provides new insights as it requires generating much longer, knowledge-rich responses.

- Controlled Study with Varying Evidence Documents: The paper presents a controlled study varying both the language models and evidence documents used during generation. This allows them to isolate the impact of retrieval, as opposed to much prior work that studied existing systems as black boxes. The controlled setup is novel.

- Emphasis on Attribution: The paper emphasizes evaluating attribution - whether the generated text can be attributed to the evidence documents. This is an understudied but important aspect. The newly collected human annotations and analysis of attribution provides novel insights.

- Benchmarking Automatic Methods: By collecting annotation and proposing automatic metrics for evaluating attribution, the paper facilitates future work on improving attribution in long-form QA. The benchmarking of existing methods is valuable.

- Analysis of Unsupported Sentences: The analysis of different types/causes of unsupported sentences generated provides useful insights into where models struggle with grounding to evidence documents.

Overall, the controlled setup, emphasis on attribution, and insights from human annotation make this paper's approach fairly unique compared to related work. The analysis yields novel findings about how retrieval impacts different models in long-form QA.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing better methods for multi-document summarization and synthesis. The authors found that incorrectly combining information from separate documents was one cause of unsupported sentences. They suggest developing summarization methods that can better synthesize information across multiple documents for more faithful and accurate retrieval-augmented text generation.

- Developing retrieval-augmented LMs or fine-tuning approaches after introducing evidence documents. The authors found that LMs do not always generate sentences that can be attributed to the evidence documents, even when provided relevant documents only. They suggest developing models that are designed or fine-tuned in a retrieval-augmented setting for more faithful generation.

- Improving the retriever and evidence document selection. The authors found retrieval failure was a major cause of unsupported sentences. They suggest improving the retriever components to provide more sufficient evidence documents. Also the order and relevance of evidence documents impacts the generated text.

- Improving methods for automatically detecting attribution. The authors showed existing NLI models can reasonably identify unsupported sentences but still lack behind human performance. Their new dataset could help further improve automatic attribution detection.

- Analyzing other attribution patterns like order sensitivity. The authors found information order in evidence documents affects order in the generated text. More analysis on how models order and use evidence could provide insights.

- Evaluating on broader set of models and data. The authors experimented on a limited set of models and data. Testing on more diverse models and datasets could reveal more insights about retrieval augmented text generation.

In summary, the main suggestions are developing better summarization and synthesis methods, improving retriever and evidence selection, designing models for retrieval augmented settings, and improving automatic attribution detection. Broader evaluation and analysis is also needed.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores the impact of retrieval augmentation on long-form question answering using large language models (LLMs). The authors perform a controlled study by generating answers using the same LLM but varying the relevance of in-context evidence documents, as well as using different LMs with the same evidence documents. They analyze surface patterns of the generated answers as well as attribution of the answers to the evidence documents. Annotation of sentence-level attribution shows models like WebGPT trained with retrieval augmentation are more faithful to evidence documents compared to LLMs like GPT-3.5 and Alpaca. The study reveals new insights including that later sentences in long answers are much less supported by evidence, and that information order in evidence documents impacts order in the answer. The authors also evaluate existing natural language inference models on identifying unsupported sentences, finding they outperform baselines but still lag behind human performance. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how retrieval impacts long text generation by LLMs. The authors suggest directions like training LMs to be aware of evidence documents and improving multi-document summarization as future work.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper presents a study on how retrieval augmentation impacts long-form question answering by large language models. The authors conduct a controlled study where they fix the language model but vary the evidence documents provided, and also where they fix the evidence documents but vary the language model used. They analyze how these changes impact surface features of the generated answers as well as the attribution of the answers to the evidence documents. The surface features analyzed include length, diversity, fluency and specificity. For attribution analysis, they collect human annotations on whether each sentence in the generated answer is supported by the evidence documents. They also evaluate existing natural language inference models on this collected dataset for automatically predicting attribution. 

Paragraph 2: The analysis reveals that both relevant and irrelevant evidence documents substantially change the surface statistics of the generated answers, even for the same language model. Answers tend to follow the order of information presented in evidence documents. The authors also find that attribution varies significantly across language models - a model trained specifically with retrieved documents achieves much better attribution than others. The best automatic method for judging attribution reaches average F1 score of 60, showing promise while still lagging behind human performance. Overall, the paper provides new insights on how retrieval impacts language models in long form question answering through controlled studies on varying language models and evidence documents. The paper suggests improving faithfulness to evidence documents as an important direction, such as designing models to synthesize information from documents and improving the retriever components.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method of generating plausible counterfactual explanations for model predictions with natural language inputs. The key idea is to construct counterfactual examples by replacing words/phrases in the original input to minimally change the prediction, while preserving semantic coherence and logical consistency. 

The method has three main steps:

1) Given an input text and model prediction, they first identify "pivotal" words/phrases that are most influential on the prediction by computing gradients of the prediction with respect to the word embeddings. 

2) They then generate candidate counterfactuals by replacing the pivotal tokens with their closest neighbors in the embedding space that cause the desired prediction change. Multiple candidates are generated by sampling neighbors.

3) Finally, they rerank the candidates by leveraging a pretrained masked language model (BERT). The candidates are evaluated based on three criteria - fluency, semantic similarity to the original input, and consistency of named entities/numeric values. The highest ranked counterfactual is selected as the final output.

By combining gradient-based search for pivotal words and semantic filtering of candidates with BERT, the approach avoids nonsensical outputs and produces counterfactuals that are minimally edited, fluent and logically consistent with the original input. The human evaluation shows the method generates plausible and useful counterfactuals compared to baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of understanding how retrieval augmentation impacts long-form question answering. Specifically, it is investigating how providing different language models with in-context evidence documents affects the surface patterns and attribution of the generated long-form answers. 

The key questions the paper is aiming to address are:

1) How do different language models make use of the same in-context evidence documents during answer generation? Do they exhibit different behaviors and generate answers with different surface patterns or attribution when given the same documents?

2) How does varying the relevance or quality of the in-context evidence documents impact answer generation for the same language model? Do surface patterns and attribution change when provided with high-quality relevant documents versus low-quality or irrelevant documents? 

3) Can we automatically evaluate the attribution of generated long-form answers to the in-context evidence documents? How does automatic evaluation compare to human judgement of attribution?

4) What insights can we gain about how language models incorporate and synthesize information from multiple in-context evidence documents during long-form answer generation? Are there any patterns or common failure modes?

So in summary, the key focus is on conducting a controlled study to analyze the impact of retrieval augmentation on surface patterns, attribution, and information synthesis during long-form question answering across different language models and evidence document sets. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how retrieval-augmented language models work in this complex generation task.
