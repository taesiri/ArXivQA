# [Stream of Search (SoS): Learning to Search in Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Stream of Search (SoS): Learning to Search in Language":

Problem:
- Transformer models struggle with planning, search, and backtracking, causing issues like error compounding and difficulty with lookahead tasks. This limits their ability to solve complex reasoning problems.

Proposed Solution: 
- Represent the process of search as a "stream of search" (SoS) in language, including mistakes, backtracking, exploration, etc. 
- Systematize search components like states, actions, backtracking into a unified language and instantiate this for the Countdown numbers game.
- Generate a diverse training set of Countdown search trajectories using different symbolic search algorithms. 
- Train a transformer model from scratch on this Stream of Search dataset to learn search abilities.
- Improve the model using policy alignment methods like APA and STaR.

Key Contributions:
- A unified language to represent components of symbolic search strategies in text.
- A Stream of Search training framework to teach transformers search through language. 
- Experiments showing models trained on SoS trajectories outperform models trained only on optimal paths.
- Policy improved SoS models can flexibly utilize and even discover new search strategies, solving 36% previously unsolved problems.
- Address issues like error compounding and lookahead challenges by teaching language models to search, backtrack, and recover from mistakes.

In summary, the key insight is to represent the messy process of search as language so transformers can learn more effective reasoning abilities. SoS models trained this way outperform models exposed only to clean solutions, and can self-improve to solve more complex problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes representing the process of search as a flattened string of text called a "stream of search" to teach language models to solve problems by searching, allowing them to explore mistakes and backtrack during training rather than only seeing clean solutions, and shows they can self-improve to flexibly use and potentially discover new search strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to teach language models to solve problems by searching, representing the search process in language as a "stream of search" (SoS). Specifically:

- They propose representing different components of search strategies (exploration, backtracking, pruning, etc.) in a unified language and serializing the search process into text to create streams of search. 

- They train a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of diverse search trajectories on a "Countdown" math game, demonstrating that models trained on search trajectories substantially outperform models trained only on optimal solutions.

- They show the model can self-improve its search abilities using policy improvement techniques like APA and STaR, solving over 30% more previously unsolved problems.

- Their key insight is that exposing models to suboptimal exploration and backtracking instead of only final solutions enables language models to learn more flexible search strategies. This addresses issues like error compounding and limited lookahead that transformers have struggled with.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing a method to represent search as text to teach language models to search and plan, and showing this "Stream of Search" approach improves performance on a challenging search task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Stream of Search (SoS): Representing the search process as a flattened string to allow language models to learn search strategies.

- Countdown: The game used as a testbed for evaluating search abilities. A generalization of the 24 game.  

- Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA): A reinforcement learning method used to improve the SoS model's search policy.

- Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR): Another method using expert iteration to improve the SoS model.

- Exploration, backtracking, pruning: Key elements of search that are represented in the SoS language.

- Heuristics: Simple numeric functions used to guide the search, like sum heuristic and multiply heuristic in the paper. 

- Alignment scores: Metrics introduced to understand which symbolic search strategies the trained SoS model correlates with.

So in summary, Stream of Search, Countdown game, policy improvement methods like APA and STaR, components of search, heuristics, and alignment scores seem to be the key ideas and terms. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes representing the search process as a flattened string called a "stream of search" (SoS). What are the key advantages of serializing the search process in this way rather than using explicit tree-based representations? How does it allow the model to learn better internal search strategies?

2) The paper defines a vocabulary for different components of search algorithms like exploration strategies, backtracking, pruning etc. How does explicitly representing some of these components help the model learn, compared to leaving everything implicit? What is a good balance between making operations explicit vs implicit?  

3) The paper shows that models trained on suboptimal search trajectories outperform models trained only on optimal solutions. Why does learning from mistakes and unsuccessful searches lead to better planning abilities? How does this relate to human learning?

4) The SoS framework is shown to work for the Countdown game which has a large search space. What are the characteristics of tasks where this approach would be most beneficial compared to other planning methods? When might it struggle?

5) How exactly does the Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) method allow the model to discover new and improved search strategies not present in the original training data? What is the role of the shifting reference policy?

6) The paper hypothesizes that the SoS framework helps models handle the issues of error compounding and lookahead tasks better. What specific mechanisms allow SoS models to overcome these issues compared to regular LMs? 

7) The paper leaves state evaluations implicit while making some search operations explicit. What are the tradeoffs with instead using explicit heuristic functions vs learning implicit ones? When might each approach be better?

8) The initial SoS training data is generated from hand-designed heuristic search algorithms. How might we move to less constrained self-supervised or unsupervised methods to generate this data?

9) The paper focuses on the Countdown game. What other planning tasks and domains could benefit from adopting the SoS framework? What adaptations would it require?

10) The paper proposes using policy improvement techniques like APA and STaR over methods like PPO for stability reasons. Could on-policy RL methods also allow models to discover improved search strategies when trained on SoS? What are the comparative benefits and challenges?
