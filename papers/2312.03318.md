# [Complementary Benefits of Contrastive Learning and Self-Training Under   Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03318)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the complementary benefits of self-training and contrastive pretraining under distribution shift. Through experiments on 8 distribution shift datasets, the authors find that combining self-training (using FixMatch) after contrastive pretraining (using SwAV) yields significant improvements in accuracy (3-8%) on target out-of-distribution data compared to using either method alone. However, in semi-supervised learning settings without distribution shift, the benefits of combining the two methods are negligible. To understand this, the authors analyze both techniques theoretically in a simplified model of distribution shift. Their analysis shows that contrastive pretraining performs "feature amplification", increasing reliance on invariant features over spurious ones. However, some dependence on spurious features remains, hurting out-of-distribution generalization. Self-training after contrastive pretraining initialization can then improve "linear transferability", reducing reliance on spurious features by fitting a linear probe on target unlabeled data. Thus, the two techniques provide complementary benefits under distribution shift. The theoretical intuitions are supported by experiments probing learnt representations. Overall, the paper demonstrates that self-training and contrastive learning should be combined to maximize accuracy on out-of-distribution data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the complementary benefits of self-training and contrastive learning under distribution shift, finding that their combination yields significant accuracy gains in unsupervised domain adaptation settings by improving linear transferability and learning invariant features, while providing negligible benefits in semi-supervised learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating that combining self-training and contrastive learning leads to significant performance improvements in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) settings with distribution shift between labeled source data and unlabeled target data. Specifically, it shows 3-8% higher accuracy compared to using either self-training or contrastive learning alone across 8 distribution shift datasets.

2) It theoretically analyzes self-training and contrastive learning in a simplified distribution shift setting to provide intuition about why the combination works well. The key ideas are: (i) contrastive learning amplifies invariant features over spurious features (feature amplification); (ii) self-training, when initialized with a good classifier from contrastive learning features, can effectively minimize reliance on spurious features and improve linear transferability from source to target.

3) It connects the theoretical intuitions back to experiments, showing that contrastive learning mainly improves the representations while self-training over contrastive learning features boosts performance by improving linear transfer of classifiers from source to target.

In summary, the main contribution is providing both empirical evidence and accompanying theory to demonstrate the complementary benefits of combining self-training and contrastive learning specifically under distribution shift.

The paper investigates combining self-training and contrastive learning for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution shift between a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain. It finds that these two techniques offer complementary benefits - contrastive learning amplifies invariant features while self-training improves linear transferability. This combination outperforms either technique alone on UDA benchmarks. The paper also explores why the benefits are not as synergistic for semi-supervised learning without distribution shift. Overall, it provides an empirical and theoretical analysis of integrating self-training and contrastive learning under distribution shift.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining self-training and contrastive learning (STOC) for unsupervised domain adaptation. Why might these two methods offer complementary benefits under distribution shift? What are the key strengths of each method that STOC aims to leverage?

2. The paper finds that STOC substantially improves over either self-training or contrastive learning alone on UDA benchmarks. However, the gains are much more modest for semi-supervised learning experiments. What might explain why combining these methods has more synergy under domain shift?

3. Contrastive learning is hypothesized to perform "feature amplification", increasing reliance on invariant features. How might this initialization aid downstream self-training? What assumptions need to hold for self-training to successfully build off these representations? 

4. The theoretical analysis introduces a simplified model of distribution shift involving invariant and spurious features. How well does this model align with real-world distribution shifts? What other kinds of shift might be captured or missed by this model?  

5. How do the augmentation assumptions made in the theoretical analysis compare to real-world data augmentations? Could failures related to imperfect augmentations explain some gaps between theory and experiment?

6. The linear probing analysis suggests contrastive learning improves representations while self-training refines features to enable better linear transfer. Do you think these methods might also shape representations in complementary ways? How could this be tested?

7. The paper assumes a covariate shift setting. How might the story change under other kinds of shift, like concept shift or label shift? What new challenges or opportunities might arise?

8. The method relies on a two-stage training process. Do you think similar gains could be achieved with an approach that integrates self-training and contrastive losses? What challenges would need to be addressed?

9. How sensitive is the performance of STOC to algorithm choice? Would the conclusions hold if different self-supervised and self-training methods were substituted? What drives synergy between the methods?

10. The method achieves strong performance on several distribution shift benchmarks. Do you think similar gains would transfer to real-world applications? What practical issues might need to be addressed before deployment?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Machine learning models suffer performance drops when tested on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, even under natural distribution shifts. This is an issue in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA).
- Two popular techniques to address this are self-training and contrastive pretraining. Self-training uses model predictions on unlabeled target data to create pseudo-labels for retraining. Contrastive pretraining learns representations by enforcing consistency between differently augmented views of unlabeled source and target data.
- Despite their popularity and compatibility, the complementary benefits of combining self-training and contrastive learning have not been explored for UDA.

Main Contributions
- Empirically evaluates self-training over contrastive learning (STOC) on 8 distribution shift datasets. Finds it substantially improves over either approach alone in UDA by 3-8%, but offers negligible gains for semi-supervised learning.
- Provides theoretical analysis in a simplified distribution shift setup showing: (1) Contrastive pretraining amplifies invariant features over spurious ones. (2) Self-training further improves linear transferability when initialized with a sufficiently accurate contrastive pretrained model.
- Shows these theoretically grounded notions also explain real dataset trends. Contrastive pretraining improves representation quality over ERM. Self-training then further refines features to enable better OOD generalization of linear predictors.

Proposed Solution
- Leverage unlabeled source and target data using contrastive pretraining with SwAV. Then reuse target unlabeled data to self-train the resulting model with FixMatch.
- Empirically evaluates on UDA benchmarks and provides a theoretical model connecting self-training's ability to improve linear transferability and contrastive pretraining's feature amplification.
