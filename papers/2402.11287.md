# [Dense Matchers for Dense Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11287)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Long-term dense tracking of points in videos is useful for applications like 3D reconstruction and localization, but has not been extensively studied compared to sparse tracking. 
- Optical flow methods work well for consecutive frames but degrade over long durations due to error accumulation.
- Recent dense matchers like DKM and RoMa can match distant frames but don't handle occlusions well.

Proposed Solution: 
- Integrate dense matchers DKM and RoMa into the MFT tracking framework which chains multiple optical flows over different time intervals.
- Show that MFT improves performance over direct matching or flow chaining for RAFT, DKM and RoMa.
- Propose ensembling strategies that combine strengths of RAFT (good occlusion estimation) and RoMa (accurate matches)

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate compatibility of MFT framework with different dense matchers DKM and RoMa instead of just RAFT.
- Show consistently better performance from chaining flows compared to direct matching or flow concatenation.  
- Propose ensemble method using RAFT's occlusion prediction and selective use of RoMa's positions when it predicts visible points.
- Achieve accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art sparse trackers, in a causal setting.

Limitations and Future Work:
- Ensemble strategy needs two networks operating concurrently. Future work on co-training single network could help. 
- Occlusion accuracy lags behind state-of-the-art trackers.
- Need new datasets with dense foreground and background point annotations.
