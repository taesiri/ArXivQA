# [Hierarchical Generative Network for Face Morphing Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing face morphing attack methods either sacrifice image quality or compromise identity preservation capability. Landmark-based morphing methods suffer from artifacts like blurring and ghosting while generating realistic-looking images that preserve identities well. Generation-based morphing methods produce good quality images but fail to effectively preserve identities. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a hierarchical generative network for face morphing (HGFM) to generate high-quality images while preserving identities better. The key ideas are:

1) Use a hierarchical structure with one global and multiple local generators to extract both global consistency and local detailed facial information from contributing face images. This extracts finer details compared to using just a single global generator.

2) Employ a geometry loss using landmark-based morph image as supervision to help preserve geometric information. Use a combined identity loss with multiple face recognition models to better preserve identities.

3) Introduce a mask-guided image blending module to remove artifacts outside facial regions and improve visual quality.

Main Contributions:

1) A hierarchical generative network architecture to capture both global consistency and local detailed facial information for better quality and identity preservation. 

2) Novel loss functions - a geometry loss using landmark morphed images as supervision and a combined identity loss using multiple face recognition models to enhance identity preservation capability.

3) A mask-guided image blending module to eliminate artifacts outside facial regions and further improve visual quality.

Experiments show state-of-the-art performance compared to previous landmark and generation-based morphing methods. The generated morphed images are more realistic, preserve identities better and can bypass multiple face recognition systems.
