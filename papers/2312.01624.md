# [GVFs in the Real World: Making Predictions Online for Water Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01624)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates using reinforcement learning prediction methods, specifically temporal difference (TD) learning, to make accurate multi-step predictions on real data from a drinking water treatment plant. The data exhibits complex properties like seasonality, sensor drift, and mode changes, making prediction challenging. The authors construct an approximate state to deal with partial observability, using a simple trace-based memory. They then compare predictions encoded as general value functions (GVFs), which are exponentially discounted sums of future observations, to classical n-step predictions from time series analysis. They find that with suitable pre-training on historical data and online updating, the TD agent achieves lower error overall compared to n-step predictions. Finally, they highlight the importance of online learning, showing a TD agent that updates predictions continually in deployment significantly outperforms a fixed predictor trained only on historical data. The work provides practical insights on designing predictive systems for industrial applications that must operate continually in complex, non-stationary environments.
