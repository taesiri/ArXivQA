## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Offline Fictitious Self-Play for Competitive Games":

Problem: 
This paper tackles the problem of offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for competitive games, which is challenging compared to cooperative tasks. Specifically, two key issues make offline learning difficult in competitive games:

1) Unable to conduct self-play due to the lack of interactions with changing opponents in offline setting. Self-play is essential for learning policies in competitive games. 

2) Real-world datasets only cover part of the state and action spaces, making it hard to identify Nash equilibria.

Proposed Solution:
To address these issues, the paper proposes "Offline Fictitious Self-Play" (Off-FSP), the first practical offline MARL algorithm for competitive games. The key ideas are:

1) Simulate interactions with various opponents by re-weighting the fixed dataset using importance sampling. This allows learning best responses against arbitrary opponents.

2) Build an "Offline Self-Play" framework that iterates between generating re-weighted datasets and learning best responses. This enables self-play learning without interactions.

3) Implement Fictitious Self-Play in the Offline Self-Play framework to approximate Nash equilibria with the fixed dataset. 

Main Contributions:

1) Propose a weighting technique to simulate plays against different opponents using importance sampling of fixed dataset. This allows open-ended best response learning.

2) Introduce Offline Self-Play that alternates between re-weighting dataset and learning best responses to enable self-play without interactions.  

3) Implement Fictitious Self-Play on Offline Self-Play to approximate Nash equilibria with fixed datasets.

4) Off-FSP is the first practical offline MARL algorithm for competitive games that can work with any offline RL method and reduce exploitability given partially covered real-world datasets.

5) Experiments on Leduc Hold'em Poker show Off-FSP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline MARL baselines.
