# [Offline Fictitious Self-Play for Competitive Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00841)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Offline Fictitious Self-Play for Competitive Games":

Problem: 
This paper tackles the problem of offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for competitive games, which is challenging compared to cooperative tasks. Specifically, two key issues make offline learning difficult in competitive games:

1) Unable to conduct self-play due to the lack of interactions with changing opponents in offline setting. Self-play is essential for learning policies in competitive games. 

2) Real-world datasets only cover part of the state and action spaces, making it hard to identify Nash equilibria.

Proposed Solution:
To address these issues, the paper proposes "Offline Fictitious Self-Play" (Off-FSP), the first practical offline MARL algorithm for competitive games. The key ideas are:

1) Simulate interactions with various opponents by re-weighting the fixed dataset using importance sampling. This allows learning best responses against arbitrary opponents.

2) Build an "Offline Self-Play" framework that iterates between generating re-weighted datasets and learning best responses. This enables self-play learning without interactions.

3) Implement Fictitious Self-Play in the Offline Self-Play framework to approximate Nash equilibria with the fixed dataset. 

Main Contributions:

1) Propose a weighting technique to simulate plays against different opponents using importance sampling of fixed dataset. This allows open-ended best response learning.

2) Introduce Offline Self-Play that alternates between re-weighting dataset and learning best responses to enable self-play without interactions.  

3) Implement Fictitious Self-Play on Offline Self-Play to approximate Nash equilibria with fixed datasets.

4) Off-FSP is the first practical offline MARL algorithm for competitive games that can work with any offline RL method and reduce exploitability given partially covered real-world datasets.

5) Experiments on Leduc Hold'em Poker show Off-FSP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline MARL baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Offline Fictitious Self-Play, a practical model-free offline reinforcement learning algorithm for finding approximate Nash equilibria in competitive games using only pre-collected datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Offline Self-Play (Off-SP) and Offline Fictitious Self-Play (Off-FSP), the first practical model-free offline algorithm for finding Nash equilibria in competitive games using only previously collected datasets. Specifically:

1) Off-SP enables approximating self-play with different opponents by reweighting a fixed dataset. This allows learning best responses to arbitrary opponents with offline RL. 

2) Off-FSP implements fictitious self-play on top of Off-SP to find Nash equilibria. It iteratively learns best responses and updates average strategies based on sample probabilities rather than actual strategies.

3) Off-FSP is compatible with any single-agent offline RL method in its best response learning step. This allows handling challenges with real-world incomplete datasets better than prior methods.

4) Experiments in Leduc Hold'em poker show Off-FSP variants significantly outperform existing offline competitive learning methods. The method also shows potential to approach Nash equilibria given datasets with partial coverage of the game's state-action space.

In summary, the key contribution is a practical offline learning algorithm for competitive games that can work with real-world imperfect datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Offline reinforcement learning - Learning and improving policies from previously collected datasets without online interactions. A key focus of this paper.

- Competitive games/zero-sum games - Games with opposing objectives where one player's gain results in the other player's loss. Finding Nash equilibria is a common goal. 

- Self-play - A learning paradigm where agents continuously refine policies by playing against evolving versions of themselves. Enables finding equilibria but doesn't directly work offline.

- Fictitious self-play - An algorithm that combines fictitious play and self-play to find Nash equilibria in extensive-form games. Adapted for offline learning in this paper.

- Offline self-play - A proposed learning framework to enable changing opponents for strategy improvement in offline settings.

- Offline Fictitious Self-Play (Off-FSP) - The proposed practical offline algorithm combining offline self-play and fictitious self-play to approximate Nash equilibria.

- Importance sampling - A technique used to reweight offline datasets to simulate games against different opponents. Enables offline self-play.

- Extrapolation error - Error arising in offline RL when acting on out-of-distribution states unseen in training data.

So in summary, key concepts relate to offline learning of competitive game strategies, using fictitious self-play, offline self-play frameworks, and addressing challenges like extrapolation error.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an offline learning framework called Offline Self-Play (OSP). Can you explain in more detail how OSP enables strategy play against changing opponents with a fixed dataset? What are the key techniques that make this possible?

2. Offline Fictitious Self-Play (Off-FSP) is proposed in this paper to implement fictitious self-play on top of OSP to find Nash equilibria. How does Off-FSP approximate the interaction with different opponents and learn best responses using importance sampling on the fixed dataset?

3. The paper claims Off-FSP is the first practical model-free offline algorithm for competitive games. What makes it more practical compared to prior model-based methods like OEF? What are the limitations of OEF that Off-FSP aims to address?  

4. How does Off-FSP aggregate the average strategy in samples rather than learning an interactable average strategy like in regular Fictitious Self-Play? What is the motivation behind this design choice and what are its advantages/disadvantages?

5. What challenges arise when applying Off-FSP to real-world datasets that do not satisfy the assumptions of being fully covered and real-equivalence? How does the use of offline RL algorithms help address these challenges?

6. The experiments combine Off-FSP with different offline RL algorithms like CQL, BCQ and CRR. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of using each of these algorithms within Off-FSP? How do they compare empirically?

7. How do the experimental results demonstrate Off-FSP's ability to find NE under different degrees of state-action coverage in the datasets? What trends can be observed regarding exploitability as coverage changes?

8. Why is directly solving NE in the induced subgames insufficient when dealing with incomplete real-world datasets? How does Off-FSP with offline RL do better?

9. The paper discusses the complexity of OOD actions - neither arbitrary selection nor total exclusion is claimed to be optimal. Based on the results, what are your views regarding the right approach for handling OOD actions in Off-FSP?

10. The method is evaluated on a relatively simple poker game environment. What are some challenges and open questions regarding the scalability of Off-FSP to much larger, complex game environments?
