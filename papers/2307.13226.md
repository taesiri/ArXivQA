# [Strivec: Sparse Tri-Vector Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13226)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to represent 3D scenes accurately and compactly using neural radiance fields. Specifically, the paper proposes a new neural scene representation called "Sparse Tri-Vector Radiance Fields" which uses a set of sparsely distributed, compactly factorized local tensor grids to model the radiance field. The key ideas are:

- Using multiple local tensor grids instead of a single global tensor grid to exploit the spatial sparsity and local coherence of natural 3D scenes. This allows distributing tensors only around scene surfaces rather than entire space.

- Factorizing each local tensor compactly into a sum of rank-1 triple vector outer products using CP decomposition. This exploits local spatial coherence to effectively model each region with a low-rank representation. 

- Adopting multi-scale tensor grids to capture both local and global structure.

The central hypothesis is that combining these ideas - sparsity, localized low-rank factorization, and multi-scale modeling - will lead to more accurate and compact radiance field representations compared to previous global, high-rank, or single-scale approaches. The experiments aim to validate that this representation achieves higher rendering quality with fewer parameters.

In summary, the key research question is how to design a neural radiance field representation that is accurate, compact, and efficiently exploits the spatial structure of 3D scenes. The proposed Sparse Tri-Vector Radiance Fields is their solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel neural scene representation called Sparse Tri-Vector Radiance Fields (Strivec). The key ideas and contributions are:

- It represents a 3D scene radiance field using a sparse set of small local tensor grids instead of a single global tensor grid. This allows more efficient modeling of complex local scene details. 

- Each local tensor grid is compactly factorized into triple vectors using CP decomposition, exploiting local spatial coherence. This is more compact than global vector-matrix decomposition used in prior work like TensoRF.

- Multi-scale local tensor grids are used to capture geometry and appearance details at different scales. Features from neighboring tensors across scales are aggregated to model the radiance field. 

- The sparse set of local tensors are directly distributed around the scene surface based on coarse geometry, avoiding modeling empty space. This leads to greater efficiency than global representations.

- Strivec achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality on synthetic and real datasets while using far fewer parameters than prior work. It outperforms both global representations like TensoRF and local voxel/point representations.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel sparse tri-vector radiance field that effectively combines the benefits of both local and global representations for modeling complex scenes efficiently and accurately. The compactness and superior results are enabled by the local tensor factorization.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in neural radiance fields:

- Representation: This paper proposes a novel radiance field representation using sparsely distributed, compactly factorized local tensor grids. This is a unique hybrid of previous global (e.g. NeRF, TensoRF) and local (e.g. Neural Volumes, PointNeRF) representations.

- Tensor factorization: It builds on TensoRF's use of tensor factorization, but focuses on local tensors with CP decomposition rather than global tensors/matrices. This exploits local coherence more effectively.

- Sparsity: Leveraging sparse local tensors allocated by coarse geometry avoids modeling empty space like NeRF. This is similar to sparse voxel/point representations but with factorization exploiting coherence.

- Multi-scale: Uses a multi-scale set of local tensors, unlike most prior sparse representations (voxel/point) focused on single scale. Captures multi-frequency geometry/appearance.

- Performance: Achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while using far fewer parameters than NeRF, voxel, PointNeRF, TensoRF, etc. Uniquely combines benefits of sparse representations and tensor factorization.

- Limitations: Slower to optimize than some methods optimized for speed like Instant-NGP. Less robust for scenes not well-aligned with coordinate axes than NeRF.

Overall, the paper introduces a novel radiance field representation that efficiently combines the strengths of both global and local representations via sparse, factorized local tensors. The results demonstrate superior rendering quality and compactness over prior art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving the rank estimation for local tensors. The paper mentions that it is challenging to accurately estimate the rank for local regions, which limits the performance. Developing better rank estimation techniques for local tensors could help improve results.

- Exploring different tensor factorization strategies. The paper mainly uses CP decomposition for the local tensors, but mentions vector-matrix decomposition could also be explored as an alternative. Comparing different factorization methods may lead to better approaches. 

- Modeling higher-frequency details. The paper notes that it is difficult for their current method to capture very fine details in scenes. Enhancing the ability to model high-frequency signals could help improve reconstruction of intricate geometry and textures.

- Scaling up to large scenes. The current method uses local tensors for efficiency, but may still face challenges for very large environments. Investigating approaches to efficiently scale the method could enable modeling of large-scale scenes.

- Improving runtime performance. Though faster than some baselines, the method is not yet optimized for speed. Exploring ways to accelerate the model optimization and inference could help deploy it in more real-time applications.

- Generalizing across scenes. The current model requires per-scene optimization. Developing techniques to generalize across a distribution of scenes could allow for one-shot novel view synthesis.

In summary, the main future work suggested is around improving rank estimation, comparing tensor factorization strategies, capturing high-frequency details better, scaling up the approach, speeding up the runtime, and generalizing across scenes. Advancing these aspects could build on the method to achieve even higher quality and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a summary of the paper in one paragraph:

The paper presents a novel neural representation called Sparse Tri-Vector Radiance Fields (Strivec) for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Strivec represents a 3D scene as a radiance field using sparsely distributed and compactly factorized local tensor grids, leveraging tensor decomposition techniques. In particular, each local tensor represents a local radiance field and is compactly modeled by a Canonical Polyadic decomposition into tri-vector factors encoding spatial feature distributions. Multi-scale tensor grids are used to capture geometry and appearance at different scales. For rendering, features from neighboring tri-vector components across scales are aggregated to reconstruct volume density and view-dependent color. Experiments show Strivec achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality using significantly fewer parameters than previous methods on both synthetic and real datasets. The key benefits are exploiting both sparsity and local spatial coherence in scenes, as well as the compactness of tri-vector factorization.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new neural scene representation called Sparse Tri-Vector Radiance Fields (Strivec) for high-quality novel view synthesis. The key idea is to represent a 3D scene as a radiance field modeled by a sparse set of small local tensors distributed around the actual scene surface. Each local tensor encodes a local radiance field and is compactly factorized into a sum of triple vector outer products using CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. This allows exploiting both sparsity and local spatial coherence in the scene. Specifically, sparsity is achieved by distributing the local tensors only around the scene surface detected from a fast coarse geometry estimation, avoiding modeling empty space. Spatial coherence is exploited by the low-rank CP factorization within each local tensor region. To leverage multi-scale spatial commonalities, multiple tensor grids at different resolutions are used whose features are aggregated for final view synthesis. Experiments show Strivec achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with significantly fewer parameters than previous methods like iNGP and TensoRF on both synthetic and real datasets.

In summary, this paper presents a novel radiance field representation for novel view synthesis based on sparsely distributed and compactly factorized local tri-vector tensors. It combines the benefits of both sparsity and local spatial coherence modeling. Experiments demonstrate superior rendering quality and compactness compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. The key contributions are the introduction of sparsely distributed local tensors that avoid modeling empty space, the use of CP decomposition to exploit local spatial coherence within each tensor, and the multi-scale tensor grids to capture geometric and appearance commonalities at different resolutions.
