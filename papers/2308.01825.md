# [Scaling Relationship on Learning Mathematical Reasoning with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How does the pre-training loss, amount of supervised data, and amount of augmented data influence the math reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs)?

The key hypotheses explored in the paper are:

- Pre-training loss is a better indicator of an LLM's reasoning performance than model size or parameter count. Lower pre-training loss correlates with better reasoning ability.

- There is a log-linear relationship between the amount of supervised data used for fine-tuning and the LLM's reasoning performance. More data leads to better performance, but with diminishing returns.

- Augmenting the supervised data with new reasoning paths generated via rejection sampling can further improve an LLM's reasoning ability. The key factor is increasing the diversity of reasoning paths, which can be achieved by combining samples from multiple models. 

- Better pre-trained models benefit less from additional supervised or augmented data compared to worse models.

So in summary, the central research question is understanding how pre-training quality, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence and scale with an LLM's mathematical reasoning performance. The key hypotheses are that pre-training loss is most indicative of reasoning ability, and that more diverse reasoning paths in both supervised and augmented data lead to better generalization and performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Investigating the scaling relationship between large language model (LLM) capacity and performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. Specifically, analyzing how pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence reasoning ability.

2. Finding empirically that pre-training loss is a better indicator of reasoning performance than model parameter count. And that models with lower pre-training loss improve less with more supervised data. 

3. Proposing a simple rejection sampling method to augment training data by sampling and selecting correct reasoning paths from supervised LLMs. Showing this rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) improves reasoning performance, especially for lower-performing LLMs.

4. Demonstrating that RFT performance improves primarily with more distinct reasoning paths in the augmented data. And that combining rejection samples from multiple models can further enhance RFT performance.

5. Achieving significant accuracy improvements on the GSM8K benchmark by combining rejection sampling data from multiple LLMs, pushing LLaMA-7B to 49.3% from 35.9% with supervised fine-tuning alone.

In summary, the key contributions are empirically analyzing scaling relationships for learning mathematical reasoning, proposing a simple yet effective RFT method for data augmentation, and showing performance improvements from combining rejection sampling data across models. The core findings relate pre-training quality, supervised data, and reasoning path diversity to mathematical reasoning ability.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a short analysis comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper investigates the scaling laws governing large language model performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. Similar work has examined scaling laws in other domains like image classification and language modeling, but there is less prior work studying mathematical reasoning specifically.

- The key contribution is empirically characterizing how model scale (size), dataset size, and pre-training loss affect performance on math reasoning benchmarks like GSM8k. The authors find pre-training loss is more predictive of reasoning ability than pure model size.

- The techniques used include supervised fine-tuning, in-context learning, and data augmentation via rejection sampling. These are common practices for training and evaluating large language models. The rejection sampling method for data augmentation is similar to prior work.

- A unique aspect is studying ensembles of rejection sampling outputs from multiple model sizes. This further improves results, showing diversity is beneficial.

- Compared to prior work on math reasoning for LLMs, this paper takes a more systematic approach to studying scaling. It does not introduce fundamentally new techniques, but provides a solid empirical characterization of scaling laws using established methods.

- A limitation is the study only examines a few model sizes on one benchmark task. Additional experiments on more models and datasets would strengthen the conclusions.

In summary, this is a focused contribution providing empirical scaling laws for math reasoning in LLMs using standard techniques. It complements prior work and helps characterize how reasoning ability improves with model and data size. More extensive experiments would help verify the observed patterns.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate the scaling relationship for even larger language models, such as models with trillions of parameters. The authors focused their study on models up to 70B parameters, but suggest examining how the trends continue with models orders of magnitude larger.

- Explore the scaling laws with more complex and diverse mathematical reasoning tasks and datasets. The authors used the GSM8K dataset, but suggest analyzing scaling on more comprehensive math benchmark suites. 

- Develop methods to generate more diverse reasoning paths, especially for large models that tend to overfit the training data. The authors discuss the need for better decoding methods to produce more distinct reasoning paths from large models for data augmentation.

- Analyze how scaling laws may differ when pre-training language models on math-specific corpora, compared to pre-training on general domain data. The authors propose pre-training on math data as a direction to explore.

- Derive more rigorous scaling laws by accounting for differences in model architectures, pre-training datasets, tokenization schemes, etc. The authors could not directly compare scaling coefficients between models due to such differences.

- Explore how transfers and distillation may enable small models to attain reasoning skills of large models, while being more parameter-efficient. The authors suggest this as an alternative to simply scaling up model sizes.

- Develop better methods for aligning language model behavior with human reasoning through reinforcement learning, preference learning, etc. The authors suggest leveraging such techniques to improve reasoning.

In summary, the main future directions focus on studying larger models, more diverse reasoning tasks, generating better training data, developing more rigorous scaling laws, and aligning models with human reasoning processes. The authors propose several promising research avenues to further understand and improve mathematical reasoning in language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the scaling relationship between the mathematical reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) and factors including pre-training loss, amount of supervised data, and amount of augmented data. The authors find that pre-training loss is better correlated with reasoning performance than parameter count. They show a log-linear relationship between supervised data amount and model performance, with diminishing returns for better pre-trained models. To augment data, they propose rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) where models generate correct reasoning paths as extra training data. RFT improves performance more with more distinct reasoning paths, especially for weaker models. Combining rejection samples from multiple models pushes LLaMA-7B accuracy to 49.3%, much higher than supervised fine-tuning at 35.9%. Overall, pre-training loss is key, and RFT can efficiently improve reasoning, but lower pre-training loss is the fundamental solution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the scaling relationship between the mathematical reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) and factors including pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount. The authors first analyze the relationship between pre-training loss and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning (ICL) performance on the GSM8K benchmark. They find a negative linear correlation, suggesting pre-training loss is a better indicator of reasoning ability than parameter count. Next, the authors analyze SFT performance with varying amounts of GSM8K training data. They observe a log-linear relationship, with diminishing returns as pre-trained model quality improves. To augment data without human effort, the authors propose rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT), using SFT models to generate correct reasoning paths as extra training data. The key factor influencing RFT performance is found to be the amount of distinct reasoning paths. Combining rejection samples from multiple SFT models further improves RFT, pushing LLaMA-7B accuracy to 49.3%, significantly above its SFT accuracy of 35.9%.

In summary, this paper empirically analyzes how pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence math reasoning ability in LLMs. Key findings include: pre-training loss being a good indicator of reasoning performance, a log-linear relation between SFT accuracy and training data amount, and RFT performance depending on distinct reasoning path amount. The authors demonstrate RFT as a simple yet effective technique to improve reasoning ability by augmenting reasoning paths, especially when combining samples from multiple SFT models. The analysis provides insight into the scaling relationship for learning mathematical reasoning with LLMs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates how the pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the mathematical reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). The authors first analyze the relationship between pre-training loss and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) performance on the GSM8K dataset, finding a negative linear correlation.
