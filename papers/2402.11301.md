# [ReViT: Enhancing Vision Transformers with Attention Residual Connections   for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11301)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Standard Vision Transformers (ViTs) suffer from feature collapse in deeper layers due to the global nature of their self-attention mechanism. This causes them to lose focus on low-level visual features like shapes, edges, and colors which are useful for visual recognition tasks. They also lack robustness to translations.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a Residual Attention Vision Transformer (ReViT) which introduces a residual attention learning technique to improve feature diversity and translation invariance. It propagates attention maps between consecutive self-attention layers using a weighted summation, enabling accumulation of low-level attention features across layers. This helps counter over-globalization of attention and retain useful low-level cues.

Key Contributions:

- Introduce a novel ViT architecture with residual attention modules that accumulate low-level visual features across layers while preserving global context, enhancing feature diversity.

- Show superior image classification performance over ViT baselines on ImageNet1K and other datasets like CIFAR10/100 and Oxford Flowers/Pets.

- Demonstrate enhanced robustness to translations on Oxford datasets compared to baseline ViT, proving ability to better handle varying object scales and positions.  

- Analyze attention map globality with and without residual attention, proving residual connections help maintain localization and slow down over-globalization.

- Visual analysis of feature maps shows ReViT's improved ability over ViT to integrate low-level attention features like shapes and edges.

- Show general applicability by seamlessly integrating module into detection/segmentation frameworks like Swin and MViTv2, achieving performance gains on COCO2017.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in improving vision transformers using an elegant residual attention technique to accumulate multi-level attention features across layers. Both quantitative and qualitative results prove the benefits.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Vision Transformer architecture called Residual Attention Vision Transformer (ReViT) that enhances visual feature diversity and model robustness by propagating attention information between consecutive self-attention layers to incorporate low-level features while preserving the original global modeling capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel ViT-based architecture called Residual Attention Vision Transformer (ReViT). Specifically, ReViT introduces an attention residual learning technique to enhance the performance of visual recognition tasks by:

1) Propagating attention information between consecutive transformer layers to accumulate attention from shallow to deeper layers. This enables the network to identify low-level features while preserving the ability to extract global context.

2) Contrasting the over-globalization of the standard self-attention mechanism in ViT, which leads to loss of feature diversity in deeper layers (feature collapse). The residual attention mechanism enhances feature diversity.

3) Achieving improved performance compared to standard ViT architectures on image classification benchmarks like ImageNet1K, CIFAR10/100, Oxford Flowers-102, and Oxford-IIIT Pet.

4) Demonstrating better robustness to transformations like horizontal/vertical shifts and scale changes compared to standard ViT.

5) Seamlessly integrating into multiscale architectures like Swin Transformer and MViTv2 to achieve performance gains in downstream tasks like object detection and instance segmentation.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of residual attention learning to enhance visual feature diversity and translation invariance of vision transformers, while maintaining computational efficiency.
