# [Robot Synesthesia: In-Hand Manipulation with Visuotactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01853)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a visuotactile approach called "Robot Synesthesia" for dexterous in-hand manipulation of objects. The key idea is to represent the tactile data from sensors on the robot hand as a tactile point cloud fused with the visual point cloud from a camera. This allows the two distinct modalities - vision and touch - to be integrated into a unified spatial representation that facilitates better reasoning and decision making. The method is trained in simulation using reinforcement learning with full state information to obtain a teacher policy, which is then distilled into a student policy that takes only the visuotactile inputs. Experiments on complex tasks like rotating a double ball system and generalizing to novel objects demonstrate superior performance over baseline methods. The approach transfers effectively to the real robot without any real-world data. Ablation studies validate that the proposed tactile point cloud provides richer spatial information and helps the network focus on critical contact points. Overall, this visuotactile synesthesia approach, inspired by human perception, enables more dexterous in-hand manipulation by robots.
