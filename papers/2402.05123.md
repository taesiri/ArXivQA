# [A Survey on Data Selection for LLM Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05123)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences and enhancing their capabilities. However, existing instruction datasets often lack quality, diversity and efficiency. 

- Selecting high-quality subsets from instruction datasets is crucial for reducing costs and improving instruction-following in LLMs. However, this is challenging due to the complex considerations involved.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper categorizes existing data selection methods into 4 types - based on indicators, trainable LLMs, powerful LLMs like ChatGPT, and small models. 

- Methods using indicators directly assess data quality. Trainable LLM methods design scoring formulas leveraging the LLMs' own capabilities. Powerful LLM methods utilize LLMs like ChatGPT for scoring instructions. Small model methods use auxiliary models in a comprehensive selection pipeline.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a taxonomy of data selection methods for instruction tuning of LLMs.

- Comprehensively surveys recent advances in this area - highlighting methodology, innovations and results.

- Analyzes evaluation approaches for data selection methods, emphasizing the lack of unified standards. 

- Discusses open challenges regarding efficiency, evaluation standards and model availability. Outlines promising future research directions.

In summary, the paper offers an extensive review of the problem, solutions and evaluation of data selection techniques for enhancing instruction tuning of LLMs - identifying key innovations, results and open issues to advance progress in this crucial area.
