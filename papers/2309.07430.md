# [Clinical Text Summarization: Adapting Large Language Models Can   Outperform Human Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07430)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for clinical text summarization across multiple tasks and domains, with the central hypothesis that LLM-generated summaries can be comparable or superior to those created by human experts. 

The key research questions addressed are:

- How do different LLM architectures, sizes, and adaptation methods compare for clinical summarization tasks?

- Can LLMs outperform human experts in generating high quality summaries as judged by physicians? 

- What are the remaining challenges and limitations faced by both LLMs and humans?

- How well do standard NLP evaluation metrics correlate with physician judgments on summary quality?

To address these questions, the authors conduct a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 8 LLMs with various adaptation methods on 6 datasets spanning 4 distinct summarization tasks. They then validate their best model (GPT-4) against human experts via a clinical reader study with 6 physicians. Their central finding is that with proper adaptation, LLM summaries can surpass those of human experts in terms of completeness and correctness. The paper provides novel evidence that LLMs are non-inferior and often superior to humans for clinical text summarization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It comprehensively evaluates large language models (LLMs) across multiple clinical text summarization tasks, datasets, and adaptation methods. This is the most thorough assessment to date of contemporary LLM performance on diverse clinical summarization tasks.

2. Through a clinical reader study, it demonstrates for the first time that adapted LLMs can surpass human experts in completeness and correctness when summarizing medical text. This novel finding affirms the feasibility of using LLMs to reduce clinician documentation burden.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in clinical text summarization:

- The paper provides the most comprehensive evaluation to date of large language models (LLMs) for clinical summarization, assessing 8 different LLMs across 4 distinct tasks (radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, dialogue) and 6 datasets. This is significantly more thorough than prior work which often evaluates fewer models on 1-2 tasks.

- The paper demonstrates for the first time via a clinical reader study that LLM-generated summaries can surpass those created by human experts in terms of completeness and correctness. Prior clinical NLP papers have relied more heavily on traditional NLP metrics rather than evaluations by physician experts. This finding of non-inferiority is an important step towards establishing the viability of LLMs for clinical use.

- The qualitative analysis and identification of challenges for both LLMs and human experts is quite insightful. Many prior papers focus solely on quantifying performance rather than trying to understand the limitations of current methods. The authors provide actionable insights to guide future improvements.

- The paper explores a diverse set of contemporary LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Much research uses only open source models, so it's useful to benchmark the leading proprietary models. The analysis also reveals cases where larger models do not necessarily perform better.

- The correlation analysis between NLP metrics and clinical scores is insightful, especially showing semantic metrics like BERTScore better capture correctness. This can inform appropriate evaluation methods as LLMs become more capable.

- Limitations of the study are the focus on English text and the inclusion of only certain medical document types from US institutions. The authors acknowledge the need for expanded benchmarks. There is also room to explore different prompt formulations.

Overall, the rigorous and multifaceted evaluation of a wide selection of LLMs sets a new standard and benchmark for clinical NLP research on text summarization. The paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art while balancing quantitative metrics and qualitative human assessment.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluate LLMs on an even broader range of clinical document types and summarization tasks. The authors note their work does not encompass all clinical documents, so extrapolating the results is tentative. They suggest evaluating longer documents and multi-document summarization tasks as well as expanding to different types of clinical notes beyond ICU notes.

- Develop methods to increase the context length that LLMs can process. The authors note that summarizing very long documents or multiple documents is currently challenging due to the limited context length of models like GPT-4. They suggest approaches like multi-query aggregation or methods to directly increase context length could help address this limitation.

- Create more open-source datasets for clinical summarization tasks. The authors advocate for building more publicly available datasets that cover diverse summarization tasks and longer clinical documents to enable further research and evaluation.

- Conduct more rigorous hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering. The authors acknowledge they only crudely optimized parameters like temperature and prompt wording, so more systematic optimization could further improve LLM performance.

- Include human experts more extensively throughout the evaluation process. The authors emphasize the need for human evaluation, not just NLP metrics, when assessing clinical feasibility of new methods.

- Further analyze the tradeoffs between completeness, correctness, and conciseness. The reader study revealed potential tradeoffs between these attributes, so the authors suggest more work to understand these tradeoffs and how they can be balanced.

- Examine integrating LLMs into clinical workflows. Since the authors' goal is ultimately clinical integration to reduce clinician burden, they suggest research into how best to incorporate LLMs into real clinical workflows.

In summary, the key future directions focus on expanding the types of documents and tasks evaluated, optimizing LLMs for the clinical domain, rigorous human-centered evaluation, and research enabling integration of LLMs into clinical practice.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for clinical text summarization across four distinct tasks: radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, and doctor-patient dialogue. The authors implement domain adaptation methods on eight LLMs spanning six datasets. Through quantitative metrics and a clinical reader study, they demonstrate that adapted LLMs often surpass human experts in terms of completeness and correctness of summaries. The best performing model overall is GPT-4 adapted via in-context learning. Key results include:

- Comparing adaptation methods in-context learning and low-rank tuning, the authors find a tradeoff where low-rank tuning works better for fewer examples while in-context learning improves given more examples. 

- In a reader study, GPT-4 summaries are rated higher than human expert summaries on completeness for all tasks and on correctness overall. For radiology reports, GPT-4 exhibits a tradeoff between correctness (better) and conciseness (worse).

- Semantic metrics like BERTScore and MEDCON correlate more strongly with human judgments of correctness compared to syntactic metrics like BLEU. 

- Both human experts and LLMs face challenges in summarization - humans make lateralization errors in radiology reports while LLMs can hallucinate incorrect information.

Overall, the results indicate LLMs can surpass human performance on clinical summarization, suggesting they could help alleviate documentation burden to improve clinician wellbeing and patient care. The analysis also provides insights to guide further improvements in adapting LLMs for clinical readiness.
