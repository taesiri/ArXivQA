# [SMoT: Think in State Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current prompting approaches for language models rely solely on the model's own exploration of reasoning paths. This leads to fruitless exploration when erroneous routes are pursued, requiring retracing steps and trying alternative paths.
- Humans can abstract optimal solutions to guide reasoning for similar problems, but language models lack this capability currently. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a new State Machine of Thought (SMoT) paradigm to provide language models with efficient reasoning paths using predefined state machines, eliminating meaningless exploration.
- Uses a multi-agent mechanism with separate planning agent and action agent to focus responsibilities and enhance accuracy.
- Planning agent handles overall flow - updating states and iterating event sequences.
- Action agent determines state transitions and actions based on current state and events.

Key Contributions:
- Novel SMoT paradigm to guide language model reasoning using prior knowledge in state machines.
- Multi-agent approach that delegates objectives for improved accuracy. 
- Significantly outperforms existing methods on array reasoning and Taxi navigation tasks.
- Opens opportunities for using pre-established methods to guide language models within boundaries.

In summary, the paper introduces a new way to leverage state machines to provide language models with predefined efficient reasoning paths instead of relying solely on their own exploration. A multi-agent approach focuses responsibilities to different agents. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing prompting methods.
