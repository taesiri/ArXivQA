# [Choosing a Classical Planner with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Automated planning is an important area of AI research with many applications, but is computationally complex. As different planners have varying strengths, there is interest in developing portfolio-based approaches that can select the best planner for a given planning problem. This paper focuses on the task of "online" planner selection, where a planner is chosen for each specific planning problem rather than creating a single schedule. Recent work has used deep learning on graphical representations of planning problems, but there is room for further investigation into architectures and techniques.

Proposed Solution:
This paper explores using graph neural networks (GNNs) for online planner selection. Four GNN architectures are evaluated: GCN, GGNN, GAT, and GIN. Experiments are done with two graph representations of planning problems - grounded and lifted. Different node features are added such as node degree and neighbor type. Three planner selection methods are explored: 1) predict time to solve and pick fastest, 2) predict probability of solving within time bound, 3) use GNN embedding with XGBoost classification.

Contributions:
- Compares four major GNN architectures for planner selection task
- Evaluates grounded versus lifted graph representations
- Analyzes impact of different node features like degree and neighbor type
- Explores predicting time, probability of success, and direct classification
- Proposes combining GNN representations with XGBoost, achieving good accuracy
- Provides analysis and insights into model behaviors and performance
- Best result is 0.9 accuracy using GCN, grounded graphs, and node degree features
- Discusses future work like specialized GNN architectures and additional features

In summary, this paper conducts a thorough investigation of using GNNs for online planner selection across models, graph representations, prediction tasks and features. The combination of GNN embeddings and XGBoost is a novel contribution. Key results and directions for improvement are discussed.
