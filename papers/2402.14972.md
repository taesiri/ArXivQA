# [MultiLS: A Multi-task Lexical Simplification Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lexical Simplification (LS) aims to replace complex words in a text with simpler alternatives while preserving meaning. This helps improve text accessibility for various groups.
- Existing LS datasets focus on only some subtasks of the LS pipeline (e.g. complexity prediction or substitute generation) or certain genres, limiting full system development and evaluation. 
- No prior LS dataset contains both continuous complexity ratings and ranked gold substitutions for the same target words across genres.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces MultiLS, a novel framework to create multi-task, multi-genre LS datasets covering all pipeline subtasks.
- Using MultiLS, the authors create MultiLS-PT - the first Portuguese LS dataset with over 5K target words from Bible, news and biomedical texts. Each target word has gold complexity ratings (1-5 scale) and ranked substitute suggestions annotated by 25 crowdworkers.

Contributions:
- MultiLS framework to enable creation of comprehensive LS datasets for full pipeline model training and evaluation.
- MultiLS-PT - first multi-genre Portuguese LS benchmark with complexity values and substitutes for 5K+ target words.
- Analysis of state-of-the-art models (transformers, LLMs) on MultiLS-PT for complexity prediction, substitute generation and ranking. 
- Insights on impact of genre and context on each LS subtask's performance to inform overall pipeline design.

The MultiLS framework enables the development of versatile LS datasets and systems. MultiLS-PT specifically facilitates advancement of Portuguese text simplification through its multi-task, multi-genre nature.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces MultiLS, a novel framework for creating multi-purpose, multi-genre lexical simplification datasets covering all sub-tasks, and applies it to create MultiLS-PT, the first such dataset for Portuguese.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. **MultiLS**: the first multi-purpose framework for the creation of an all-in-one lexical simplification (LS) dataset covering all sub-tasks of the LS pipeline, including lexical complexity prediction (LCP).

2. **MultiLS-PT**: the first Portuguese multi-genre dataset for LS containing both continuous complexity values and ranked gold simplifications for target words, allowing it to be used for training and evaluating all LS sub-tasks.

3. **Evaluation**: Performance analysis of multiple state-of-the-art models on MultiLS-PT for LCP, substitute generation, and substitute ranking. Models ranged from transformers to large language models.

So in summary, the key contribution is the MultiLS framework and resulting MultiLS-PT dataset which enables, for the first time, the development and evaluation of end-to-end lexical simplification systems covering all sub-tasks for Portuguese across multiple genres.

The paper introduces the MultiLS framework for creating multi-task, multi-genre lexical simplification datasets. It uses this framework to develop MultiLS-PT, the first Portuguese lexical simplification dataset covering all subtasks like LCP, substitute generation, and ranking across genres like news, bible, and biomedical texts. The paper demonstrates applications of MultiLS-PT for various LS tasks and models. So the key focus is on lexical simplification, specifically for Portuguese, enabled through the proposed MultiLS framework and MultiLS-PT dataset to facilitate multi-task learning across genres.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the MultiLS framework for creating multi-purpose, multi-genre lexical simplification datasets. What are some key benefits of having a dataset that covers multiple lexical simplification subtasks and genres? How does this advance the state-of-the-art?

2. The paper introduces MultiLS-PT, the first Portuguese multi-genre dataset for lexical simplification. What makes this dataset unique compared to prior Portuguese lexical simplification datasets? What new possibilities does it enable?

3. The paper experiments with several models on the MultiLS-PT dataset for lexical complexity prediction, substitute generation, and binary comparative lexical complexity prediction. What differences in performance were observed between transformer models and large language models on these tasks? What explanations are provided?

4. For lexical complexity prediction on MultiLS-PT, why did the large language models underperform compared to fine-tuned transformer models? How might the subjective and intrinsic nature of this task contribute to the poor LLM performance?  

5. How did the impact of context and genre vary across the different lexical simplification subtasks when experimenting on MultiLS-PT? What reasons are provided in the paper to explain differences in model performances?

6. Based on the MultiLS-PT experiments, what pipeline of models does the paper recommend as currently optimal for Portuguese lexical simplification? Why are certain models chosen over others for each subtask?

7. How might future work that compares model pipelines trained on MultiLS datasets versus generalized language models for text simplification elucidate the evolving role of LLMs in lexical simplification?

8. How can the ability of the MultiLS framework to control for genre help researchers better develop lexical simplification systems capable of domain generalization? What experiments could be conducted?

9. What open questions remain regarding the viability of multilingual modeling and cross-lingual transfer learning for lexical simplification? How can MultiLS datasets in other languages help address these questions?

10. Beyond improving model performance, what wider potential societal impacts could the MultiLS framework and resulting lexical simplification systems have if deployed for Portuguese or other languages? whose interests could be served or marginalized?
