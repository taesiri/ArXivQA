# [C2P-GCN: Cell-to-Patch Graph Convolutional Network for Colorectal Cancer   Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing CNN and GCN-based methods for grading colorectal cancer histology images divide whole slide images (WSIs) into small patches and build graphs on each patch. This fails to capture overall tissue structure information of the WSI and relies on a large dataset of image patches for training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Cell-to-Patch Graph Convolutional Network (C2P-GCN) that uses a two-stage graph construction approach. 

- First, it constructs a patch-level graph based on cell organization within each patch of a WSI. This captures local tissue structure.

- Second, it builds an image-level graph based on similarity between patches of the WSI, treating each patch as a node. This establishes connections between similar patches across the whole image.

- The constructed dual-level graphs are fed into a multi-layer GCN for classification.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the C2P-GCN architecture that harnesses local tissue structure information via patch-level graphs and forms connections between similar patches across an entire WSI using an image-level graph.

- Comprehensive experiments on two distinct colorectal cancer datasets show C2P-GCN achieves state-of-the-art or better performance compared to recent CNN and GCN methods.

- As C2P-GCN integrates structural data of the entire WSI into a single graph, it requires significantly less training data (over two orders of magnitude less) than other methods while achieving comparable or better accuracy.

In summary, the key innovation is the dual-graph construction approach to capture both local and global tissue structure information across entire WSIs using graph convolutional networks, enabling high performance with very small training data.
