# [A Multimodal In-Context Tuning Approach for E-Commerce Product   Description Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13587)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for generating e-commerce product descriptions from images and text suffer from producing generic, inaccurate descriptions. This is because they are trained on large datasets so focus on common words while neglecting product-specific features. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called ModICT (Multimodal In-Context Tuning) that leverages the in-context learning abilities of large language models (LLMs). 
- It works by using a pretrained image encoder to retrieve a similar product image and constructing an in-context example with the similar product's marketing keywords and description. This shows the LLM how to generate diverse descriptions based on similar products.
- ModICT keeps the visual encoder and LLM decoder/autoregressive parameters frozen so it tunes a small number of parameters. This preserves the original generation capabilities of the LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new setting for e-commerce product description generation from images and marketing keywords.
- Develops a simple yet effective method ModICT that utilizes in-context learning of LLMs to improve accuracy and diversity of generated descriptions.
- Conducts extensive experiments on a newly collected dataset of 300k product samples from 3 categories. Results show ModICT outperforms previous methods by a large margin.
- Analysis shows ModICT can work well even with limited training data and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of inaccurate, generic product descriptions from multimodal inputs by proposing a novel approach ModICT that leverages similarity-based in-context learning of frozen LLMs. Experiments confirm it substantially boosts both accuracy and diversity of generated e-commerce product descriptions.
