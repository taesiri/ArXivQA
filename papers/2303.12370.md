# [Weakly Supervised Video Representation Learning with Unaligned Text for   Sequential Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12370)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn a good video representation in a weakly supervised manner using unaligned text data. Specifically, the paper proposes a method to learn semantic video representations using only the paragraph-level descriptions of videos and the sequence of sentence descriptions for each step, without needing fine-grained alignment between frames and sentences. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Using a coarse-grained contrastive loss between video and paragraph representations can help learn useful global video representations. 

2) Generating pseudo-alignments between frames and sentences based on their temporal order and applying a fine-grained contrastive loss can help learn frame-level representations that capture the semantics of actions.

3) Combining these coarse-grained and fine-grained contrastive losses in a multi-granularity framework can learn good video representations from unaligned text in a weakly supervised setting.

The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by showing that the learned representations transfer well to downstream tasks like video sequence verification and text-to-video retrieval compared to other baseline methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a weakly supervised video representation learning method with unaligned text for sequential videos. The key ideas are:

1. They propose a multiple granularity contrastive learning loss for weakly supervised video-text representation learning, including a coarse-grained video-paragraph contrastive loss and a fine-grained frame-sentence contrastive loss. 

2. To handle the lack of frame-level annotations, they propose to generate pseudo frame-sentence alignments by leveraging the sequential nature of text and videos. They explore maximum-index sorting and Viterbi algorithm to generate pseudo labels for fine-grained contrastive learning.

3. They show the learned representations achieve strong performance on downstream tasks like video sequence verification and text-to-video matching without using timestamp supervision.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to align videos and unaligned text descriptions for learning effective video representations for sequential videos. The key novelty is the proposed pseudo alignment generation and multi-granularity contrastive losses.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a weakly supervised video representation learning method using unaligned text descriptions, with a coarse-grained video-paragraph contrastive loss and a fine-grained frame-sentence contrastive loss based on generated pseudo labels that enforce temporal consistency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in weakly supervised video representation learning:

- It focuses specifically on learning representations for sequential videos, which have not been extensively studied compared to short video clips. Many prior works focus on weakly supervised representation learning for short video clips.

- It proposes using unaligned text descriptions as weak supervision rather than other common forms of weak labels like hashtags or captions. Leveraging unaligned text as supervision is a relatively new direction.

- It introduces a multiple granularity contrastive loss to match video frames to sentences in an unaligned text description. This is a novel way to create pseudo-alignment and supervision between modalities. 

- The multi-granularity loss includes both video/paragraph and frame/sentence contrastive objectives. Other works tend to focus on one level of granularity.

- Experiments demonstrate strong performance on downstream tasks like video sequence verification and text-to-video retrieval compared to other weakly supervised baselines.

- The approach builds on top of a CLIP-style contrastive framework, which is a popular foundation for recent multimodal representation learning papers.

Overall, the key novelties are using unaligned text in a multi-granularity contrastive loss to learn sequential video representations. The results validate this is an effective approach for weakly supervised representation learning compared to other alternatives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the robustness of the method to handle repetitive actions in sequential videos. The authors note that repetitive actions can bias the pseudo-label generation and hurt performance. They suggest exploring ways to make the model more robust to repetitive actions. 

- Scaling up the model and training to handle longer, more complex sequential videos. The current model uses 16 sampled frames, but handling longer videos with more complex procedures may require modifications.

- Exploring semi-supervised or unsupervised approaches. The current method requires unlabeled text descriptions for each video, but removing this requirement could broaden the applicability. Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches are suggested.

- Applying the method to real-world downstream applications. The authors demonstrate promising results on video sequence verification and text-to-video retrieval. Testing the method on real-world applications like healthcare, education, manufacturing etc. is suggested.

- Combining the approach with other supervised signals if available. The current method uses only unaligned text, but incorporating other supervised signals like timestamps or classifications when available could further improve performance.

- Improving generalization across domains and datasets. While promising generalization results are shown, evaluating cross-domain generalization and testing on more diverse datasets is an important future direction.

- Integration with reinforcement and embodied learning. The authors position sequential video understanding as valuable for goal-oriented AI. Integrating the method with reinforcement learning and embodied AI systems is suggested as an impactful direction.

In summary, the main future directions are improving robustness, scaling up, reducing supervision, applying to real-world uses, combining with other signals, improving generalization, and integrating with other learning approaches. Advancing in these areas could help realize the potential of this type of weakly supervised video representation learning approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel weakly supervised video representation learning framework for sequential videos, which does not rely on accurate timestamp-level text-video alignment annotations. The method extracts video and text features from a CLIP-based vision-language model. A coarse-grained contrastive loss enforces matching between the whole video and full text description, while a fine-grained contrastive loss enforces matching between each action and its textual description. To overcome the lack of alignment, the method generates pseudo frame-sentence correspondence based on the sequential nature of videos and text. Experiments on video sequence verification and text-to-video matching tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming baselines by a significant margin and showing strong generalization ability. The key ideas are multiple granularity contrastive losses for weakly aligned video-text pairs and exploiting their temporal sequence information to generate supervision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel weakly supervised video representation learning framework for sequential videos, which leverages unaligned text descriptions and videos. The method uses a vision module to extract frame features from the video, and a language module to encode text descriptions into sentence embeddings. The key contribution is a multi-granularity contrastive learning loss which aligns the video representation with both the full text description (coarse-grained) as well as individual text sentences (fine-grained). To enable fine-grained alignment without exact alignment annotations, the method generates pseudo-labels based on the temporal order of sentences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the learned representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks like video sequence verification and text-to-video retrieval.

In more detail, the coarse-grained contrastive loss uses an InfoNCE loss to match the video representation with the full paragraph description. The fine-grained loss matches video frames with individual sentence embeddings using a cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labels. The pseudo-labels are generated by assuming temporal consistency between frames and sentences, such that a frame matches the current or future sentences, but not past ones. Different techniques are proposed to generate the pseudo-labels, including sorting similarity scores, Viterbi decoding, and uniform splitting. Experiments validate the multi-granularity learning, and show strong transfer performance on sequence verification and text-to-video retrieval tasks. Key limitations are handling repetitive actions and reliance on temporal consistency in the descriptions. Overall, the paper presents a novel weakly supervised learning approach for sequential video representation learning using only unaligned text descriptions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:

This paper proposes a weakly supervised video representation learning framework that can learn from unaligned video and text descriptions. The method uses a transformer encoder to aggregate frame features into a video representation and a pre-trained text encoder from CLIP to encode text descriptions. Two contrastive losses are used: (1) A video-paragraph contrastive loss that matches the whole video to the full text description, and (2) A fine-grained frame-sentence contrastive loss that matches each frame to its corresponding sentence. Since alignments between frames and sentences are not given, the method generates pseudo frame-sentence alignments by sampling using Gumbel-Softmax and enforcing temporal consistency between frames and sentences. The losses are used to train the model and learn effective video representations that can generalize well to downstream tasks like video sequence verification and text-to-video matching.

- Weakly supervised learning - The paper aims to learn effective video representations without requiring detailed temporal annotations (e.g. timestamps of actions). Only video + unaligned text descriptions are used.

- Multi-modal learning - The method combines vision (video frames) and language (text descriptions) via a contrastive learning framework inspired by CLIP.

- Multiple granularity contrastive loss - A key contribution is using loss terms to match video-text at both the full video level as well as the fine-grained frame-sentence level.

- Pseudo labeling - To enable fine-grained contrastive learning without precise alignments, the paper proposes techniques to generate pseudo frame-sentence correspondences based on temporal order.

- Generalization - The learned representations show strong ability to generalize to downstream tasks like video verification and text-to-video retrieval without finetuning.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised video representation learning framework for sequential videos that does not rely on accurate timestamp-level text-video alignments. The method uses a transformer to aggregate frame-level features into a video representation and a pretrained text encoder to encode text descriptions of video segments and the whole video. To model the correspondence between text and video, the authors propose a multiple granularity contrastive loss consisting of a video-paragraph loss that matches the whole video to the full text script, and a frame-sentence loss that matches video segments to sentence descriptions.
