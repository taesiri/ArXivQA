# [Mind Your Format: Towards Consistent Evaluation of In-Context Learning   Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models show impressive capability for few-shot learning, but performance is highly sensitive to the prompt format (template). However, most works ignore this issue in evaluations.
- Different works use different templates when evaluating new methods, making comparisons misleading. Gains may come from better templates rather than methods. 
- There are no universally good templates even for the same model, method and dataset. The best template for one setup fails to transfer to other setups.

Methods & Analysis
- Evaluate 19 models from 7 families (0.77B to 70B parameters) on 4 text classification datasets. 
- Examine sensitivity of standard few-shot learning and methods like ITM, z-ICL, Channel, Calibration to template choice.
- Find high variance across templates in all models and methods. Best templates rarely transfer between models, datasets, number of demonstrations etc.  
- Show that template tuning alone can give gains comparable to advanced methods. Hard to claim gains of new methods are robust.

Proposed Solution & Contributions  
- Propose Template Ensembles to aggregate predictions across templates. More robust and higher average performance.
- Highlight overseen issue of template sensitivity that makes evaluations of new methods unfair and unreliable. 
- Show tuning templates, models, methods together is important but transferring best templates is very difficult.
- First step towards accounting for template sensitivity by simple test-time augmentation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts a comprehensive study of how the format of prompts (templates) substantially impacts the performance of in-context learning across different models, datasets, and methods, finding that there are no universally good templates and that results cannot be reliably compared between methods using different templates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Conducting a comprehensive study of the influence of prompt template format on the in-context learning performance of language models across 19 models and 4 datasets. The paper shows that choice of template format can have a major impact on performance, with suboptimal templates sometimes reducing scores to random guess levels even for large models.

2) Demonstrating that there are no universally best performing templates that transfer consistently across models, datasets, number of demonstrations, etc. The paper shows that template tuning is very difficult since what works best for one setup fails to transfer to even slight variations in the setup.

3) Proposing "Template Ensembles" as a baseline solution to improve robustness to template choice. This simple test-time augmentation approach averages predictions across multiple templates and is shown to boost average performance while reducing sensitivity to the specific templates used.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous analysis showing that prompt engineering/template design is a crucial but overlooked factor in evaluating in-context learning techniques, and baseline methods like Template Ensembles can help improve robustness. The paper calls for taking template sensitivity into account when developing and benchmarking new models and methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Prompt template sensitivity - The paper examines how sensitive language model performance is to small variations in the format of prompt templates used for few-shot learning.

- In-context learning (ICL) - The capability of large language models to learn new tasks from just a few demonstrations provided in the context. A main focus of the paper.

- Template transferability - The paper investigates whether high-performing prompt templates for one model/task transfer well to other models and tasks. They find transferability is very limited.

- Template ensembles - A method proposed to improve robustness by aggregating predictions over multiple prompt templates. 

- Verbalizers - Components of a prompt template that convert input examples and labels into natural language.

- Prediction methods - Different techniques for extracting predictions from language model outputs, e.g. directly taking the best label vs more complex approaches.

- Example selection methods - Strategies for selecting which examples to provide in the prompt context, e.g. random vs more advanced example selection.

In summary, the key focus is understanding and improving the sensitivity of in-context learning to details of the prompt formatting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the Template Ensembles method proposed in the paper:

1. How did you determine the ideal ensemble size of 4-5 templates? Did you experiment with larger ensemble sizes and find diminishing returns? What was the tradeoff in considering ensemble size versus computational efficiency?

2. Have you studied the effect of similarity between templates in the ensemble? Does having more diversity between templates improve the robustness or performance overall? 

3. You state that smaller ensembles exhibit unstable performance, sometimes scoring lower than a single best template. Did you analyze what causes that instability and how it could be avoided?

4. How do the computational requirements of using Template Ensembles compare to searching exhaustively for an optimal template? At what point does the ensemble become more efficient?

5. Do you think Template Ensembles can fully mitigate the impact of "template overfitting" where a template might happen to score high for one particular model/dataset despite not generalizing well to other conditions? 

6. Have you considered weighting the predictions from each template in the ensemble non-uniformly based on some measure of expected reliability for that template?

7. Could more advanced ensembling techniques like stacked generalization be applied on top of the Template Ensembles to learn optimal weighting schemes for combining predictions?

8. How sensitive is the effectiveness of Template Ensembles to the randomness in how the templates are selected? Is performance consistency better when templates are sampled to maximize diversity?

9. Can you characterize the types of templates that tend to be co-selected for the same ensemble versus providing complementary information to improve robustness?

10. Do you think Template Ensembles solve the problem fully or do you see them more as a practical bandage until more fundamental improvements can be made in prompt/template robustness and transfer learning?
