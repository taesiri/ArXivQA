# [Scalable and Equitable Math Problem Solving Strategy Prediction in Big   Educational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding students' problem-solving strategies is important for adaptive learning systems to provide personalized guidance. However, identifying strategies computationally from student interaction data is challenging, especially when scaling up to large datasets with millions of instances.

- Strategies followed by students are often approximately symmetrical rather than exactly identical. Identifying such approximate symmetries is difficult.

- Strategy prediction models should be equitable, i.e. predict strategies equally well for students at all skill levels to avoid disparate mistreatment. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a mastery-based student and problem embedding called MVec using Node2Vec on a graph encoding relationships between students, problems and knowledge components (KCs).

- Augment Node2Vec graph walks with attention-based mastery estimates over KCs from a transformer model. This captures symmetries stemming from mastery over KCs.

- Use a non-parametric clustering method called DP-Means to cluster MVec embeddings into strategy-invariant groups with approximate symmetry in strategies.

- Progressively refine clusters from coarse to fine using a symmetry scoring function based on positional encodings and alignment.

- Sample strategy prediction model training data from the converged clusters. Use LSTM model for prediction.

Key Contributions:
- Novel mastery-based embedding MVec to capture symmetries in student strategies for problems

- Symmetry-driven non-parametric clustering framework to identify approximate symmetries in strategies

- Demonstrated high accuracy in predicting strategies from small samples of large datasets

- Showed predictive equality, i.e. equitable prediction across student groups at diverse skill levels

- Evaluated approach on two real-world large-scale datasets from MATHia platform

In summary, the paper presents a strategy prediction framework that is highly accurate, scalable and equitable by effectively utilizing symmetries and mastery information from big educational data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper develops a scalable and equitable framework to predict students' math problem-solving strategies by learning mastery-based embeddings of students and problems, clustering them using approximate symmetries in strategies, and training a model on sampled clusters to enable generalization across diverse groups of students.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is a scalable and equitable framework for predicting students' math problem-solving strategies from large educational datasets. Specifically:

- The paper develops a mastery-based student and problem embedding called MVec, which captures similarities between students in terms of the mastery of knowledge components (KCs) used in their problem-solving strategies. This embedding is learned using a combination of Node2Vec on a graph representation and a transformer model to estimate mastery.

- The paper proposes a non-parametric clustering approach using DP-Means to group together student-problem instances that have approximately symmetrical strategies, in order to identify diverse strategy groups from the data. 

- Sampling is done from these diverse strategy groups to train an LSTM model for predicting strategies. This allows the model to generalize over different strategy groups rather than optimizing on any specific group, making it equitable.

- Experiments on two large real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of this approach in predicting strategies using a fraction of the full dataset. The predictions are also shown to be fair for students at different skill levels.

In summary, the main contribution is an equitable and scalable framework for strategy prediction that uses mastery-based embeddings and symmetry clustering to effectively sample from large datasets. The experiments demonstrate accuracy, scalability as well as fairness of predictions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an embedding called MVec that incorporates mastery information into the representation. How exactly is mastery quantified and incorporated into the Node2Vec framework to generate the MVec embeddings? 

2. The non-parametric clustering method utilizes approximate symmetries between strategies to group similar instances. Can you explain in more detail how the symmetry score between two strategies is computed using positional encodings and alignment?

3. The coarse-to-fine refinement of clusters is a key aspect of the clustering approach. What is the intuition behind starting with coarse clusters and iteratively refining them? How specifically is the cluster coherence score used to control this refinement process?

4. The paper argues that sampling from diverse clusters helps ensure predictive equality across different student groups. What is the underlying principle that leads to this fair and unbiased model when trained on such clusters?

5. The ablation study shows that incorporating mastery information into the embeddings (MVec) gives better performance compared to just using symmetries. Why does mastery play such a key role in identifying better training samples?

6. How exactly does the attention mechanism quantify the mastery of a student on a particular knowledge component? What aspects of the attention values indicate higher or lower mastery?

7. The edit distance between strategies is used to create subgroups with rare vs common strategies. How does the performance over these subgroups illustrate that rare strategies can also be effectively predicted?  

8. The examples in Table 2 show how students adapt strategies between problems. How does the model architecture allow it to predict such adapted strategies accurately?

9. Fig. 5 shows an example of coarse clusters getting refined into strategy-invariant clusters. Can you walk through this example and explain how the refinement process works?

10. The paper demonstrates scalability in terms of both dataset size and training time compared to baselines. What aspects of the method contribute to making it more scalable?
