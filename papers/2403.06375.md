# [FlowVQTalker: High-Quality Emotional Talking Face Generation through   Normalizing Flow and Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06375)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "FlowVQTalker: High-Quality Emotional Talking Face Generation through Normalizing Flow and Quantization":

Problem:
Existing talking face generation methods struggle to produce realistic and expressive results. Two main limitations are identified:
1) Lack of diversity in nonverbal facial dynamics like expressions, blinks and poses, leading to unrealistic deterministic outputs. 
2) Inability to generate high-quality textures and details like emotion-aware wrinkles and clear teeth, which are essential for expressiveness.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FlowVQTalker to address the above limitations. It contains two main components:

1) Flow-based Coefficient Generator (FCG) 
- Uses normalizing flow to map facial expression coefficients to a mixture distribution model
- Allows sampling diverse coefficients from modeled distribution for nonverbal facial dynamics 
- Achieves controllable emotion transfer using bijective mapping

2) Vector Quantized Image Generator (VQIG)
- Employs a texture-rich discrete codebook for image generation
- Codebook stores high-quality patch features to provide emotion-aware wrinkles and clear teeth
- Fuses identity and texture code with motion code for expressive and high-fidelity talking faces

Main Contributions:
1) Pioneers in applying normalizing flow for emotional talking face generation to ensure diversity
2) Proposes VQIG with codebook for high-quality and expressive texture generation 
3) Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and qualitative realism
4) Achieves both label-based random generation and reference-based control of emotions
5) Generates talking faces with fine details like emotion-aware wrinkles and clear teeth

In summary, FlowVQTalker produces high-quality and expressive talking faces with realistic nonverbal facial dynamics using normalizing flow and vector quantization.
