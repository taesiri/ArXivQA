# [Perseus: Removing Energy Bloat from Large Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06902)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Training large AI models on multiple GPUs consumes massive amounts of energy. However, not all of this energy directly contributes to training throughput. Specifically, the paper identifies two sources of "energy bloat":

1) Intrinsic energy bloat: Due to imbalance in computation time across pipeline stages when using pipeline parallelism for distributed training. Stages not on the critical path run faster than needed, wasting energy. 

2) Extrinsic energy bloat: When multiple pipeline replicas run in parallel (data parallelism) but some pipelines (stragglers) run slower than others. Non-straggler pipelines wasting energy by running faster than the slowest pipeline.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Perseus, a system that creates a unified optimization framework to minimize both intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat in large model training, without slowing down training.

Key ideas:
- Represent the computations in a training iteration as a DAG 
- Annotate each computation node with a planned time and energy schedule
- Formulate an optimization problem to minimize energy under a time constraint 
- Prove the problem is NP-Hard, provide an approximate algorithm
- Algorithm efficiently finds all points on the Pareto frontier of iteration time vs energy 
- Select the optimal point based on straggler status to minimize energy bloat

The system has two components:
1) A framework-independent server that runs the optimization and lookups optimal schedules
2) A client integrated into the training framework that profiles computations online and realizes schedules by tuning GPU frequency

Main Contributions:  
- Identify intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat in large model training
- Formulate a principled graph optimization algorithm to minimize both sources of bloat 
- Introduce the idea of an "iteration time vs energy" Pareto frontier for training
- Design and implement an end-to-end system Perseus that can reduce energy consumption by up to 30% for large model workloads without affecting training throughput.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in optimizing the energy efficiency of large model training by systematically identifying and minimizing unnecessary energy waste. The proposed system Perseus and algorithms demonstrate significant energy savings on real workloads.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Perseus is an optimization framework that identifies and removes two sources of energy bloat (intrinsic caused by computation imbalance and extrinsic caused by stragglers) in large model training using an efficient graph cut-based algorithm to trace the iteration time-energy Pareto frontier.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Perseus, a unified optimization framework that aims to remove both intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat during large model training. Specifically:

1) It identifies two independent sources of energy bloat in large model training - intrinsic bloat that comes from computation imbalance across pipeline stages, and extrinsic bloat that comes from straggler pipelines slowing down the overall training.

2) It proposes an efficient graph cut-based algorithm to characterize the entire "iteration time--energy" Pareto frontier of a training pipeline. This allows Perseus to quickly adapt and find the energy-optimal schedule given any straggler iteration time.

3) Evaluation on models like GPT-3, BERT, Bloom etc. shows that Perseus can reduce per-iteration energy consumption by up to 30% with negligible or no slowdown. This enables energy savings not achievable by prior arts.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying and mitigating two fundamental sources of energy inefficiency in distributed large model training through a principled optimization framework and algorithm.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Energy bloat - Excess or wasted energy consumption that does not contribute to training throughput. The paper identifies two types: intrinsic (due to pipeline imbalance) and extrinsic (due to stragglers).

- Pipeline parallelism - A parallelization strategy that partitions a neural network model across multiple devices. Can lead to imbalance. 

- Stragglers - Slow pipelines that limit the iteration time for synchronous data parallel training.

- Computation DAG - Represents an iteration of training as a directed acyclic graph with computations as nodes. Used for optimization.

- Energy schedule - Annotates each computation in the DAG with a planned time and energy consumption. Realized by setting GPU frequencies. 

- Pareto frontier - The paper aims to enumerate iteration time-energy Pareto optimal schedules to navigate tradeoffs.

- Graph cut algorithm - The core optimization algorithm that efficiently navigates the Pareto frontier.

- Online profiler - Measures per-computation time and energy during training with low overhead.

So in summary, key concepts are around computational DAG representation, Pareto optimality, and the graph cut algorithm to optimize energy bloat arising from intrinsic and extrinsic sources.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper identifies two sources of energy bloat - intrinsic and extrinsic. Can you explain in more depth where these two types of bloat originate from and how they manifest during large model training?

2. The core of Perseus is an iterative algorithm that efficiently characterizes the entire "iteration time-energy" Pareto frontier. Can you walk through this algorithm in more detail and explain the key insights that allow it to work? 

3. Perseus formulates the pipeline energy minimization problem and proves it is NP-hard. What is the significance of this result and how does Perseus get around this theoretical limitation in practice?

4. Explain in more detail how Perseus models a training iteration as a DAG and why this representation is amenable to the graph cut based optimization approach? What are some limitations of this modeling choice?  

5. The way Perseus handles things like tensor parallelism and single-choice operations seems straightforward but clever. Can you expand more on these extensions to the base algorithm? What other types of computation patterns could it likely incorporate easily?

6. Profile gathering seems like an important practical issue for Perseus. Expand more on the online time/energy profiler, how it works around limitations of GPU hardware, and how the error rates you see impact the quality of optimization.

7. Why do you think the energy savings results are consistently underestimated by the large scale training emulator? Could the emulator be improved and if so, how? What are other ways the large scale extrapolation could be evaluated more accurately without access to massive GPU clusters?

8. The scale versus energy savings tradeoff result is interesting. Intuitively, one may expect more pipelines to yield more savings by optimizing all but one. Can you analyze in more depth why strong scaling leads to less extrinsic energy savings per pipeline for Perseus?

9. Compare and contrast in detail the pros and cons of Perseus versus the baselines like Zeus and EnvPipe. What are some things the baselines get right and where do they fall short compared to Perseus?

10. If you were to take Perseus to the next level and productize it, what would be the top 3 practical challenges or gaps in the current research prototype that still need to be addressed?
