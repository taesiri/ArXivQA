# [Perseus: Removing Energy Bloat from Large Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06902)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Perseus, a unified optimization framework that aims to reduce the energy consumption of large neural network model training. The authors identify two types of "energy bloat" that lead to excess energy usage - intrinsic bloat caused by imbalance across pipeline stages, and extrinsic bloat caused by straggler pipelines. Perseus formulates the pipeline energy minimization problem, proves it is NP-hard, and provides an efficient approximation algorithm to generate the complete "iteration time vs energy" Pareto frontier for a training pipeline. It starts from the minimum energy schedule and iteratively speeds up execution time while minimizing energy increase to trace the frontier. At runtime, Perseus can quickly adapt to stragglers by looking up the appropriate energy schedule from the precomputed frontier table. When evaluated on models like GPT-3, BERT, T5 and Wide ResNet, Perseus is able to reduce per-iteration energy consumption by up to 30% in real GPU experiments and large-scale emulations, without noticeable slowdown. The paper makes notable contributions in formally defining and addressing the intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat problems in large scale distributed training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Perseus is a system that identifies and removes two sources of energy waste (intrinsic from computation imbalance across pipelines and extrinsic from straggler pipelines) during large model training using an efficient graph cut-based algorithm to optimize the iteration time-energy tradeoff.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Perseus, a unified optimization framework that aims to remove both intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat during large model training. Perseus introduces an efficient graph cut-based algorithm to characterize the entire "iteration time--energy" Pareto frontier of a training pipeline. This allows Perseus to minimize energy consumption by precisely slowing down computations along the critical path. Experiments show that Perseus can reduce per-iteration energy consumption of large model training by up to 30% with negligible or no slowdown.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Energy bloat - Excess or wasted energy consumption that does not contribute to training throughput. The paper identifies two types: intrinsic (due to pipeline imbalance) and extrinsic (due to stragglers).

- Intrinsic energy bloat - Energy wasted due to imbalance between pipeline stages, where non-critical stages run faster than needed.

- Extrinsic energy bloat - Energy wasted when multiple pipelines run in parallel but some pipelines (stragglers) are slower, forcing others to wait. 

- Critical path - The longest sequence of computations that determines overall iteration time. Non-critical computations can be slowed down without affecting throughput.

- Pipeline parallelism - Splitting a neural network across multiple devices to parallelize training. Can lead to imbalance.

- Data parallelism - Using multiple device replicas to process more data in parallel.

- Stragglers - Slow pipelines that hold back throughput when running multiple pipelines with data parallelism. Can cause extrinsic bloat.

- Pareto frontier - The curve representing optimal tradeoffs between iteration time and energy. Perseus characterizes this to enable optimization.

- Energy schedule - Annotating a computation DAG with planned time and energy consumption for each operation. Perseus produces these to optimize energy.

So in summary, the key focus is on identifying and removing excess energy consumption during large model training without slowing it down, by harnessing concepts like pipeline characterization, critical paths, stragglers, and Pareto optimality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper identifies two sources of energy bloat - intrinsic and extrinsic. Can you explain in more detail the root causes behind each type of energy bloat? How are they fundamentally caused by computation time imbalance?

2. The paper proposes a unified optimization framework to reduce both intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat. At a high level, can you walk through the workflow of how Perseus plans and realizes energy-optimal schedules during training? 

3. Perseus represents a training iteration as a DAG where nodes are computations and edges are dependencies. Can you explain why formulating the problem this way allows Perseus to efficiently optimize the pipeline's energy consumption? 

4. The paper shows that perfectly load balancing pipeline stages is difficult due to the coarse granularity of layers. In your opinion, what are some potential ways the community could explore more fine-grained pipeline parallelism?

5. Perseus introduces the concept of an "energy schedule" - which annotates each computation node with its planned time and energy consumption. What are the benefits of decoupling time and energy planning this way?

6. The paper proves that the Pipeline Energy Minimization problem is NP-Hard. Can you walk through the key steps in their NP-Hardness proof by reduction from the 0/1 Knapsack problem?  

7. Explain the intuition behind Perseus's core optimization algorithm that starts from the minimum energy schedule and iteratively speeds up the schedule. Why does this allow Perseus to trace the entire Pareto frontier?

8. Perseus relies on accurate fine-grained energy profiling of pipeline computations. Discuss the limitations of coarse-grained energy measurements provided by GPUs, and how Perseus gets around this challenge.

9. The paper evaluates Perseus on a range of large model workloads. Can you summarize some of the key observations from the evaluation? How does Perseus compare against other baselines like EnvPipe and Zeus?

10. Perseus focuses exclusively on optimizing energy consumption during training. Can you think of other objectives that could be jointly optimized together with energy, such as carbon emissions or cost? What are the challenges in multi-objective optimization for large model training?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Training large AI models on multiple GPUs consumes massive amounts of energy. However, not all of this energy directly contributes to training throughput. Specifically, the paper identifies two sources of "energy bloat":

1) Intrinsic energy bloat: Due to imbalance in computation time across pipeline stages when using pipeline parallelism for distributed training. Stages not on the critical path run faster than needed, wasting energy. 

2) Extrinsic energy bloat: When multiple pipeline replicas run in parallel (data parallelism) but some pipelines (stragglers) run slower than others. Non-straggler pipelines wasting energy by running faster than the slowest pipeline.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Perseus, a system that creates a unified optimization framework to minimize both intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat in large model training, without slowing down training.

Key ideas:
- Represent the computations in a training iteration as a DAG 
- Annotate each computation node with a planned time and energy schedule
- Formulate an optimization problem to minimize energy under a time constraint 
- Prove the problem is NP-Hard, provide an approximate algorithm
- Algorithm efficiently finds all points on the Pareto frontier of iteration time vs energy 
- Select the optimal point based on straggler status to minimize energy bloat

The system has two components:
1) A framework-independent server that runs the optimization and lookups optimal schedules
2) A client integrated into the training framework that profiles computations online and realizes schedules by tuning GPU frequency

Main Contributions:  
- Identify intrinsic and extrinsic energy bloat in large model training
- Formulate a principled graph optimization algorithm to minimize both sources of bloat 
- Introduce the idea of an "iteration time vs energy" Pareto frontier for training
- Design and implement an end-to-end system Perseus that can reduce energy consumption by up to 30% for large model workloads without affecting training throughput.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in optimizing the energy efficiency of large model training by systematically identifying and minimizing unnecessary energy waste. The proposed system Perseus and algorithms demonstrate significant energy savings on real workloads.
