While some code reuse aids productivity, excessive cloning negatively impacts maintainability and propagates bugs \cite{hummel2010index, kim2017vuddy}. Thus, automatic clone detection is an important research area. % Clones are categorized into four types by similarity: Type-1 (identical), Type-2 (lexically identical), Type-3 (syntactically similar), and Type-4 (semantically similar)~\cite{bellon2007type1_4}. % Type-4 clones are especially challenging to detect due to their semantics, rather than lexical or syntactic similarity.% The effectiveness of clone detectors is contingent upon their ability to distinguish between different forms of code similarities. To better comprehend clone detection, researchers have undertaken a methodical classification of code clones into distinct categories. A widely accepted taxonomy segregates code clones into four types: Type-1 (identical similarity), Type-2 (lexical similarity), Type-3 (syntactical similarity), and Type-4 (semantic similarity) \cite{bellon2007type1_4, roy2007type1_4}. The first three types can generally be encapsulated under the umbrella of syntactic similarities, while the fourth type epitomizes semantic similarities. Given that Type-4 clones may comprise clones that display a wide range of syntactic dissimilarities, they present the most formidable challenge for most clone detection methodologies.There exists extensive literature focusing on code syntactic similarities \cite{sajnani2016sourcerercc, roy2008nicad, nakagawa2021nil}. However, in recent years, attention has gradually shifted toward the study of code semantic similarities. This shift has been facilitated by advancements in the field of deep neural networks. As a result, a plethora of deep learning-based methodologies have been proposed, all designed to discern semantic similarities through a process of data-driven learning \cite{lei2022deep}. These methodologies largely adopt a two-pronged approach: firstly, neural networks are leveraged to generate a vector representation for each code fragment, which is then followed by calculating the similarities between the vector representations of two code fragments to detect clones \cite{wu2020scdetector}.% Recently, the development of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has brought new innovations to the field of deep learning, Researchers find that scaling pre-trained language models (e.g., scaling model size or data size) often leads to an improved model capacity on downstream tasks.% These models \cite{} trained on large corpora of text and code, are capable of solving not only complex tasks in natural language but also a wide variety of code-related programming language in software engineering.% The application of pre-trained large language models has garnered significant interest in the area of software development. As a matter of fact, the development of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has revolutionized the area of deep learning.These models, such as BERT \cite{kenton2019bert} and GPT-1 \cite{radford2018improving}, were pre-trained with specially designed pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled text corpora to learn generalized knowledge.After that, many works such as CodeBERT \cite{feng2020codebert} and CodeT5+ \cite{wang2023codet5+} introduce pre-training to further boost code-related tasks in software engineering.Although these works have a great performance, they still need to be fine-tuned to adapt to different downstream tasks \cite{sun2019fine, liu2023pre}.Recently, researchers have found that scaling PLMs (\eg scaling model size or data size) often leads to an improved model capacity on downstream tasks \cite{kaplan2020scaling}.Although scaling is mainly conducted in model size with similar architectures and pre-training tasks, these large-sized PLMs (\eg GPT-3 \cite{brown2020language}, MPT \cite{MosaicML2023Introducing}, LLaMA \cite{touvron2023llama}) display different behaviors from smaller PLMs (\eg 330M-parameter BERT and 1.5B-parameter GPT-2 \cite{radford2019language}) and show surprising abilities in solving a series of complex tasks with only human instructions rather than fine-tuning to adapt the downstream tasks \cite{wei2022emergent, brown2020language}. % cot的文章Furthermore, since the pre-trained corpus of these large language models (LLMs) contains a huge amount of code tasks, they are also enabled to solve a variety of challenges related to code in software engineering.For example, Feng \emph{et al.}~\cite{feng2023prompting} proposed an automatic technique for accomplishing the bug replay from bug reports through prompt engineering.Deng \emph{et al.}~\cite{deng2023large} proposed a testing tool, using generative and infilling LLMs to generate and mutate various programs for testing the deep learning library.%Xia \emph{et al.}~\cite{xia2023conversation} proposed an approach to generate patches with instant feedback in a conversational style.%Xu \emph{et al.}~\cite{xu2023prompting} proposed a log parsing framework under the in-context inference capability of LLMs.However, there is a lack of understanding of how well these LLMs perform in code clone detection.In our paper, we delve into the potential of leveraging LLMs for detecting code clones.Our hypothesis pivots on the innate ability of LLMs to interpret complex language inputs and generate meaningful outputs. We posit these skills could be harnessed to identify and classify code clones, thus providing a novel approach to a traditional code clone detection problem.Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study to assess the clone detection performance of LLMs like Llama \cite{touvron2023llama}, Alpaca \cite{taori2023alpaca}, Vicuna \cite{zheng2023judging}, StarChat-$\beta$ \cite{Tunstall2023starchat-alpha}, Falcon \cite{almazrouei2023falcon}, MPT \cite{MosaicML2023Introducing}, Llama2 \cite{touvron2023llama2}, Llama2-Chat \cite{touvron2023llama2}, GPT-3.5 \cite{ouyang2022training}, and GPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4}. %using different prompt formulations and code embedding similarities. Our study focuses on the following research questions:\begin{itemize}%[leftmargin=*]% \item RQ1: How effectively can LLMs identify code clones using simple binary prompting?% \item RQ2: How do more complex prompts impact LLM clone detection performance?% \item RQ3: Can a multi-turn conversational prompting strategy (Chain of Thoughts) enhance LLM clone detection capability?% \item RQ4: How do LLM-generated code embeddings compare to interactive prompting for clone detection?% \item RQ5: Is LLM clone detection consistent across different programming languages?\item \emph{RQ1: Can LLMs detect code clones with a simple prompt?}% rq1: 在给予简单二元提示的情况下,LLM在识别代码克隆方面的效果如何?\item \emph{RQ2: How do LLMs perform by using one-step chain-of-thought prompts?}% rq2:提示的复杂性如何影响LLM在代码克隆检测方面的性能?\item \emph{RQ3: Can LLMs perform better by using multi-step chain-of-thought prompts?}% rq3: 是否可以通过使用多回合的对话提示策略(思维链)来提高LLM在代码克隆检测方面的性能?\item \emph{RQ4: How do LLMs perform using code embedding?}% rq4: 在代码克隆检测方面,LLM生成的代码嵌入与交互式提示相比如何?\item \emph{RQ5: How does the performance of LLMs in code clone detection vary across different programming languages?}% rq5: LLM在代码克隆检测方面的性能是否在不同的编程语言之间保持一致?\end{itemize}% \par \noindent \textbf{Summary of Main Findings.}Regarding \textbf{RQ1}, our findings indicate that when utilizing only a simple prompt, clone detection based on open-source LLMs performs better in detecting Type-3 and Type-4 clone pairs compared to existing tools. However, it performs slightly worse in detecting Type-1 and Type-2 clone pairs.GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 have the highest recall and accuracy in almost all clone types. % As for \textbf{RQ2}, we observe that using one-step chain-of-thought reasoning, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 greatly improved due to the intermediate reasoning allowing the big model to think about the code from multiple perspectives. % Surprisingly, when integrating all the intermediate reasoning, GPT-3.5-Turbo decreases effectiveness and is even worse than using a simple prompt, while GPT-4's detection is unaffected. % When generating the reasoning from these different perspectives independently, the detection performance of GPT-3.5-Turbo improves again. This shows that chain-of-reasoning can improve clone detection performance. Regarding \textbf{RQ2}, our observations reveal that employing one-step chain-of-thought reasoning significantly enhances the performance of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. This improvement is attributed to the intermediate reasoning, which allows the larger models to consider the code from multiple perspectives, resulting in more accurate clone detection.Surprisingly, when incorporating all the intermediate reasoning together, GPT-3.5-Turbo's effectiveness decreases, and it even performs worse than when using a simple prompt. In contrast, GPT-4's detection remains unaffected by this integration.% As for \textbf{RQ3}, if multiple reasonings are generated simultaneously, the reasoning of different angles will interfere with each other and decrease the detection results. % We simulate the deep learning-based clone detection by independently generating code explanations of code pair. % We find that the performance of clone detection is also improved. Regarding \textbf{RQ3}, when multiple reasonings are generated simultaneously, we observe that the reasoning from different angles can interfere with each other, leading to a decrease in the detection results. %As a result, the effectiveness of the clone detection process is impacted negatively.Moreover, we also conduct simulations of deep learning-based clone detection by independently generating code explanations for each code pair. This approach yields positive results and can achieve more accurate and reliable clone detection outcomes.Regarding \textbf{RQ4}, when it comes to code embedding, Text-embedding-ada-002 is more effective than specialized CodeBERT models in identifying cloned code, exhibiting superior overall performance.Regarding \textbf{RQ5}, we discover that the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code clones varies across different programming languages, with Python generally producing better results, probably because it is naturally simple and frequently used in training data.% This work provides comprehensive insights into LLM capabilities and limitations for code clone detection. % Our findings will inform future research into enhancing LLM-based clone detection and other software engineering areas.% \textcolor{red}{add results for each RQ}In summary, our paper makes the following contributions:\begin{itemize}    \item We perform the first empirical study to assess the capability of existing LLMs in detecting code clones from five different perspectives (\ie simple prompts, one-step chain-of-thought prompts, multi-step chain-of-thought prompts, code embedding, and multiple programming languages).    \item We open source all the data and code involved in our study and offer valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code clone detection.

As a matter of fact, the development of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has revolutionized the area of deep learning.These models, such as BERT \cite{kenton2019bert} and GPT-1 \cite{radford2018improving}, were pre-trained with specially designed pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled text corpora to learn generalized knowledge.After that, many works such as CodeBERT \cite{feng2020codebert} and CodeT5+ \cite{wang2023codet5+} introduce pre-training to further boost code-related tasks in software engineering.Although these works have a great performance, they still need to be fine-tuned to adapt to different downstream tasks \cite{sun2019fine, liu2023pre}.Recently, researchers have found that scaling PLMs (\eg scaling model size or data size) often leads to an improved model capacity on downstream tasks \cite{kaplan2020scaling}.Although scaling is mainly conducted in model size with similar architectures and pre-training tasks, these large-sized PLMs (\eg GPT-3 \cite{brown2020language}, MPT \cite{MosaicML2023Introducing}, LLaMA \cite{touvron2023llama}) display different behaviors from smaller PLMs (\eg 330M-parameter BERT and 1.5B-parameter GPT-2 \cite{radford2019language}) and show surprising abilities in solving a series of complex tasks with only human instructions rather than fine-tuning to adapt the downstream tasks \cite{wei2022emergent, brown2020language}. % cot的文章Furthermore, since the pre-trained corpus of these large language models (LLMs) contains a huge amount of code tasks, they are also enabled to solve a variety of challenges related to code in software engineering.For example, Feng \emph{et al.}~\cite{feng2023prompting} proposed an automatic technique for accomplishing the bug replay from bug reports through prompt engineering.Deng \emph{et al.}~\cite{deng2023large} proposed a testing tool, using generative and infilling LLMs to generate and mutate various programs for testing the deep learning library.%Xia \emph{et al.}~\cite{xia2023conversation} proposed an approach to generate patches with instant feedback in a conversational style.%Xu \emph{et al.}~\cite{xu2023prompting} proposed a log parsing framework under the in-context inference capability of LLMs.However, there is a lack of understanding of how well these LLMs perform in code clone detection.In our paper, we delve into the potential of leveraging LLMs for detecting code clones.Our hypothesis pivots on the innate ability of LLMs to interpret complex language inputs and generate meaningful outputs. We posit these skills could be harnessed to identify and classify code clones, thus providing a novel approach to a traditional code clone detection problem.Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study to assess the clone detection performance of LLMs like Llama \cite{touvron2023llama}, Alpaca \cite{taori2023alpaca}, Vicuna \cite{zheng2023judging}, StarChat-$\beta$ \cite{Tunstall2023starchat-alpha}, Falcon \cite{almazrouei2023falcon}, MPT \cite{MosaicML2023Introducing}, Llama2 \cite{touvron2023llama2}, Llama2-Chat \cite{touvron2023llama2}, GPT-3.5 \cite{ouyang2022training}, and GPT-4 \cite{openai2023gpt4}. %using different prompt formulations and code embedding similarities.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents a novel approach for code clone detection using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to leverage the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs by providing them with carefully constructed prompts that guide the model to analyze code snippets and determine if they are clones. Specifically, the prompts are designed to have the LLMs examine code from multiple perspectives, such as assessing similarity, identifying clone types, and providing reasoning for their decisions. The prompts are structured to incorporate intermediate reasoning steps (chain-of-thought), which gives models more context than simply asking for a binary yes/no judgement. Additionally, code embedding techniques are explored, where the LLMs encode the code into vector representations which are then compared using cosine similarity. By comprehensively evaluating various prompt formulations, clone types, programming languages and code embeddings, the study provides valuable insights into how large language models can be effectively utilized for clone detection. The overall approach demonstrates that LLMs show promise by harnessing their proficiency in natural language to identify even complex semantic clones.
