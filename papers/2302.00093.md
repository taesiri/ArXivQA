# [Large Language Models Can Be Easily Distracted by Irrelevant Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00093)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. How distractible are large language models when presented with irrelevant context in addition to relevant information for a task? Specifically, how much does adding irrelevant context to arithmetic reasoning problems degrade the performance of various prompting techniques for large language models?2. What strategies can be used to mitigate the distractibility of large language models and improve their robustness to irrelevant context? The paper investigates approaches like self-consistency, adding irrelevant context to prompt examples, and providing explicit instructions to ignore irrelevant information. 3. What factors of the irrelevant context affect the distractibility of large language models the most? The paper analyzes how different types of irrelevant sentences (in-topic vs off-topic, overlapping roles vs non-overlapping roles, in-range vs out-of-range numbers) impact model performance.In summary, the central focus is evaluating the distractibility of large language models when faced with a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, and exploring techniques to improve their robustness in handling irrelevant context. The introduction of the Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC) dataset provides a way to systematically measure distractibility on arithmetic reasoning problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a new benchmark dataset called Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC) to measure the distractibility of large language models when performing arithmetic reasoning. The key points are:- GSM-IC is constructed by adding irrelevant sentences to existing grade-school math problems that are solvable by LLMs. This allows evaluating how irrelevant information in the input affects the model's ability to solve problems.- The authors comprehensively evaluate various state-of-the-art prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, program prompting, etc. on GSM-IC. They find all techniques show significantly degraded performance compared to the original clean datasets, demonstrating LLMs are easily distracted by irrelevant context.- The paper investigates methods to mitigate this weakness, such as using self-consistency, adding irrelevant information to prompt exemplars, and instructing models to ignore irrelevant information. These approaches are shown to improve robustness to irrelevant context to varying degrees. - Detailed analysis is provided on how different types of irrelevant information (in-topic vs off-topic, role name overlap, number range) affect model performance. Factors leading to greater distractibility are identified.In summary, the key contribution is rigorous benchmarking and analysis of LLM distractibility on arithmetic reasoning, and recommendations on training strategies to improve robustness. The authors highlight dealing with irrelevant information as an important direction for future LLM research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC) to measure the distractibility of large language models, and finds that adding irrelevant information significantly degrades model performance on arithmetic reasoning compared to clean datasets, though techniques like self-consistency and instructing the model to ignore irrelevant context can mitigate the issue.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this ICML 2022 example paper and other research on large language models and irrelevant context:- The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC), for specifically testing distractibility of language models. Other work has proposed adversarial datasets through paraphrasing or perturbations, but GSM-IC uniquely adds full irrelevant sentences while keeping original problems intact.- The paper comprehensively evaluates major prompting techniques on the new benchmark, including chain-of-thought prompting, zero-shot prompting, least-to-most prompting, program prompting, and self-consistency. Other work has tended to focus on evaluating one or two methods.- The paper investigates both exemplar-based and instruction-based methods for mitigating distractibility. Showing irrelevant exemplars and providing explicit instructions are novel techniques compared to prior work on adversarial training or robust fine-tuning.- The paper provides an extensive breakdown of how different types of irrelevant information (in-topic vs off-topic, overlapping roles vs non-overlapping roles, in-range vs out-of-range numbers) affect the language models. This provides new analysis into model sensitivities.- The paper extends the evaluation to the DROP reading comprehension dataset as another test case with natural irrelevant context. Evaluating on additional datasets helps generalize the findings.Overall, this paper provides significant new contributions around irrelevant context evaluation and mitigation strategies for language models. The comprehensive benchmark, analysis of prompt techniques, and mitigation approaches help advance research on making language models more robust and less distractible. The key novelty is systematically evaluating distractibility in a controlled way.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Develop training and prompting techniques to further reduce the distractibility of large language models. The authors show that current state-of-the-art models still struggle with ignoring irrelevant context, so improving robustness to irrelevant information should be a priority.- Extend the evaluation of distractibility and irrelevant context to other tasks beyond arithmetic reasoning. The authors introduce the issue in the context of grade school math problems, but suggest examining it more broadly.- Consider distractibility and sensitivity to irrelevant context as an additional dimension when evaluating reasoning capability of language models, in addition to solving challenging problems. The authors argue that reasoning ability should encompass identifying relevant information.- Investigate why certain prompting techniques like least-to-most prompting are less affected by irrelevant context. Understanding this could lead to better prompt design.- Explore whether instructions or demonstrations can further guide language models to ignore irrelevant information. The authors show initial positive results but more work is needed.- Develop better algorithms for using self-consistency to filter out irrelevant context. The authors show it helps but there is room for improvement.- Study the effect of other factors like prompt complexity. The authors find simple prompts can be more robust.In summary, the key directions are developing training and prompting techniques to improve robustness to distraction, evaluating distractibility more extensively across language tasks, and analyzing the factors that contribute to sensitivity to irrelevant context.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC), an arithmetic reasoning dataset derived from GSM8K that contains irrelevant information in the problem descriptions. The authors use GSM-IC to evaluate the distractibility of various prompting techniques with large language models like Codex and GPT-3.5. They find that techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, least-to-most prompting, program prompting, and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting all suffer significant performance drops on GSM-IC compared to the original GSM8K dataset without irrelevant context. Factors like topic, role name overlap, and number range for the irrelevant information impact the degree of distractibility. The authors identify approaches to mitigate distractibility, including using self-consistency, adding irrelevant context to prompt exemplars, and providing an instruction to ignore irrelevant information. These methods lead to improved robustness against irrelevant context while maintaining performance on the original GSM8K dataset. The paper concludes that despite advances on challenging reasoning tasks, language models still have fundamental weaknesses in identifying relevant information that should be addressed in future work.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating the distractibility of large language models when performing arithmetic reasoning. The dataset is based on the GSM8K grade-school math dataset, but adds irrelevant sentences to each problem description that do not change the correct answer. The authors use GSM-IC to evaluate several state-of-the-art prompting techniques with large models like Codex and GPT-3.5. They find that performance substantially degrades on GSM-IC compared to the original GSM8K, showing that these models are easily distracted by irrelevant information. The authors investigate methods to mitigate this weakness, including using self-consistency during decoding and adding explicit instructions to ignore irrelevant information. Both approaches lead to notable gains, though performance still lags behind the original GSM8K. The results indicate fundamental limitations in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, even on problems they can solve perfectly when no irrelevant information is present. The authors encourage developing techniques that not only solve complex reasoning tasks, but are also robust to irrelevant distracting information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC), a new arithmetic reasoning dataset derived from GSM8K by adding irrelevant sentences to the problem descriptions. The goal is to evaluate the distractibility of large language models when solving math problems with irrelevant information. The authors test various prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, least-to-most prompting, and program-based prompting on GSM-IC. They find that the performance of all prompting methods drops significantly compared to on the original GSM8K, showing that large language models are easily distracted by irrelevant contexts. To mitigate this issue, the authors explore approaches like self-consistency decoding and adding natural language instructions to ignore irrelevant information. Both techniques substantially improve the robustness of prompting methods to irrelevant contexts. The paper provides insights into the limitations of large language models in identifying relevant information when solving reasoning tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is evaluating the distractibility and robustness of large language models (LLMs) when solving arithmetic reasoning problems that contain irrelevant information. Specifically, the key questions and goals of the paper seem to be:- How sensitive are LLMs to irrelevant context when doing arithmetic reasoning? Can the presence of even a small amount of irrelevant information significantly degrade the model's performance?- What techniques can help mitigate this limitation and make LLMs more robust to irrelevant context? Can prompting techniques like self-consistency or adding instructions help?- How do different factors of the irrelevant information, like topic, name/role overlap, and number range, affect the model's sensitivity? Which types of irrelevant info are more distracting?To investigate these questions, the authors create a new benchmark called Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context (GSM-IC), which contains math word problems with an added irrelevant sentence. They test various prompting techniques on this benchmark and analyze factors that contribute to the model's distractibility.Overall, the key problem being studied is the distractibility of LLMs when irrelevant context is present, and the robustness of different prompting techniques to such irrelevant noise. The paper aims to demonstrate and measure this limitation, and explore ways to mitigate it.
