# [Network bottlenecks and task structure control the evolution of   interpretable learning rules in a foraging agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13649)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Biological organisms can learn and adapt to their environments, but it is unclear how optimal plasticity mechanisms evolve. Prior work on meta-learning plasticity rules has shown that many different rules can achieve good performance. 
- Little is known about how factors like network structure, constraints, and objectives impact the form of evolved plasticity rules. Understanding these effects could reveal insights into biological learning.

Methods:
- The authors use an evolutionary algorithm to meta-learn reward-modulated plasticity rules in the sensory networks of simple embodied agents performing a foraging task in a 2D environment. 
- The agents have a plastic sensory network that learns to estimate food values, and a motor network that controls movement using the sensory network's outputs.
- They systematically vary factors like the sensory network structure, regularization schemes, weight normalization, and try to uncover commonalities in the resulting plasticity rules.

Key Findings:
- Many different, highly performing plasticity rules can emerge, but regularization helps converge rules into common interpretable forms.  
- Details like the neuronal activation functions and weight normalization impact the specific form of the evolved rule.
- Assumptions made when abstracting the full sensory-motor loop into a simplified static network also affect the evolved rule form.
- Overall, meta-learned plasticity rules are very sensitive to multiple factors. Understanding these dependencies can reveal insights into biological learning objectives and mechanisms.

Contributions:
- Demonstrated evolution of functional reward-modulated plasticity rules in embodied agents.
- Showed how different constraints systematically alter the form of evolved rules.
- Highlighted the difficulty of reverse engineering objectives from biological plasticity mechanisms.
- Proposed using simulations with systematic variations as a methodology to uncover objectives of biological learning rules.
