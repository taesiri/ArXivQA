# [Efficient Multimodal Diffusion Models Using Joint Data Infilling with   Partially Shared U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16488)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new multimodal diffusion model backbone named Partially Shared U-Net (PS-U-Net) and a conditional sampling method called joint infilling for efficient training and flexible inference. PS-U-Net introduces dedicated layers and skip connections for each modality before fusing them, reducing interference while preserving details. Joint infilling allows any partial multimodal conditions during sampling by only modeling the joint distribution during training. This enables new sampling scenarios like conditional generation from partial inputs. Evaluated on MS-COCO, PS-U-Net with joint infilling achieves competitive FID scores compared to state-of-the-art methods while using smaller models. Ablation studies validate that both PS-U-Net and joint infilling contribute to improvements. Additional advantages include up to 3Ã— faster convergence and wider range for text-to-image control. The ideas draw inspiration from neural adaptation and provide more efficient and flexible multimodal generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new multimodal diffusion model backbone architecture called Partially Shared U-Net (PS-U-Net) and an efficient conditional sampling method called joint infilling that enables flexible and efficient multimodal data generation while achieving competitive performance compared to existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new multimodal diffusion backbone architecture named Partially Shared U-Net (PS-U-Net) that introduces dedicated layers and skip connections for each modality before fusing them. This is aimed at reducing interference between modalities during training and improving efficiency. 

2) Introducing a new conditional sampling method called joint infilling that is inspired by image inpainting. This allows flexible partial conditioning during sampling and enables new generation scenarios like joint text and image infilling.

3) Modifying classifier-free guidance into a masked version that works with the joint infilling sampling procedure. This avoids having to explicitly model separate unconditional distributions.

4) Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed PS-U-Net architecture enables faster convergence, better text-to-image generation quality, and allows better control during sampling compared to a baseline U-Net backbone.

5) Showcasing through qualitative and quantitative experiments that the joint ideas lead to improved multimodal generation performance on the MS-COCO dataset with comparable model size.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing a new efficient backbone, sampling method and guidance technique for improving multimodal diffusion models.

The paper proposes a new diffusion model backbone architecture called Partially Shared U-Net (PS-U-Net) and a conditional sampling method called joint infilling for efficient multimodal (text and image) generation. Key ideas include introducing dedicated parameters and skip connections for each modality before fusing into a shared representation, and a flexible sampling method inspired by image inpainting that only requires modeling the joint data distribution. The method is shown to enable efficient training and flexible conditional sampling scenarios compared to prior multimodal diffusion models.
