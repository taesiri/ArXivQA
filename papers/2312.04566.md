# [Gen2Det: Generate to Detect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04566)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Gen2Det, a modular pipeline to generate synthetic training data for object detection using state-of-the-art grounded image generation diffusion models. Unlike prior works that paste object instances onto images, Gen2Det directly generates full scene-centric images conditioned on object bounding boxes and labels. To handle imperfections in the generated data, Gen2Det applies image-level and instance-level filtering, as well as modified training techniques like sampling real/synthetic batches and ignoring background regions in synthetic images during loss computation. Experiments across datasets and architectures demonstrate consistent improvements from Gen2Det, especially on rare classes and in low-data regimes. For example, on the long-tailed LVIS dataset, Gen2Det improves AP by 2.13 boxes and 1.84 masks over vanilla training, with much larger AP gains on rare classes. The modular nature of Gen2Det allows it to benefit from future advances in generation models and object detectors. In summary, Gen2Det provides an effective pipeline to utilize synthetic data for boosted detection performance.
