# [Contextual Fusion For Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09526)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be whether a biologically-inspired multimodal fusion approach can improve the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. Specifically, the authors explore whether combining object-centric (foreground) and scene-centric (background) features can help defend against different types of adversarial attacks, without compromising performance on clean images. The key hypotheses seem to be:

- Adversarial attacks may have divergent effects on foreground vs background feature representations. 

- Utilizing a combination of modalities (foreground + background) can potentially make image classification more robust to adversarial perturbations.

- Background (contextual) features may provide additional useful information to complement the object-oriented foreground, and help improve classification, especially under adversarial attack. 

The authors test these hypotheses by developing foreground, background and joint classifiers, and evaluating their performance on blurred and adversarial images from the MS COCO and CIFAR-10 datasets. Their goal is to demonstrate the potential benefits of multimodal fusion for adversarial robustness, inspired by the brain's ability to integrate diverse sensory streams.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a novel method for improving adversarial robustness of image classifiers by fusing foreground (object-focused) and background (context-focused) features extracted using two separate CNNs. 

- Demonstrating that adversarial attacks have divergent effects on the foreground and background feature spaces. Blurring the foreground objects shifts the foreground feature space but leaves the background feature space intact.

- Showing that combining foreground and background features via late fusion improves robustness to Gaussian blur perturbations applied to the foreground, especially when the contexts are more variable (dissimilar contexts).

- Demonstrating that the proposed fusion method improves robustness against gradient-based FGSM attacks for the MS COCO dataset, without decreasing performance on clean images or requiring adversarial training. The benefit depends on both modalities contributing equally to the joint classifier.

- Introducing a regularization method to bias the joint classifier towards the more robust background features when the foreground is known to be attacked. This outperforms standard adversarial training.

- Proposing that integrating multimodal contextual information, inspired by biological sensory processing, can improve adversarial robustness in a complementary way to existing defenses.

In summary, the key innovation is using distinct foreground and background modalities to create a fused representation that is more robust to perturbations than a single modality classifier. This biologically-inspired approach does not require adversarial training or compromise clean image accuracy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using a combination of foreground object features and background scene features extracted from different convolutional neural networks as a way to improve adversarial robustness of image classifiers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on improving adversarial robustness of deep neural networks:

- The main novelty is using multimodal fusion of foreground (object-focused) and background (context-focused) features to improve robustness. Most prior work has focused on unimodal approaches applied to the object/foreground pathway. 

- Showing that background features are less affected by adversarial perturbations targeted at foreground is an important insight. This helps explain why fusion can improve robustness.

- Evaluating robustness on both imperceptible (FGSM) and human-perceivable (blur) perturbations is more thorough than many papers that focus on one type.

- Testing on both synthetic (CIFAR) and real-world (COCO) datasets also provides more convincing evidence. Many papers only use one dataset.

- The regularization approach to bias fusion is novel and shows better performance than standard adversarial training. Most papers only compare to undefended models.

- The biological motivation from human/animal multisensory perception provides an interesting perspective. However, the fusion model used is still rather simple compared to biology.

- The scale of experiments is relatively small compared to some state-of-the-art work, using subsets of COCO and CIFAR. Testing on larger benchmarks like ImageNet would further validate claims.

Overall, I think the idea of using multimodal fusion to improve adversarial robustness is innovative and promising. The experiments convincingly demonstrate benefits on multiple datasets and perturbations. More work is still needed to scale up and refine the fusion approaches for greater impact compared to other defense strategies. But this is an encouraging start pointing in a useful new research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Test the fusion approach on other modalities beyond visual foreground/background (e.g. auditory, text). The authors state that their approach can be easily scaled by adding other richer contexts and modalities. 

- Implement more sophisticated fusion layers than just concatenation, inspired by neuroscientific principles like recurrent networks. The authors suggest recurrent memory networks that better approximate associative cortex in the brain may be more efficient at balancing contribution of different modalities.

- Explore more distinct modalities for fusion, as they found success depended on variability/distinctness of contexts. Using more distinct modalities could enhance performance on metrics like classification accuracy against adversarial attacks.

- Use their fusion approach in a complementary way with other techniques like adversarial regularization to improve robustness to attacks. They propose their method provides a new way to improve robustness that can complement current state-of-the-art approaches.

- Further investigate how biological networks extract knowledge from experience and create internal models of the world. The authors suggest their work may provide insights into how the brain combines information streams to create a rich internal model.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the fusion approach to other modalities and datasets, using more sophisticated fusion mechanisms, combining with other adversarial defense methods, and further exploring the neuroscientific principles underlying multimodal fusion.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using multimodal fusion of foreground (object) and background (context) image features to improve adversarial robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors train separate CNNs on object-centric (Imagenet) and scene-centric (Places365) datasets to extract foreground and background features. They show blurring the foreground object shifts the foreground feature space but not the background space. A late fusion CNN combining foreground and background features outperforms foreground-only models on blurred and gradient-based (FGSM) adversarial examples, especially when objects have distinct contexts. Regularizing foreground weights allows biasing the fusion to prefer context over compromised foreground features. The multimodal fusion approach improves robustness without hurting clean image accuracy or requiring adversarial retraining. The authors propose this bio-inspired multimodal integration provides a new way to improve adversarial robustness complementary to other state-of-the-art defenses.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using multimodal fusion of foreground (object) and background (contextual) features to improve adversarial robustness in image classifiers. The authors train separate Resnet classifiers on Imagenet (foreground) and Places365 (background), and fuse the features from these networks into a joint classifier. They test the joint classifier on blurred and adversarially perturbed images from COCO and CIFAR datasets. Blurring mainly affects the foreground features while leaving background features intact. The joint classifier outperforms the foreground classifier on blurred images, with bigger improvements when objects have more distinct contexts. On gradient-based adversarial attacks, the joint classifier maintains accuracy better than the foreground classifier for COCO images where the background provides useful context, but not for CIFAR where background is less informative. Regularizing the foreground weights allows the joint classifier to rely more on contextual features when the foreground is attacked. Overall, fusing distinct modalities can improve robustness to perturbations targeting one modality, without compromising accuracy on clean images. The authors propose this biologically-inspired multimodal integration as a promising approach to enhance adversarial robustness.

In summary, this paper shows that fusing object and contextual features from separate networks trained on different datasets can improve classifier robustness to various perturbations, especially when the context provides meaningful information. The authors suggest this multimodal fusion approach is analogous to cortical processing in biological systems, and may provide insights into developing more robust machine learning models. Key results demonstrate maintaining accuracy on adversarially perturbed images without decreasing performance on clean images or needing adversarial retraining.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper describes a fusion model using a combination of background and foreground features extracted in parallel from Places-CNN and Imagenet-CNN. The model has three components:

1) A foreground classifier trained on Imagenet to extract object-centric features. 

2) A background classifier trained on Places365 to extract scene-centric features.

3) A joint classifier that concatenates the features from 1) and 2) to create a fused representation. 

The fused model is evaluated on preserving adversarial robustness against human perceivable (e.g. Gaussian blur) and network perceivable (e.g. FGSM) attacks using the CIFAR-10 and MS COCO datasets. The results show that fusion allows for improvements in classification without decreasing performance on clean images or needing adversarial retraining. The model also demonstrates better robustness to Gaussian blur perturbations. The benefits depend on the variability in image contexts, with larger gains for classes with more distinct contexts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of adversarial attacks on deep neural networks and proposing a new method to improve robustness against such attacks. Specifically:

- The paper points out that deep neural networks are often susceptible to small perturbations of inputs that can cause misclassification, known as adversarial attacks. 

- It notes that current defense methods against adversarial attacks often have limitations, like not generalizing across attack types or reducing accuracy on clean examples.

- The paper proposes a new approach to improve adversarial robustness inspired by multimodal integration in biological brains, which combines inputs from different "modalities" like vision, audio, etc. 

- The key idea is to extract both foreground (object) and background (context) features from images in parallel using two CNNs, and then fuse them to get a joint representation for classification.

- The hypothesis is that adversarial attacks tend to mainly affect one modality (e.g. foreground), so fusion with other modalities (e.g. background) can compensate and improve robustness.

- The paper tests this on image datasets using gaussian blurring and gradient-based attacks, showing improved performance from fusion compared to individual models.

In summary, the paper introduces a biologically-inspired fusion approach to improve adversarial robustness in deep neural networks by integrating both foreground and background information from images.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores a biologically-inspired approach to improve the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks by fusing multiple data modalities. The authors develop three classifiers for image data: a foreground classifier trained on Imagenet to extract object features, a background classifier trained on Places365 to extract scene context, and a joint classifier fusing both streams. They show that adversarial blur attacks affect the foreground and background classifiers differently, with the foreground features shifting entirely while the background remains stable. Testing on blurred MS COCO images shows the joint classifier outperforms the foreground classifier, especially when object classes have distinct contexts. For gradient-based FGSM attacks on MS COCO, the joint classifier retains accuracy better than the foreground classifier and matches its clean image accuracy, with balanced weights between streams. On CIFAR-10, the fusion model does not help against FGSM since the backgrounds lack variability. Regularizing to bias the fused model toward background features significantly improves robustness over standard adversarial training. The paper demonstrates multimodal fusion as a promising approach to enhance adversarial robustness without compromising accuracy, especially when modalities provide distinct, meaningful information. The method aligns with biological principles and could provide insights for improving machine learning algorithms.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores using a fusion of foreground (object) and background (context) image features to improve the robustness of image classifiers against adversarial attacks. The authors train separate Resnet18 classifiers on Imagenet (foreground) and Places365 (background), and fuse the features from these networks to create a joint classifier. They test the joint classifier on blurred and gradient-based adversarial examples, and find that it is more robust than using either foreground or background features alone, especially when the contexts across object classes are more distinct. The joint classifier leverages complementary information in the foreground and background streams to maintain accuracy under attack. Its performance can be further improved by regularizing the foreground stream weights when the adversary is known, allowing the background stream to dominate. Overall, this biologically-inspired approach of fusing distinct modalities provides a way to enhance adversarial robustness without compromising accuracy on clean images or requiring adversarial retraining.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a fusion of foreground (object) and background (context) features for improving adversarial robustness. What are some other modalities besides visual that could be incorporated in the fusion model to further improve robustness? For example, could text annotations or auditory information be useful additional modalities?

2. The authors use a late fusion strategy, concatenating foreground and background features before the fully connected layer. What are some alternative fusion techniques that could potentially work better, such as early or hybrid fusion? How might the optimal fusion strategy depend on the specific modalities being combined?

3. For the blur experiments, blur was only applied to the foreground objects. How would results differ if blur was applied to the entire image instead? Would the background classifier still be resistant to blur in that case? 

4. The improvements from fusion were larger when test images had more variability in context (the dissimilar dataset). What are some ways to quantify context variability in a dataset? Are there other dataset statistics besides variability that might predict when fusion will help more?

5. The paper shows different attacks can affect foreground and background representations differently. Are there other kinds of targeted attacks besides blur that could be used to probe this? For example, could you design an attack that specifically targets background features? 

6. The regularization approach biased the model towards background features when the foreground was attacked. Could this same approach work in reverse, regularizing background weights if the background is attacked instead? How does it compare to standard adversarial training?

7. For the CIFAR-10 experiments, fusion did not help much with gradient attacks. Are there changes to the training procedure or architecture you could use to make fusion more effective for CIFAR-10?

8. How sensitive are the results to the specific foreground and background architectures used? Would other networks besides ResNet18 trained on ImageNet and Places work as well?

9. The paper mentions recurrent networks as an alternative fusion technique. How could RNNs or LSTMs potentially help learn fused representations that are more robust? What are the challenges to training them effectively?

10. The method improves robustness without adversarial retraining. Could it be combined with adversarial retraining to achieve even greater robustness? How would the regularization approach compare if models are adversarially trained?
