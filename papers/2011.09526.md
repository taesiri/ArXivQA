# [Contextual Fusion For Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09526)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be whether a biologically-inspired multimodal fusion approach can improve the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. Specifically, the authors explore whether combining object-centric (foreground) and scene-centric (background) features can help defend against different types of adversarial attacks, without compromising performance on clean images. The key hypotheses seem to be:- Adversarial attacks may have divergent effects on foreground vs background feature representations. - Utilizing a combination of modalities (foreground + background) can potentially make image classification more robust to adversarial perturbations.- Background (contextual) features may provide additional useful information to complement the object-oriented foreground, and help improve classification, especially under adversarial attack. The authors test these hypotheses by developing foreground, background and joint classifiers, and evaluating their performance on blurred and adversarial images from the MS COCO and CIFAR-10 datasets. Their goal is to demonstrate the potential benefits of multimodal fusion for adversarial robustness, inspired by the brain's ability to integrate diverse sensory streams.
