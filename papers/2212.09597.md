# Reasoning with Language Model Prompting: A Survey

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can language models be prompted to perform complex reasoning and exhibit enhanced reasoning abilities?The paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent research on using language model prompting strategies to confer reasoning abilities to language models. The key focus is on examining the methods that have been proposed to prompt large language models to demonstrate skills like mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, logical reasoning etc.The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully engineering prompts and providing relevant knowledge through the prompts, language models can be induced to generate coherent reasoning chains and solve problems that require complex multi-step reasoning. The paper categorizes and reviews a variety of prompting strategies aimed at enhancing reasoning in language models.So in summary, the central research direction is how prompting techniques can unlock and improve reasoning capabilities in large pre-trained language models. The paper surveys the prompting methods, compares them, and provides insights into this rapidly evolving research area.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:- It provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of recent work on reasoning with language model prompting. The paper categorizes methods into two main branches: strategy enhanced reasoning and knowledge enhanced reasoning. - It gives detailed comparisons and analysis of different methods, focusing on aspects like the language models used, how prompts are acquired, and training scenarios. For example, the paper finds that chain-of-thought prompting shows much greater performance gains on larger language models.- The paper highlights trends and empirical findings from analyzing recent work, such as the strong reasoning performance of models pretrained on code. It also discusses potential reasons for the emergence of reasoning abilities in language models.- The paper introduces benchmarks, datasets, and open resources to facilitate future research in this area. It discusses the characteristics of different reasoning tasks like arithmetic, commonsense, logical, etc.- The paper concludes by outlining limitations of current methods and proposing future research directions, including developing more efficient reasoning models, achieving robust and interpretable reasoning, and exploring multimodal and interactive reasoning.In summary, the key contribution is providing a systematic organization and review of the fast-growing research area of reasoning with language model prompting. The comparisons, analyses, and resources aim to inspire new ideas and bring clarity to this important subfield of NLP.
