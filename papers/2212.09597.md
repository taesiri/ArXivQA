# Reasoning with Language Model Prompting: A Survey

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can language models be prompted to perform complex reasoning and exhibit enhanced reasoning abilities?The paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent research on using language model prompting strategies to confer reasoning abilities to language models. The key focus is on examining the methods that have been proposed to prompt large language models to demonstrate skills like mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, logical reasoning etc.The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully engineering prompts and providing relevant knowledge through the prompts, language models can be induced to generate coherent reasoning chains and solve problems that require complex multi-step reasoning. The paper categorizes and reviews a variety of prompting strategies aimed at enhancing reasoning in language models.So in summary, the central research direction is how prompting techniques can unlock and improve reasoning capabilities in large pre-trained language models. The paper surveys the prompting methods, compares them, and provides insights into this rapidly evolving research area.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other similar research:- Scope: This paper provides a broad survey of recent work on reasoning with language model prompting across different methods, tasks, and knowledge sources. Other surveys have tended to focus on specific subareas like in-context learning, mathematical reasoning, or tool use. - Comprehensiveness: The authors organize and summarize a large number of papers on prompting-based reasoning, providing useful taxonomies and comparisons. Other surveys in this space have covered fewer papers in less depth.- Analysis: In addition to summarizing methods, this survey offers analysis and discussion comparing model scales, prompt types, knowledge sources, etc. It provides insights into why certain techniques work and when they apply. Other surveys are more descriptive.- Resources: This survey helpfully compiles benchmarks, datasets, code libraries, and other resources for reasoning with prompts. Other surveys do not always include such practical information for researchers.- Recency: As a 2023 paper, this survey covers very recent work through early 2022. Many prompts papers were published in 2022, so this timely survey includes cutting-edge approaches not covered by older surveys.- Perspective: The authors provide interesting speculations on future directions and limitations. Other surveys simply summarize existing work without such forward-thinking analysis.So in summary, this paper stands out for its comprehensive and analytical treatment of the latest work in reasoning via prompting. It not only surveys the field, but provides useful insights to guide future research. The comparisons and resources are particularly valuable contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several potential future research directions in the paper, including:- Understanding the theoretical principles behind language models' reasoning abilities. They suggest this could involve exploring connections between code, structured data, and reasoning, as well as drawing inspiration from other fields like physics, cognitive science, and neuroscience.- Developing more efficient reasoning methods that use smaller LMs or other techniques to reduce computational costs and carbon emissions. Ideas include model cascades, knowledge distillation, retrieval augmentation, model editing, and delta tuning.- Improving the robustness, faithfulness, and interpretability of reasoning through methods like probabilistic programs, neural-symbolic approaches, and human feedback.- Expanding to multimodal and interactive reasoning by incorporating information beyond just text, like images, audio, and video. This could involve unified multimodal models or chaining together specialized models.- Enhancing generalization and transfer of reasoning abilities to new tasks and scenarios. This may connect to analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, and compositional reasoning.- Developing more comprehensive evaluations and benchmarks to measure diverse reasoning skills and model capabilities. This includes drawing from cognitive science and other AI subfields.Overall, the authors call for combining insights across disciplines like NLP, neuroscience, psychology, etc. to understand reasoning and build more human-like AI systems, rather than just scaling up models. They envision language prompting models contributing more robust reasoning abilities in the future.
