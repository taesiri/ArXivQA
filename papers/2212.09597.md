## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent progress on reasoning with language model prompting. It first introduces the preliminaries of reasoning with LM prompting, including the standard prompting formulation and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The paper then categorizes existing methods into two branches: strategy enhanced reasoning and knowledge enhanced reasoning. Strategy enhanced reasoning methods aim to optimize the reasoning strategy, including prompt engineering (single-stage and multi-stage), process optimization (self, ensemble, and iterative), and leveraging external engines. Knowledge enhanced reasoning methods prompt LMs with implicit or explicit knowledge to assist reasoning. The paper also discusses benchmarks for evaluating reasoning, highlights open resources, compares different methods, and suggests future research directions like studying the theoretical principle of reasoning with prompting, developing efficient and robust reasoning, and exploring multimodal interactive reasoning. Overall, the paper systematically reviews the cutting-edge research on reasoning with LM prompting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent progress in reasoning with language model prompting. It organizes existing works into two main categories - Strategy Enhanced Reasoning and Knowledge Enhanced Reasoning. 

Strategy Enhanced Reasoning methods aim to improve the reasoning strategy, through techniques like prompt engineering, process optimization, and external engines. Prompt engineering focuses on constructing high-quality prompts, either in a single-stage or multi-stage manner. Process optimization calibrates the reasoning process via self-optimization, ensemble-optimization, or iterative-optimization. External engines incorporate physical simulators, code interpreters, or tool learning to assist language models. Knowledge Enhanced Reasoning methods prompt language models with implicit or explicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge refers to the internal knowledge within language models that can be extracted via generative prompting. Explicit knowledge is external structured knowledge that can be retrieved to augment prompts. The paper also provides benchmark tasks, open resources, comparisons between methods, and promising future research directions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper surveys recent work on improving reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the use of prompting strategies.
