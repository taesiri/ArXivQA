## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other similar research:- Scope: This paper provides a broad survey of recent work on reasoning with language model prompting across different methods, tasks, and knowledge sources. Other surveys have tended to focus on specific subareas like in-context learning, mathematical reasoning, or tool use. - Comprehensiveness: The authors organize and summarize a large number of papers on prompting-based reasoning, providing useful taxonomies and comparisons. Other surveys in this space have covered fewer papers in less depth.- Analysis: In addition to summarizing methods, this survey offers analysis and discussion comparing model scales, prompt types, knowledge sources, etc. It provides insights into why certain techniques work and when they apply. Other surveys are more descriptive.- Resources: This survey helpfully compiles benchmarks, datasets, code libraries, and other resources for reasoning with prompts. Other surveys do not always include such practical information for researchers.- Recency: As a 2023 paper, this survey covers very recent work through early 2022. Many prompts papers were published in 2022, so this timely survey includes cutting-edge approaches not covered by older surveys.- Perspective: The authors provide interesting speculations on future directions and limitations. Other surveys simply summarize existing work without such forward-thinking analysis.So in summary, this paper stands out for its comprehensive and analytical treatment of the latest work in reasoning via prompting. It not only surveys the field, but provides useful insights to guide future research. The comparisons and resources are particularly valuable contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several potential future research directions in the paper, including:- Understanding the theoretical principles behind language models' reasoning abilities. They suggest this could involve exploring connections between code, structured data, and reasoning, as well as drawing inspiration from other fields like physics, cognitive science, and neuroscience.- Developing more efficient reasoning methods that use smaller LMs or other techniques to reduce computational costs and carbon emissions. Ideas include model cascades, knowledge distillation, retrieval augmentation, model editing, and delta tuning.- Improving the robustness, faithfulness, and interpretability of reasoning through methods like probabilistic programs, neural-symbolic approaches, and human feedback.- Expanding to multimodal and interactive reasoning by incorporating information beyond just text, like images, audio, and video. This could involve unified multimodal models or chaining together specialized models.- Enhancing generalization and transfer of reasoning abilities to new tasks and scenarios. This may connect to analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, and compositional reasoning.- Developing more comprehensive evaluations and benchmarks to measure diverse reasoning skills and model capabilities. This includes drawing from cognitive science and other AI subfields.Overall, the authors call for combining insights across disciplines like NLP, neuroscience, psychology, etc. to understand reasoning and build more human-like AI systems, rather than just scaling up models. They envision language prompting models contributing more robust reasoning abilities in the future.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent progress on reasoning with language model prompting. It first introduces the preliminaries of reasoning with LM prompting, including the standard prompting formulation and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The paper then categorizes existing methods into two branches: strategy enhanced reasoning and knowledge enhanced reasoning. Strategy enhanced reasoning methods aim to optimize the reasoning strategy, including prompt engineering (single-stage and multi-stage), process optimization (self, ensemble, and iterative), and leveraging external engines. Knowledge enhanced reasoning methods prompt LMs with implicit or explicit knowledge to assist reasoning. The paper also discusses benchmarks for evaluating reasoning, highlights open resources, compares different methods, and suggests future research directions like studying the theoretical principle of reasoning with prompting, developing efficient and robust reasoning, and exploring multimodal interactive reasoning. Overall, the paper systematically reviews the cutting-edge research on reasoning with LM prompting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent progress in reasoning with language model prompting. It organizes existing works into two main categories - Strategy Enhanced Reasoning and Knowledge Enhanced Reasoning. Strategy Enhanced Reasoning methods aim to improve the reasoning strategy, through techniques like prompt engineering, process optimization, and external engines. Prompt engineering focuses on constructing high-quality prompts, either in a single-stage or multi-stage manner. Process optimization calibrates the reasoning process via self-optimization, ensemble-optimization, or iterative-optimization. External engines incorporate physical simulators, code interpreters, or tool learning to assist language models. Knowledge Enhanced Reasoning methods prompt language models with implicit or explicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge refers to the internal knowledge within language models that can be extracted via generative prompting. Explicit knowledge is external structured knowledge that can be retrieved to augment prompts. The paper also provides benchmark tasks, open resources, comparisons between methods, and promising future research directions.
