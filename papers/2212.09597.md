# Reasoning with Language Model Prompting: A Survey

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can language models be prompted to perform complex reasoning and exhibit enhanced reasoning abilities?The paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent research on using language model prompting strategies to confer reasoning abilities to language models. The key focus is on examining the methods that have been proposed to prompt large language models to demonstrate skills like mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, logical reasoning etc.The main hypothesis seems to be that by carefully engineering prompts and providing relevant knowledge through the prompts, language models can be induced to generate coherent reasoning chains and solve problems that require complex multi-step reasoning. The paper categorizes and reviews a variety of prompting strategies aimed at enhancing reasoning in language models.So in summary, the central research direction is how prompting techniques can unlock and improve reasoning capabilities in large pre-trained language models. The paper surveys the prompting methods, compares them, and provides insights into this rapidly evolving research area.
