# [Graph Information Bottleneck for Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02545)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a simple contrastive vision graph neural network (SC-ViG) for remote sensing image segmentation. The key ideas are: 1) Model images as graphs instead of grids or sequences to better capture irregular objects; 2) Introduce an adaptive node/edge masking approach during contrastive learning to improve representation ability rather than random masking; 3) Apply information bottleneck theory to eliminate redundant information during graph contrastive learning while preserving task-relevant information. Specifically, images are divided into patches and modeled as graphs. The convolutional blocks in UNet are replaced with graph convolution blocks using multi-head attention for capturing positional information. An adaptive node/edge masking strategy is proposed for graph contrastive learning that is jointly optimized for the segmentation task. Additionally, information bottleneck theory is incorporated to maximize mutual information between the views related to the task while minimizing unrelated redundant information. Experiments on four remote sensing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing the effectiveness of flexible graph representations and the information bottleneck approach for graph contrastive representation learning.
