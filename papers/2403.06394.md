# [FSViewFusion: Few-Shots View Generation of Novel Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Novel view synthesis has seen great progress with neural radiance fields (NeRFs). However, NeRFs overfit to a single scene and lack generalization to novel objects. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for generalization in view synthesis, but rely on 3D priors like camera poses. The paper explores if diffusion models can induce a 3D understanding of a scene without explicit 3D supervision.

Key Ideas:
- Views can be high-level concepts that diffusion models can disentangle from object identity with a few samples. 
- A view concept can be learned from a single image and transferred to novel objects.
- The paper proposes a 3-stage training strategy called FSViewFusion:
   1) Learn view concept with a low-rank adapter (LoRA) from 1 image 
   2) Learn novel object concept with another LoRA from 3-4 images
   3) Merge view and object LoRAs to generate novel views

Contributions:
- Provides empirical evidence that views are high-level concepts that can be learned by diffusion models
- Designed a learning strategy to disentangle and transfer view concepts to novel objects with few shots
- Operates on only 1 view sample and 3-4 object samples, avoiding extensive multi-view pretraining
- Extensive experiments show it generates reliable views for in-the-wild images and benchmarks well on DTU dataset
- Qualitative results also show it can transfer views between structurally different objects

Limitations:
- Cannot smoothly interpolate views
- Needs one LoRA per view for best performance 

The paper makes a case for rethinking novel view synthesis as learning and transferring high-level view concepts with diffusion models, instead of relying on 3D supervision. With very few samples, FSViewFusion can disentangle and recombine view and object concepts for generating novel views of real images.
