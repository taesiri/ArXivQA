## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the paper, some of the key terms and topics that appear relevant are:

- Financial statements (balance sheet, cash flow statement, etc.)
- Accounting policies 
- Revenue recognition
- Goodwill and intangible assets
- Stock-based compensation
- Retirement benefits
- Debt and financing
- Segment reporting
- Financial instruments

The paper discusses Kellogg Company's financial results, accounting policies, balance sheet items, cash flows, debt and equity financing, treatment of things like goodwill and intangibles, employee benefits, use of financial instruments like derivatives, and segment financial data. So these seem to be some of the main financial reporting concepts covered in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the methodology presented in this paper:

1. You stated that your model incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.8% in the US model and 70% of the global benefit plan assets. What were the key factors in arriving at this inflation estimate? How sensitive is your valuation model to this inflation estimate? 

2. In discussing your approach to estimate expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, you mention using rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Can you elaborate more on the forward-looking methods and what specific market indicators you analyze?

3. On page 20, you note that differences between assumed and actual experience can impact the classification of cash tax benefits related to stock options. Can you walk through an example of how a difference in actual stock price volatility versus your assumed volatility would impact the cash flow presentation?

4. You utilize both a lattice-based and Black-Scholes model to value your equity compensation awards. What are the key reasons you chose a lattice model for your annual grants and Black-Scholes for reload grants? How do the results differ in valuation?

5. On page 22, you state "We periodically engage third-party valuation consultants to assist in this process." In what specific instances have you relied on third-party valuations and what value do they add versus internal assessments?  

6. In testing goodwill and intangibles for impairment, what are the 2-3 key assumptions or judgments you focus most on in your discounted cash flow analysis? How have these changed over the last 3 years?

7. Your weighted average discount rate declined from 2005 to 2006. Given rising interest rates, what were the factors causing the decline? How much of an impact did your new European legal structure have?

8. On page 25 you note unrecognized tax benefits dropped $25M related to audit closures. What is your process for estimating reserves and how frequently do you review them? What key factors drove the change?

9. In your segment analysis on page 55, what are the key factors causing the lower returns in Europe? Given the high goodwill and intangibles, is there risk of future impairment?

10. Inventory balances rose in 2006 - what initiatives are you taking to improve inventory management and bring levels back in line? What role has rising commodity costs had?
