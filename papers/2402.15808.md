# [Optimal Zero-Shot Detector for Multi-Armed Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Considers a scenario where a malicious attacker can intercept and perturb input signals (e.g. images) before they reach a target classifier (channel) using multiple attack strategies simultaneously (multi-armed attack)
- Goal is to detect if inputs have been adversarially perturbed without access to the channel or new/training data, relying only on existing "off-the-shelf" detectors

Proposed Solution:  
- Formulates the problem as minimax optimization to find optimal way to aggregate decisions from available detectors 
- Derives optimal soft-detector that aggregates detector decisions by maximizing mutual information between the detector index and prediction variable
- Proposes a practical detection method by thresholding aggregated soft prediction  

Key Contributions:
1) Formalizes multi-armed attack detection problem in zero-shot setting as minimax optimization
2) Characterizes theoretically optimal soft-detector for aggregating decisions of available detectors 
3) Evaluates empirically on image classifiers, showing proposed aggregation consistently improves detection over individual detectors and state-of-the-art methods, even in non-optimal settings

The solution does not require new labeled data or access to retrain the target classifier. It provides a flexible way to combine existing or future detectors in a sound mathematical framework. Experiments highlight effectiveness even when assumptions deviate from theoretical optimum.
