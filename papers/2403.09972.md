# [Think Twice Before Assure: Confidence Estimation for Large Language   Models through Reflection on Multiple Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from overconfidence in their generated answers, assigning high confidence scores even to incorrect answers. This causes miscalibration between confidence scores and answer accuracy.
- Existing methods addressing LLM overconfidence have a key limitation - they only consider confidence estimation for a single LLM-generated answer, while the LLM can still be biased towards that answer.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduces a new paradigm that evaluates multiple candidate answers to mitigate overconfidence on the target answer. Comparing trustability of answers helps reduce biased trust in incorrect ones.
- Proposes a two-step "Think Twice Before Assure (TTA)" framework:
   1) Instruct LLM to reflect and justify potential correctness of each answer.
   2) Aggregate justifications to derive confidence score for target answer.
- TTA can be combined with existing methods like prompt ensemble for further improvements.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a new multi-answer evaluation paradigm to address limitations of existing paradigms for LLM confidence estimation. 
- Presents the TTA framework to implement this paradigm with reflection and justification on multiple answers.
- Shows improved calibration over existing methods on 3 tasks. TTA also combines with other methods for further gains.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel paradigm and TTA framework that leverages comparison of multiple answers to mitigate overconfidence of LLMs for better calibrated confidence estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new confidence estimation framework called "Think Twice Before Assure" that mitigates overconfidence in language models by having them reflect on and justify the correctness of multiple candidate answers before estimating confidence on the target answer.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new confidence estimation paradigm and framework called "Think Twice Before Assure" (TTA) to mitigate the overconfidence issue in language models. Specifically:

1) It introduces a novel paradigm that evaluates the trustability of multiple candidate answers to reduce the biased trust in any single incorrect answer generated by the language model. 

2) It presents the TTA framework with two steps - first instructing the language model to reflect and justify the potential correctness of each answer, and then aggregating these justifications to derive a more refined confidence score for the target answer.

3) Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the TTA framework in improving calibration performance over existing methods. It also shows TTA can flexibly combine with other methods for further improvements.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the multi-answer evaluation paradigm and TTA framework to tackle language model overconfidence for more calibrated confidence estimation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Confidence estimation - The paper focuses on confidence estimation for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the trustability of their outputs. This is a core concept.

- Overconfidence - The paper aims to address the overconfidence issue in LLMs where they assign high confidence to incorrect answers. Mitigating overconfidence is a key goal. 

- Calibration - Well-calibrated confidence estimation that aligns confidence scores with answer accuracy is the objective. Calibration is used as an evaluation metric.

- Multi-answer evaluation - The paper proposes evaluating multiple candidate answers instead of just the target answer to reduce overconfidence. This is a key idea introduced. 

- Reflection and justification - The proposed TTA framework has LLMs reflect on and justify the trustability of each answer before joint confidence estimation.

- Black-box API LLMs - The paper focuses specifically on confidence estimation for black-box API access large language models.

In summary, the key terms cover confidence estimation, overconfidence, calibration, multi-answer evaluation, reflection/justification, and black-box LLMs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new multi-answer evaluation paradigm for confidence estimation. How does considering multiple candidate answers help mitigate the overconfidence issue compared to existing paradigms that focus on a single target answer? 

2. The two key considerations in arriving at the proposed paradigm are outlined. Can you explain these two considerations in detail and why they are important?

3. The paper presents a two-step TTA framework to implement the proposed paradigm. Can you walk through the two steps in detail and explain the rationale behind each one? 

4. In the first step of TTA, LLM is instructed to generate justifications regarding the potential correctness of each answer. Why is it important to gather these justifications from an abductive perspective rather than simply asking LLM to evaluate the target answer?

5. The paper chooses to use the Top-K verbalized method in the second step of TTA for joint confidence estimation. What is the rationale behind this choice compared to simply averaging separate confidence scores?  

6. The order shuffling of justifications in the Top-K verbalized prompt is noted to improve calibration. Why does this help mitigate position bias in the justifications? Can you think of any other techniques to reduce this bias?

7. The flexibility of TTA to combine with existing methods is shown. What is an example combination and how does it lead to further improved calibration over TTA alone?

8. In analyzing the effect on bias mitigation, clearer separation of confidence scores between correct and incorrect answers is observed. How does this translate to improved selective prediction capabilities?

9. When evaluating on different target answers from LLM sampling, a sharp decrease in calibration for TTA on CommonsenseQA is noticed. What could be the potential reasons behind this?

10. The parameter sensitivity analysis reveals that sufficient numbers of both justifications and guesses are important for good TTA performance. Can you explain why this is the case?
