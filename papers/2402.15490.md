## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become integral to many deep learning applications, especially computer vision. However, the rapid innovation in CNN architectures makes it challenging for researchers to stay abreast of advancements and select the most appropriate techniques for their needs. Prior surveys lack a clear taxonomy to classify CNN variants, give incomplete coverage beyond a few years back, and do not analyze tradeoffs like accuracy vs efficiency in depth.  

Solution:
This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy and survey of convolutional neural networks in deep learning. It proposes classifying CNN architectures along multiple intrinsic attributes like dimensionality and efficiency. The authors provide detailed coverage from basic CNN building blocks to recent innovations in CNN design spanning from 2012 to 2023. 

The survey is structured into 10 logical sections. After introducing fundamentals of convolutions and CNN basics, it explores major convolution types like 2D, 1D, 3D, dilated, grouped, and depthwise separable. Advanced techniques covered include spatial pyramid pooling, capsule networks, attention mechanisms, and neural architecture search among others. Real-world applications across vision, NLP, audio, and medical imaging showcase convolution utility.

Key focus areas are elucidating accuracy vs efficiency tradeoffs, model compression methods, hardware considerations, benchmarking using standard datasets, software frameworks for development, and assessing future research directions. An explicit goal is helping readers select appropriate architectures and understand intrinsic tradeoffs for target applications given constraints.

Contributions:

- Comprehensive analysis spanning diverse CNN innovations useful for both new and experienced researchers
- Purpose-built taxonomy to classify architectures by core attributes
