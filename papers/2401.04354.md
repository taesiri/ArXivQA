# [Knowledge-enhanced Multi-perspective Video Representation Learning for   Scene Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04354)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- With explosive growth of video data, learning comprehensive video representations is important for video analytics tasks like scene recognition. 
- Scene recognition from videos is challenging due to diversity and complexity of video contents.
- Existing works either focus only on temporal information from videos or only recognize scenes from separate images, while both perspectives are meaningful and complementary.  
- External knowledge can further enhance video understanding but introducing it is non-trivial.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel two-stream framework to model video representations from temporal and non-temporal perspectives.
- Integrate the two perspectives in an end-to-end manner using self-distillation.
- Design a knowledge-enhanced feature fusion method to leverage external knowledge to integrate non-temporal features and introduce knowledge for scene label prediction.
- Use knowledge distillation to fuse representations from the two perspectives to balance performance and efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Two-stream architecture to comprehensively model videos from temporal and non-temporal perspectives.
- Knowledge-enhanced feature fusion method to effectively incorporate external knowledge.
- Self-distillation mechanism to integrate the two perspectives.
- Evaluations on real-world video dataset demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art baselines.
- Ablation studies validate the contributions of individual components.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to learn multi-perspective video representations enhanced with external knowledge for the task of video scene recognition. The introduced knowledge-enhanced non-temporal modeling and self-distillation are the main novelties that are shown to improve performance.
