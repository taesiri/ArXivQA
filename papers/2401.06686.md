# [Exploring Conversational Agents as an Effective Tool for Measuring   Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06686)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Heuristics and cognitive biases affect human decision-making. Detecting specific biases could enable better decision support tools. However, current bias measurement requires carefully designed experiments and human interpretation.
- There is a lack of automated and standardized approaches to measure cognitive biases, especially using conversational agents. 

Proposed Solution:
- Explore using conversational agents to measure cognitive biases across domains through multi-turn interactions.
- Propose a conversational agent architecture that incorporates bias measurement using existing experimental task designs from literature.
- Evaluate ability to measure framing and loss aversion biases through dialogues for trip planning.

Key Contributions:
- Identified representative decision tasks used in bias measurement experiments (RQ1).
- Showed a conversational agent can engage users in dialogues to measure framing and loss aversion biases (RQ2.1).
- Demonstrated increased confidence in bias measurement with more conversation turns (RQ2.3).
- Established potential for using conversational agents as an effective tool for measuring biases.

The paper lays the groundwork for developing conversational agents that can automatically generate decision tasks to measure biases. Findings demonstrate advantages of repeated measures over one-shot experiments for robust bias assessment.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

Exploring the potential of using conversational agents as an effective tool to measure various cognitive biases across different domains. Specifically, the paper proposes a conversational agent design that incorporates bias measurement mechanisms informed by existing experimental tasks. Preliminary experiments indicate that conversational agents can effectively measure framing and loss aversion biases through multi-turn interactions. A key finding is that the confidence in bias measurement increases with more turns, addressing limitations of one-shot bias measurements.

The paper lays the groundwork for future research on fully automating bias measurement using advancements in conversational AI. The planned research aims to measure prominent biases across three domains to establish conversational agents as a reliable bias measurement tool. The literature analysis also provides insights into selecting appropriate experimental task designs.

In summary, the main contribution is showing the promise of conversational agents for cognitive bias measurement and establishing a direction for improving and applying this approach across domains.
