# [SuperCLUE: A Comprehensive Chinese Large Language Model Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15020)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of this paper, the central research question appears to be: What is the best approach to construct a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Chinese large language models (LLMs) that can reliably predict their performance from the user perspective in real-world scenarios?The key aspects of this research question are:- Focusing on Chinese LLMs specifically, rather than English or multilingual models.- Aiming to build a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates diverse capabilities, not just performance on a single task. - Wanting the benchmark to predict how models would perform when interacting with real users, not just score well on artificial test sets.- Considering different evaluation approaches like open-ended questions, closed multi-choice questions, and side-by-side user ratings.- Analyzing whether capabilities measured by different methods actually correlate to real user preferences.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining open-ended conversational evaluation, closed multi-choice questions, and real user ratings, they can construct a benchmark for Chinese LLMs that reliably reflects performance from a user perspective. The paper then describes the creation of the SuperCLUE benchmark and presents experiments analyzing how well different evaluation methods correlate to real user preferences.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces SuperCLUE, a comprehensive Chinese language model benchmark consisting of queries and ratings from real users, open-ended single and multi-turn questions, and closed-ended questions derived from the open-ended ones, and shows that open-ended questions better reflect user preferences while combining open- and closed-ended formats best predicts real-world performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The use of large-scale Chinese benchmarks to evaluate language models is becoming increasingly common, with datasets like CLUE being pioneered in recent years. However, this paper introduces a new comprehensive benchmark SuperCLUE that aims to better reflect real-world user preferences through techniques like open-ended questions and user ratings. - Existing benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, etc. have focused primarily on English language models. SuperCLUE provides a large-scale Chinese benchmark to spur advances in Chinese LLMs specifically. The multilingual benchmarks like XTREME and XGLUE do contain some Chinese tasks, but are still English-centric overall.- Most benchmark datasets rely heavily on closed-ended multiple choice questions, which may not fully reflect how models perform in real interactive scenarios. By incorporating open-ended questions and actual user queries and ratings, SuperCLUE aims for greater alignment with real-world usage.- The inclusion of user ratings from the "battle platform" is unique. Rather than just having expert annotations or model-generated labels, having real users evaluate the models provides grounding in terms of true end-user preferences. This is a distinctive aspect not seen in most existing benchmarks.- Analyzing the complementarity between closed- and open-ended formats is novel. The paper makes a case for using both formats jointly for comprehensive evaluation, rather than just relying on one or the other exclusively as is typically done.- Leveraging superior models like GPT-4 as reliable automatic raters is a new technique made possible by recent advances in LLMs. Past human annotation efforts can now be augmented or replaced by model-based evaluation.Overall, the scope and techniques make SuperCLUE one of the most comprehensive and real-world aligned Chinese LLM benchmarks created so far. The insights on evaluation formats and leveraging models as raters will likely inform future benchmark design as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Expanding the benchmark with more test questions and across more capability categories. The authors mention they will further expand their test set and provide evaluation services to more community users.- Training better evaluation/rating models for open-ended questions. The authors demonstrate using GPT-4 as an automatic rater for open-ended questions, but suggest training more specialized models for this task.- Analyzing complementarity of different question formats in more depth. The authors show combining open- and closed-ended questions helps predict user preferences, but suggest more analysis on their complementarity.- Evaluating more models, especially more Chinese models as they become available. The authors evaluate 11 models but suggest evaluating more as they are developed.- Expanding to other languages beyond Chinese. The current benchmark focuses on Chinese, but the authors suggest expanding it to other languages by collecting data and evaluating models designed for those languages.- Investigating personalized evaluation and user clustering. The authors collect user preferences as gold standards but suggest analyzing differences between user groups.- Developing enhanced evaluation interfaces and workflows. The authors developed some interfaces but suggest enhancing them and the overall evaluation workflow.In summary, the key directions are around expanding the benchmark coverage, training better automated evaluation models, analyzing evaluation complementarity and personalization, and improving interfaces and workflows. The authors lay good groundwork and point to many promising areas for future investigation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces SuperCLUE, a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Chinese language models. SuperCLUE contains three complementary components: 1) CArena, a platform where users interact with and evaluate models; 2) OPEN, a dataset of open-ended single-turn and multi-turn questions across different capabilities like reasoning and knowledge; and 3) CLOSE, a set of closed-ended questions transformed from the OPEN questions. The authors evaluate several Chinese language models on SuperCLUE in a zero-shot setting and find that GPT-4 outperforms all models as expected, while MiniMax is the top Chinese model. Extensive analysis demonstrates that closed-ended questions alone are insufficient to reflect user preferences on open-ended interactions, but combining results on both can better predict user satisfaction. The authors also show GPT-4 can reliably automatically evaluate open-ended answers. Overall, SuperCLUE provides a comprehensive way to understand Chinese language models' capabilities on diverse skills and how they align with real user needs before deployment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces SuperCLUE, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Chinese language models. SuperCLUE consists of three complementary components: CArena, OPEN, and CLOSE. CArena contains actual user queries and ratings collected from a model battle platform where users interact with and evaluate two anonymous models. OPEN consists of 300 open-ended single-turn questions and 300 open-ended multi-turn dialogues, designed to cover diverse capabilities that users care about. CLOSE contains 300 closed-ended multiple choice questions transformed from the OPEN single-turn questions, aimed at analyzing the limitations of closed-ended evaluations. The paper evaluates 11 advanced Chinese language models on SuperCLUE in a zero-shot setting, with GPT-4 serving as the automatic evaluator for OPEN by comparing model responses in a pairwise manner. Results show the superiority of GPT-4 and a large gap between top Chinese models and the state-of-the-art. Analyses demonstrate the high human-machine agreement between GPT-4 and human ratings, the inability of CLOSE to reflect OPEN performance and user preferences, and the complementarity of OPEN and CLOSE for predicting user preferences. In summary, this work constructs a comprehensive Chinese benchmark SuperCLUE to facilitate model evaluation, and provides insights into the limitations of closed-ended evaluations versus open-ended interactive scenarios.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:The paper proposes a new comprehensive Chinese language model benchmark called SuperCLUE. The benchmark consists of three complementary components: 1) CArena, a model battle platform where users can interact with and rate anonymous models; 2) OPEN, a set of 600 open-ended single- and multi-turn questions covering 10 capability categories, evaluated by using GPT-4 as an automatic rater; and 3) CLOSE, a set of 300 closed-ended multiple choice questions transformed from the OPEN single-turn questions using GPT-3.5. The benchmark is designed to evaluate both the interactive capabilities and user preferences of Chinese language models in a more realistic setting compared to solely using closed-ended questions. The analysis shows that closed-ended accuracy has low correlation with user ratings and open-ended scores, but combining results on both can better reflect user preferences. Overall, the benchmark provides a more comprehensive evaluation method to understand Chinese language models' capabilities in real-world applications.
