# [Speedrunning and path integrals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of formal analogies between principles in physics, especially quantum mechanics, and other disciplines such as game theory and reinforcement learning. Developing such analogies could lead to new insights. 
- In particular, the authors propose an analogy between quantum mechanics principles and the gaming concept of "speedrunning" - where players try to complete video games as fast as possible.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors build an analogy between the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Feynman path integral approach, and speedrunning.

Key Principles Mapped in the Analogy:

1) Principle of Least Action in Classical Physics and Optimal Trajectories in Speedrunning:
- Just as with classical physics where the trajectory chosen is the one where action is stationary/optimal, in speedrunning, expert speedrunners converge to an optimal trajectory that minimizes time and satisfies constraints.

2) Path Integrals Formulation and Sum Over All Possible trajectories: 
- In quantum mechanics, the path integral approach sums over all possible trajectories to compute probabilities. Similarly, across multiple attempts by an expert speedrunner, one can think of the distribution of runs as a sum over possible trajectories in the game-space.

3) Classical Limit: 
- As Planck's constant goes to 0, path integrals converge to the classical optimal path. Similarly, as randomness/uncertainty in player skill decreases, runs converge closer and closer to the optimal path. There is a skill dependent "classicallimit".

4) Quantum Interpretations Like Many Worlds Theory:
- Speedrun attempts correspond to "worlds" that identical at start but may separate into different trajectories (branches) later on.  

Key Contributions:

1) The analogy allows using quantum formalism as an abstract layer or common theoretical ground for disciplines like game design, reinforcement learning, optimal control etc. 

2) It allows using speedrunning as a "toy model" to explore concepts in quantum foundations like Born probability rule, uncertainty relations etc. with a measure of control not present in microscopic quantum systems.

3) Provides a way to view player skill improvement over time as the "receding of the quantum realm" - greater mastery allows their runs to converge closer to classical optimal trajectories over time.

To summarize, the paper develops a mapping between quantum and gaming principles as a way to exchange key insights across disciplines. The speedrunning concept allows serving as an interactive "toy model" for foundational quantum ideas.
