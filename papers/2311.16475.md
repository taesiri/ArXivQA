# [Generating Human-Centric Visual Cues for Human-Object Interaction   Detection via Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16475)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called HCVC for human-object interaction (HOI) detection that leverages human-centric visual cues generated from large vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, the authors create three specialized prompts for VLMs to generate participant, body language, and environmental cues within an image, providing richer contextual information about the interactions from multiple human-centric perspectives. To capitalize on these cues, HCVC employs transformer-based multi-modal fusion modules to integrate the visual and cue features into both the instance decoder for detecting humans/objects and the interaction decoder for recognizing interactions. Experiments on HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that exploiting these human-centric visual cues enables HCVC to significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving especially large gains for rare/unseen classes. The visualization also shows that the model focuses on pertinent cues for interpreting interactions. Overall, by generating and incorporating human-centric context from VLMs, HCVC enhances the accuracy, robustness and interpretability of HOI understanding.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Proposing three prompts with large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate human-centric visual cues from multiple perspectives within an image, including participant cues, body language cues, and environmental cues. 

2. Proposing a novel HOI detection method named HCVC that leverages the generated human-centric visual cues to enhance the accuracy of instance and interaction decoders.

3. Devising a transformer-based multimodal fusion module with multi-tower architecture to effectively integrate visual features and visual cue features.

4. Validating the proposed HCVC method and demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art HOI detection methods on two widely used datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is using prompts with VLMs to generate useful human-centric visual cues from images and leveraging these cues in a novel framework HCVC to significantly improve the performance of HOI detection.
