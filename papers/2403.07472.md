# [Imbalance-aware Presence-only Loss Function for Species Distribution   Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Species distribution models (SDMs) are useful for predicting suitable habitats for species. However, there is often significant class imbalance in the datasets used to train SDMs - some common species have tens of thousands of observations while rare (but important for conservation) species have only a few dozen observations. Traditional losses used to train SDMs, like binary cross entropy, do not account for this imbalance and can perform poorly for rare species in predictions.

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes using a "full weighted loss" function that weights the loss for each species based on the inverse of its observation frequency in the training set. This loss upweights rare species compared to more common species, aiming to improve model performance on those rare species crucial for conservation efforts.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluates weighted loss on large multi-species datasets from citizen science initiatives (GeoLifeCLEF, iNaturalist), spanning thousands of plant/animal species globally. Many species have only 50 or fewer observations. 
- Shows that the weighted loss substantially improves predictive performance over standard losses, especially for species with few (less than 50) observations. These rare species see AUC/mAP gains of over 0.1 in some cases.
- Demonstrates that weighted loss performs equally well on less imbalanced datasets too, suggesting it is broadly useful for multi-species modeling from presence-only citizen science data with long-tailed observation distributions.
- Stresses that model evaluation should focus specifically on rare species performance given their importance, something enabled in benchmark datasets like GeoLifeCLEF 2023 through labeled validation data for hundreds of rare species.

In summary, the paper shows that an imbalance-aware weighted loss allows deep learning models to leverage large but imbalanced citizen science observation datasets to predict distributions more accurately for the rare species most vital for conservation efforts. The gains are substantial over standard losses on species with only dozens of observations.
