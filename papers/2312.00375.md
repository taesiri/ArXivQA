# [Text-Guided 3D Face Synthesis -- From Generation to Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00375)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FaceG2E, a novel text-guided framework for high-fidelity 3D face synthesis and editing. It consists of two main components: geometry-texture decoupled generation and self-guided consistency preserved editing. In the generation stage, facial geometry and texture are optimized separately to enhance detail and alignment. This is achieved by introducing geometry-centric score distillation sampling and geometry-aware texture content distillation. Additionally, fine-tuned texture diffusion models are used to improve texture quality. In the editing stage, an image editing diffusion model updates faces based on text instructions. To enable accurate sequential editing, a consistency preservation regularization weighted by a self-guided strategy is proposed. This adaptively determines the weight for each facial region from the model's built-in cross-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate FaceG2E's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generating diverse, realistic 3D faces and flexibly editing facial attributes. The customized edits can be sequentially adjusted to synthesize intricate 3D faces. Overall, this work represents an impactful advancement of text-guided 3D face modeling technology.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Text-Guided 3D Face Synthesis - From Generation to Editing":

Problem:
Generating detailed and realistic 3D human faces from text descriptions is challenging but important for applications like film making and VR/AR. Prior works have limitations in: (1) Generating high-fidelity geometry and texture aligned to text. (2) Enabling fine-grained face editing control to create customized faces through sequential adjustments. 

Method:
This paper proposes a text-guided 3D face synthesis approach with two main contributions:

1. Geometry-Texture Decoupled Generation: Separately generates geometry and texture in two phases. Geometry phase uses texture-less rendering and geometry-centric score distillation sampling (SDS) to focus on geometric details. Texture phase uses a geometry-aware texture SDS and fine-tuned texture diffusion models to align texture to geometry.

2. Self-Guided Consistency Preserved Editing: Employs an image-edit diffusion model for editing faces. Proposes (i) a UV domain consistency regularization to prevent unintended changes and allow sequential editing, and (ii) a self-guided consistency weighting strategy to balance editing effects vs. consistency based on attention scores.

Experiments:
Results demonstrate the approach generates diverse, realistic and animatable 3D faces aligned to text descriptions. The editing supports flexible operations like independent and sequential editing of geometry/texture. Comparisons to prior arts and user studies confirm superior visual quality and alignment to text.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in text-to-3D face generation by enabling both high-fidelity synthesis and precise sequential editing to create customized 3D digital humans. The editing technique is a first in the field.
