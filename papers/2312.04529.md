# [Diffusion Reflectance Map: Single-Image Stochastic Inverse Rendering of   Illumination and Reflectance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04529)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Diffusion Reflectance Map Network (DRMNet), the first single-image stochastic inverse rendering method that recovers the full frequency spectrum of illumination and object reflectance. The key idea is to formulate radiometric disentanglement on the reflectance map, which represents object appearance invariant to geometry. DRMNet learns to stochastically invert the image formation process modeled as a diffusion process that gradually filters high frequencies of natural illumination with lower frequency reflectance and Gaussian noise. It consists of two subnetworks: IllNet, a U-Net that recursively converts the observed reflectance map to a perfect mirror, and RefNet, a network that iteratively estimates the reflectance. DRMNet is trained on synthetic data and demonstrated to generalize well to real images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in estimating detailed natural illumination that enables relighting and object insertion with arbitrary materials. The explicitly generative approach breaks limitations of inverse rendering and captures inherent ambiguity. Overall, this principled integration of stochasticity enables single-image understanding not possible previously.
