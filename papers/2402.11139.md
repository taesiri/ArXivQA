# [LiGNN: Graph Neural Networks at LinkedIn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11139)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Developing graph neural networks (GNNs) at scale presents challenges like large-scale training, handling diverse entities, cold start issues for less active users, and capturing the dynamic nature of the LinkedIn ecosystem. 

Proposed Solution - LiGNN System:
- GNN Training Infrastructure: Uses Microsoft DeepGNN for distributed real-time graph sampling to overcome issues with precomputed static graphs. Introduces optimizations like Horovod training, gRPC retry, and GeneratorEnqueuer to improve training stability and speed.

- Handling Diverse Entities: Constructs a large heterogeneous graph with different types of nodes and edges representing different entities and interactions on LinkedIn. Allows different applications to leverage parts of graph relevant to them.

- Mitigating Cold Start: Employs graph densification to add edges between less active and more active users based on content similarity. This facilitates better information flow.

- Dynamic System: Incorporates temporal modeling in GNNs to capture evolving user interests based on recent activities. Also sets up a nearline inference pipeline to swiftly update representations.

Key Contributions:

- Scaling Up Training: Proposes techniques like adaptive neighbor sampling, local gradient aggregation, grouping and slicing, and shared-memory queue to achieve 7x faster training.

- Quality Improvements: Introduces innovations like graph densification, temporal modeling, ID embeddings, and multi-hop PPR sampling that lift baseline performance across multiple applications.

- Production Impact: Share deployment lessons and experimental results showing positive impact on metrics like feed engagement, job applications, ads CTR, and people recommendations.

In summary, the paper presents LiGNN, a scalable graph neural network framework deployed at LinkedIn to power various production applications while overcoming key challenges like cold start and dynamic environments. The techniques presented offer practical solutions for real-world graph learning systems.
