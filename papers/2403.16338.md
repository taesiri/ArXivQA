# [Impact of Video Compression Artifacts on Fisheye Camera Visual   Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16338)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous vehicles require large volumes of camera data for training robust perception models, leading to high storage costs. Lossless compression is insufficient, hence lossy video compression is needed.
- However, there is limited analysis on the impact of lossy compression artifacts on visual perception tasks, especially for fisheye cameras commonly used in vehicles. Fisheye images have significant radial distortion, especially towards the periphery.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze impact of HEVC and AVC compression on a fisheye 2D object detection task using the WoodScape and FishEye8K datasets.
- Propose a radial distortion-aware zonal mAP metric to evaluate compression impact on the peripheral regions.
- Present an epipole geometry guided motion prediction model to improve temporal prediction in VVC codec for fisheye video.

Key Contributions:
- First analysis of standard video codec impact on fisheye camera visual perception, showing 10x compression with negligible mAP drop and 80x compression with 1-2% mAP drop.
- Novel zonal mAP metric highlighting greater compression impact on peripheral regions with higher distortion in fisheye images.  
- 34% MSE reduction with epipole guided VVC motion prediction compared to baseline, enabling improved fisheye video compression.
- Suggestions to enhance video codec motion models for wide FOV and high speed automotive camera motion.

In summary, the paper provides valuable analysis to guide lossy fisheye video compression for automotive systems, while ensuring minimal impact on visual perception task accuracy. The proposed solutions help optimize compression and codec design for fisheye cameras.
