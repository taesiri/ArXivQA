# [Provable Policy Gradient Methods for Average-Reward Markov Potential   Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies Markov potential games under the infinite horizon average reward criterion, which is more suitable for long-term strategic interactions compared to the commonly used discounted reward. However, policy-based reinforcement learning methods for average reward games remain largely unexplored. 

Main Contributions:

1. The paper shows that the average reward is a smooth function of policies, providing smoothness bounds under certain ergodicity assumptions. This enables the analysis of gradient-based algorithms.

2. Three algorithms - policy gradient, proximal-Q learning, and natural policy gradient are analyzed. With access to a gradient oracle, convergence to an ε-Nash equilibrium with O(1/ε^2) iterations is shown. 

3. A single-trajectory policy gradient estimator is proposed and shown to estimate gradients with sample complexity Õ(1/(π(a|s)δ)). This is used to obtain the first sample complexity bound of Õ(1/ε^5) for a projected policy gradient algorithm.

4. The sensitivity of differential value functions is characterized, which plays an important role in establishing regret bounds independent of the action set size. 

5. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical convergence guarantees. A more complex robot navigation task demonstrates the potential of independent learning for average reward Markov games.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of policy optimization methods for average reward Markov potential games, establishing iteration complexity under perfect gradient information and sample complexity when gradients are estimated. The results demonstrate the potential of applying such games to model long-term multi-agent sequential interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies Markov potential games under the infinite horizon average reward criterion, analyzes the convergence and sample complexity of three independent learning algorithms - policy gradient, proximal-Q, and natural policy gradient - and establishes that they can find an ε-Nash equilibrium in polynomial time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It addresses the problem of average reward Markov potential games and analyzes three algorithms - policy gradient ascent, proximal-Q, and natural policy gradient (NPG). It shows that with access to a gradient oracle, these algorithms converge to an ε-Nash equilibrium with time complexity O(1/ε^2). 

2. When policy gradients have to be estimated from samples, it proposes a single-trajectory policy gradient estimator that can estimate the policy gradient with Õ(1/(π(a|s)δ)) sample complexity and δ approximation error. It also provides the first sample complexity analysis for a projected policy gradient ascent algorithm.

3. On the technical side, it rigorously shows that the average reward is a smooth function of the policy under an ergodicity assumption. It also establishes sensitivity bounds for differential value functions that play an important role in providing regret bounds independent of the action set size.

4. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of independent learning schemes and policy-based methods for average reward Markov games, which have been relatively less studied compared to discounted reward settings.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive analysis of policy optimization methods for average reward Markov potential games, including convergence guarantees, sample complexity bounds, and smoothing properties.

The paper analyzes algorithms like policy gradient ascent, proximal-Q, and natural policy gradient for finding Nash equilibria in average reward Markov potential games.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper establishes convergence guarantees and sample complexity bounds for policy gradient methods under the average reward setting. How do these results compare to prior work on policy gradients under discounted rewards? What new technical challenges arise in the average reward setting? 

2. The paper proposes a new single-trajectory policy gradient estimator. How does this estimator compare to prior policy gradient estimators? What advantages does it offer in terms of variance, sample complexity, or computational complexity?

3. The smoothness analysis of the average reward function is a key technical contribution of this work. How does the smoothness factor derived here compare to smoothness factors for discounted rewards? What causes the additional state space dependence?

4. The paper establishes sensitivity bounds for differential value functions in general average reward MDPs. How tight are these bounds? Can they be improved further? What other applications might these sensitivity bounds have?

5. This work focuses on the tabular setting. What additional challenges arise in extending the analysis to function approximation or neural network policies? Can any results be carried over and what new analyses would be needed?

6. The proximal-Q algorithm demonstrates improved dependence on the state space size compared to policy gradients. What causes this improvement? How do the update rules differ and why does proximal-Q not suffer the same curse of dimensionality?

7. What practical advantages might the natural policy gradient method offer compared to vanilla policy gradients, despite their similar theoretical guarantees? When might NPG be preferred in real applications?

8. How broadly applicable are the assumptions made in this work regarding ergodicity and isolated stationary points? Do common multi-agent learning problems satisfy these assumptions or are there important cases that violate them?

9. The paper focuses on independent learning. What changes would be needed to extend the analysis to joint policy learning? What additional challenges arise in that cooperative setting?

10. The convergence rate and sample complexity depend on several problem-dependent constants. What do these constants mean intuitively? Which have the biggest impact in practice and how might they be estimated?
