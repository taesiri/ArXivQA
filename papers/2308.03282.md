# [Environment-Invariant Curriculum Relation Learning for Fine-Grained   Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03282)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to alleviate the class imbalance and context imbalance in scene graph generation (SGG) to enable more accurate and fine-grained scene graph generation. The key hypotheses are:1) Existing SGG datasets have not only class imbalance in the distribution of predicate classes, but also context imbalance due to the different distributions of subject-object pairs. 2) Addressing both the class and context imbalance will lead to more robust and fine-grained scene graph generation.3) This can be achieved by:a) Learning an environment-invariant relation classifier using invariant risk minimization to alleviate context imbalance across different subject-object distributions.b) Using a class-balanced curriculum learning strategy to gradually focus the model from head to tail predicate classes and alleviate class imbalance.So in summary, the central research question is how to address both class and context imbalance in SGG to enable more accurate and finer-grained relation prediction. The key hypotheses are that explicitly modeling and alleviating both types of imbalance will improve SGG performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies and analyzes the context imbalance problem in scene graph generation (SGG), in addition to the commonly addressed class imbalance issue. The context imbalance refers to the imbalanced distribution of subject-object pairs for different predicate classes. 2. It proposes a novel framework called Environment Invariant Curriculum Relation (EICR) learning to address both the class and context imbalance issues in SGG. The key components are:- Environment Invariant Learning: Constructs multiple environments with different subject-object pair distributions and uses invariant risk minimization to learn a context-invariant relation classifier.- Class-Balanced Curriculum Learning: Gradually shifts focus from learning head predicates to tail predicates using a curriculum schedule, to alleviate class imbalance.3. Comprehensive experiments show that EICR brings significant improvements when applied to various SGG models on VG and GQA datasets. For example, it improves the VCTree model by over 14% on mR@50/100 metric.4. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed environment invariant learning and curriculum learning strategies.In summary, the key novelty is identifying and addressing the under-explored context imbalance issue in SGG, in addition to the commonly tackled class imbalance problem. The proposed EICR framework provides an effective solution to alleviate both imbalances.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel framework called Environment Invariant Curriculum Relation (EICR) learning to address both the class imbalance between predicate classes and the context imbalance between subject-object pairs in scene graph generation, by first learning an environment invariant relation classifier using multiple distribution environments and then applying a curriculum learning strategy to consolidate the classifier from frequent to rare predicates.
