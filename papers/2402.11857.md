# [Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning with Local Immediate Error   Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11857)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Distributed machine learning suffers from heavy communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional gradients between workers and server. Existing solutions either use unidirectional compression (e.g. MEM-SGD) which has higher communication cost, or bidirectional compression (e.g. DoubleSqueeze) which converges slower. It remains unclear whether bidirectional compression and fast convergence can be achieved simultaneously in an efficient way.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a distributed optimization algorithm called LIEC-SGD based on a novel local immediate error compensation framework and bidirectional compression. The key ideas are:

1) Local immediate error compensation: Each worker compresses the local gradient and caches the compression error. This error is immediately compensated to the update sent back from the server without any delay. 

2) Bidirectional compression: Apply compression on both uplink and downlink to reduce communication.

3) Periodic global model averaging and error reset: Average model parameters across workers and reset error on server periodically to eliminate discrepancies among local models and prevent error divergence.

Main Contributions:

1) LIEC-SGD achieves better convergence rate than previous bidirectional compression algorithms, and matches unidirectional compression algorithms. It inherits the advantages from both.

2) LIEC-SGD effectively reduces the norm of error variables, alleviating the "remained gradients" dilemma in traditional frameworks.

3) LIEC-SGD achieves linear speedup when number of iterations is sufficiently large. It converges faster and costs less time than previous algorithms.

4) Experiments on training deep neural networks validate LIEC-SGD outperforms baselines in test accuracy and time cost, showing the efficacy of the proposed techniques.

In summary, this paper breaks through the limitations of existing gradient compression algorithms via a carefully designed compensation strategy and bidirectional compression. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LIEC-SGD algorithm.
