# [EGTR: Extracting Graph from Transformer for Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to detect objects in an image and predict relationships between them, which is challenging. 
- Two-stage SGG models have high complexity and error propagation issues. Recent one-stage models have complex architectures to predict relations or focus only on related objects, missing standalone ones. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes EGTR, an efficient one-stage SGG model extracting relations from the self-attention in the object detector DECATR, using attention queries and keys as subject and object entities.
- A lightweight classifier predicts relations between them using both attention weights and final hidden states of queries, aggregated via gating.
- Adaptive smoothing adjusts relation labels based on detection uncertainties to allow curriculum focus on detection initially.  
- Connectivity prediction predicts relation existence between pairs as an auxiliary task.

Main Contributions:
- Lightweight model generating complete scene graphs utilizing self-attention by-products from the object detector.
- Adaptive smoothing for effective multi-task learning based on continuous curriculum.
- Connectivity prediction aiding relation extraction.
- Comprehensive experiments proving efficiency and effectiveness of EGTR, showing top object detection and competitive relation extraction performance.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient one-stage scene graph generation model called EGTR that exploits the self-attention in the object detector to effectively predict relationships between objects. Key techniques like adaptive smoothing and connectivity prediction enable superior overall performance.
