# [Scaling Sparse Fine-Tuning to Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16405)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Scaling Sparse Fine-Tuning to Large Language Models":

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters are difficult to fine-tune due to their sheer size. Full fine-tuning is computationally infeasible while prior work on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like sparse fine-tuning (SFT) still incur a memory overhead proportional to the number of LLM parameters during training. Thus, there is a need for SFT techniques that can scale to state-of-the-art LLMs without prohibitive memory requirements.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a family of iterative SFT algorithms that alternate between (a) updating only a small set of parameters, (b) dropping obsolete parameters, and (c) carefully growing new parameters based on accumulated gradients (\sftrigl method) or approximate momenta from efficient optimizers like SM3 (\sftsm method). At any time, only the indices and deltas of the active parameters are maintained, keeping memory complexity proportional to the SFT density rather than LLM size.

Main Contributions:
- First SFT method with memory overhead linear in number of fine-tuned parameters rather than total parameters 
- Introduction of new criteria for growing parameters based on multi-step accumulated gradients or approximate momenta
- Demonstration that SFT matches or exceeds alternative PEFT methods like LoRA and (IA)3 on LLaMA 2.0 7B and 13B models fine-tuned and evaluated on a variety of instruction tuning datasets  
- Showing compatibility of SFT with model quantization down to 4 bits and efficient optimizers like SM3
- Releasing optimized open-source SFT implementations to facilitate adoption

The proposed SFT techniques make it feasible to effectively fine-tune even the largest current LLMs on modern accelerators within reasonable time and memory budgets. The results showcase SFT as an important tool for unlocking further progress in language model transfer learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes memory-efficient methods for sparse fine-tuning of large language models that achieve competitive performance with other parameter-efficient techniques while using less GPU memory.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a memory-efficient method for scaling sparse fine-tuning to large language models. Specifically, the paper introduces an iterative paradigm that alternates between updating the active parameter deltas, dropping obsolete parameters, and growing new parameters based on accumulated gradients or approximate momenta. This allows sparse fine-tuning to achieve similar performance to full fine-tuning while having a memory overhead that scales with the number of fine-tuned parameters rather than the total number of model parameters. The paper shows strong performance of the proposed sparse fine-tuning methods compared to popular techniques like LoRA when instruction tuning large LLM models like LLaMA 2.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative paradigm for sparse fine-tuning that alternates between updating deltas of active indices, deleting obsolete indices, and growing new indices. Can you explain in more detail the criteria used for deleting and growing indices in the two proposed algorithms SFT-RIGL and SFT-SM3?

2. The paper mentions accumulating gradients over multiple steps to estimate "long-run" gradients for the growth phase in SFT-RIGL. Why is this better than using gradients from a single step as in previous work? How sensitive is the method to the number of steps used for accumulation?

3. For SFT-SM3, the paper uses the momentum estimates from the SM3 optimizer to select indices to grow. Intuitively, why might this be a reasonable choice? Does the assumption of parameter importance being correlated with others in the same row/column seem to hold based on analysis?

4. How exactly are the optimizer momentum buffers handled when growing new indices in both SFT-RIGL and SFT-SM3? Are there any complications that arise in mapping momentum values for existing versus newly grown parameters?

5. The results show SFT-RIGL outperforms SFT-SM3 overall but there are a few exceptions. What might account for cases where SFT-SM3 does better? Could differences in sample efficiency or tuning explain this?

6. For quantized SFT, what are the tradeoffs incurred by quantizing most pretrained parameters to 4 bits versus maintaining full precision for the small number of SFT parameters? Is there a "sweet spot" in this tradeoff?

7. The paper uses a fixed schedule for dropping and growing parameters. Could an adaptive schedule that redistributes parameters based on intermediate results lead to better performance? What challenges would this introduce?

8. How exactly is the backward pass for SFT implemented currently? The appendix mentions possible ways to optimize the gradient calculation - what speedups might be possible here?

9. The parameter ages analysis shows differences between SFT variants and model sizes. What underlying reasons might account for these differences in training dynamics? Could this analysis inform better schedules?

10. How might SFT handle very long sequence lengths compared to methods like LoRA? Could differences on certain tasks be attributed to max sequence length rather than the adaptability of SFT itself?
