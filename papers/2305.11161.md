# [TOME: A Two-stage Approach for Model-based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11161)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME that makes the following key contributions:

1. It utilizes tokenized URLs as document identifiers, which are natural language strings better aligned with the vocabulary of generative pre-trained language models compared to manually constructed ids. This helps mitigate the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning.

2. It employs a two-stage generation architecture with separate models for passage generation and URL generation. The passage generation stage produces a relevant passage for the query, while the URL generation stage maps this to a URL identifier. This reduces the discrepancy between training and inference.

3. It proposes training strategies like query augmentation, reducing passage length, and model scaling to optimize the generation models, especially for large corpora.

So in summary, the main contribution is the design of the two-stage TOME model for model-based retrieval using URL identifiers and optimized training strategies. Experiments show TOME outperforms previous model-based retrieval methods and analysis provides insights into scaling laws.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME that uses tokenized URLs as document identifiers and a passage generation model followed by a URL generation model to reduce the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning as well as the gap between training and inference.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How to improve model-based text retrieval by dealing with the discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, and the discrepancy between training and inference?

Specifically, the paper identifies two major challenges with existing model-based retrieval approaches:

1) The discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, caused by the use of random or manual document identifiers that are not well captured during pre-training of the generative language model.

2) The discrepancy between training and inference, caused by modeling both documents and queries during training but only queries during inference. 

To address these issues, the paper proposes a two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME, with two main technical contributions:

1) Using tokenized URLs as identifiers, which are more aligned with the vocabulary distribution seen during pre-training.

2) A two-stage generation architecture that includes passage generation and URL generation stages. This helps reduce the training-inference discrepancy and make the process more robust.

So in summary, the central research question is how to improve model-based retrieval by dealing with pre-training/fine-tuning and training/inference discrepancies, which is addressed through the proposed TOME approach and URL identifier design.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in model-based text retrieval:

- Using tokenized URLs as document identifiers is a novel idea not explored much before. Most prior work uses random or manual docids. Using real URLs better aligns with the pre-training of generative models. 

- The two-stage generation architecture is also unique. It helps reduce the train-inference discrepancy in single-stage models. The progressive generation process enables correcting errors from the first stage.

- The paper proposes several useful training strategies like query augmentation, passage length reduction, and model scaling. These help deal with challenges in training and scaling up model-based retrieval. 

- Experiments on MS MARCO and Natural Questions datasets demonstrate effectiveness over other model-based methods. The analyses also provide insights into model capabilities and scaling laws.

- Performance is competitive with dense retrievers on smaller datasets, but gaps remain on larger corpora. Memorization of huge corpora is still a limitation compared to generalization of dense models.

- Overall, using URL identifiers and the two-stage design are novel ideas for model-based retrieval. The training strategies and analyses also provide valuable insights. But scaling to huge corpora and closing the gap with dense retrievers remains an open challenge. The work gives useful directions for future research.

In summary, the key novelties are using URL identifiers and the two-stage generation architecture. The training strategies and analyses also contribute insights. More work is still needed to scale model-based retrieval to massive corpora. But this provides a strong step in that direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further improving model-based retrieval to close the performance gap with dense retrievers, especially on large-scale corpora. The authors note there is still a gap compared to methods like DPR when scaling up to larger datasets, so more work is needed to improve model-based retrieval at scale.

- Exploring different model architectures and training strategies for model-based retrieval. The two-stage approach proposed in this paper is one attempt to improve model-based retrieval, but the authors suggest further architectural innovations could help advance this paradigm. The analysis on scaling laws also provides insights into how factors like model size impact training.

- Designing better document identifiers as generation targets. The use of tokenized URLs is proposed in this work, but the authors suggest exploring other natural language identifiers that are well captured during pre-training. 

- Mitigating the challenges of long text generation for model-based retrieval. Passage generation was identified as a difficulty during training, so techniques to improve convergence and efficiency for long text generation could further enhance model-based methods.

- Applications to other domains beyond Web documents and Wikipedia. Most experiments focused on MS MARCO and Natural Questions datasets, but the authors suggest expanding evaluation to other data sources.

- Analysis of energy and computing requirements. The authors note model-based retrieval's high compute demands as an area for further analysis, especially regarding risks of energy use and emissions.

In summary, advancing model-based retrieval at scale, innovating on model architectures, designing better text identifiers, improving long text generation, expanding to new domains, and analysis of sustainability are highlighted as key directions for future research. The results and analysis in this paper provide a foundation for progress in these areas.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing two main issues with current model-based retrieval methods:

1. The discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning due to the use of randomly generated or manually constructed document identifiers (docids) that don't exist in real-world text corpora. This limits the generative capabilities of pre-trained language models. 

2. The discrepancy between training and inference arising from the single-model generative architecture, where the model processes both documents and queries during training but only queries during inference.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME that makes two main technical contributions:

1. Using tokenized URLs as identifiers, which are well aligned with the vocabulary of generative PLMs and help bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning.

2. A two-stage architecture with separate models for passage generation and URL generation to reduce the training-inference discrepancy and make the process more robust and progressive.
