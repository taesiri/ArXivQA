# [PRP Rebooted: Advancing the State of the Art in FOND Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning. FOND planning is a variant of classical symbolic planning where actions have non-deterministic effects, meaning the outcome of executing an action is not fully known beforehand. While there has been progress in solving FOND problems over the past 20 years, there is still room for significant improvement. The paper aims to advance the state of the art in efficient and scalable FOND planning.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new FOND planner called "PRP Rebooted" (PR2) that builds off the strengths of previous leading planners, while introducing several novel techniques. Like some prior planners, PR2 employs classical replanning on a determinized version of the problem. It uses a powerful compressed solution representation similar to other state-of-the-art planners. The key novel elements of PR2 include:

- Better handling of deadends during search using generalization and node poisoning
- A preprocessing step to simplify problems by removing redundant objects 
- A custom heuristic that incorporates information about forbidden state-action pairs to guide the weak planning search underlying PR2's main algorithm
- Aggressive strengthening of the solution representation to compactly capture goal reachability 

Together, these techniques yield a planner that substantially advances the state of the art.

Main Contributions:

- A new best-in-class FOND planner, PR2, that significantly outperforms prior leading planners on common benchmark domains
- Introduction of several new techniques like redundant object removal, forbidden state-action pair aware heuristics and aggressive solution strengthening that collectively achieve the performance gains
- Formal theoretical results establishing soundness and completeness for the overall PR2 approach
- Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrating decisively superior performance across 801 benchmark problems spanning 18 domains

In summary, the paper makes noteworthy research contributions advancing the state of the art in FOND planning, enabled by the new PR2 planner and its constituent algorithms. PR2 demonstrates substantially broader coverage and scalability compared to prior planners on common benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents PRP Rebooted (PR2), a new state-of-the-art Fully Observable Non-Deterministic (FOND) planner that significantly outperforms prior FOND planners by leveraging and extending their key techniques in a novel search framework centered around an incremental construction of compact solution representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a new state-of-the-art FOND planner called PRP Rebooted (PR2) that outperforms previous leading FOND planners on a comprehensive benchmark suite. Specifically:

- PR2 introduces a novel solution representation that combines a compact policy graph along with a reachable state space graph to effectively search for and represent FOND solutions. This builds on ideas from prior planners like GRENDEL and FONDSAT.

- A variety of new techniques are proposed in PR2, including better deadend handling, problem simplification through redundant object removal, a custom FOND-aware heuristic, and procedures to strengthen the policy graph. 

- Experiments across 18 domains and 800 problem instances demonstrate decisively better performance from PR2 compared to top prior FOND planners PRP, FONDSAT, MyND, and Paladinus. This includes outperforming them on existing benchmarks as well as new domains.

- Ablation studies indicate the contributions of different components of PR2, with the proposed FOND-aware heuristic having the biggest impact.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the state of the art in FOND planning through the proposed PR2 planner and its novel techniques for efficiently solving FOND problems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Fully Observable Non-Deterministic (FOND) planning
- Strong cyclic plans
- Logical regression
- Forbidden state-action pairs (FSAPs)
- Solution representation using controller graph (\psgraph) and reachable state space graph (\csgraph)
- Fixed point regression 
- Node poisoning for deadend avoidance
- FSAP-aware FF heuristic
- Object sampling for problem simplification
- Forcing 1-safe weak plans
- Performance comparison against leading FOND planners (MyND, FONDSAT, PRP, Paladinus)

The paper introduces a new FOND planner called PRP Rebooted (\us) that outperforms prior state-of-the-art planners on a comprehensive benchmark suite. The key ideas have to do with the dual graph representation, techniques for strengthening solutions, deadend handling, and custom heuristics that account for nondeterminism. Ultimately the paper demonstrates a significant advance in algorithms and systems for FOND planning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new FOND planner called PRP Rebooted (PR2). How is the high-level search strategy and use of regression in PR2 similar to and different from the PRP planner?

2. Explain the dual graph representation used in PR2 to represent the solution, specifically the roles of the Policy Graph (\psgraph) and Reachable State Space (\csgraph). How do these two graphs work together?

3. What is the Fixed Point Regression procedure in PR2 and how does it help to strengthen the conditions associated with nodes in the \psgraph? Explain with an example.

4. Explain the Full Strong Cyclic Marking algorithm for the \psgraph in PR2. Why is it an important procedure and how does it provide soundness guarantees? 

5. How does PR2 handle deadends and forbid bad actions? Explain the use of generalized deadends and Forbidden State-Action Pairs (FSAPs).

6. The paper claims the FSAP-aware FF heuristic is a key contributor to PR2's performance. Explain how this heuristic works and how it takes non-determinism into account in a way previous FOND planners did not.

7. Explain the redundant object sampling pre-processing done in PR2 and why it is sound to solve simplified instances with fewer objects. How might this be generalized?

8. What theoretical guarantees does PR2 provide in terms of soundness and completeness? Sketch out the arguments. Where do regressability and fixed point regression come into play?

9. Compare and contrast the overall approach of PR2 to other leading FOND planners like MyND, FONDSAT, PRP, and Paladinus. What aspects were inspired by each of these planners?

10. The paper claims "a new state of the art" for FOND planning. Based on the empirical evaluation, do you agree? What evidence supports or refutes this claim? How might the benchmarks be expanded/improved?
