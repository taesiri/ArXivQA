# [PRP Rebooted: Advancing the State of the Art in FOND Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning. FOND planning is a variant of classical symbolic planning where actions have non-deterministic effects, meaning the outcome of executing an action is not fully known beforehand. While there has been progress in solving FOND problems over the past 20 years, there is still room for significant improvement. The paper aims to advance the state of the art in efficient and scalable FOND planning.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new FOND planner called "PRP Rebooted" (PR2) that builds off the strengths of previous leading planners, while introducing several novel techniques. Like some prior planners, PR2 employs classical replanning on a determinized version of the problem. It uses a powerful compressed solution representation similar to other state-of-the-art planners. The key novel elements of PR2 include:

- Better handling of deadends during search using generalization and node poisoning
- A preprocessing step to simplify problems by removing redundant objects 
- A custom heuristic that incorporates information about forbidden state-action pairs to guide the weak planning search underlying PR2's main algorithm
- Aggressive strengthening of the solution representation to compactly capture goal reachability 

Together, these techniques yield a planner that substantially advances the state of the art.

Main Contributions:

- A new best-in-class FOND planner, PR2, that significantly outperforms prior leading planners on common benchmark domains
- Introduction of several new techniques like redundant object removal, forbidden state-action pair aware heuristics and aggressive solution strengthening that collectively achieve the performance gains
- Formal theoretical results establishing soundness and completeness for the overall PR2 approach
- Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrating decisively superior performance across 801 benchmark problems spanning 18 domains

In summary, the paper makes noteworthy research contributions advancing the state of the art in FOND planning, enabled by the new PR2 planner and its constituent algorithms. PR2 demonstrates substantially broader coverage and scalability compared to prior planners on common benchmarks.
