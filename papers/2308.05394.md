# [Robust Localization with Visual-Inertial Odometry Constraints for   Markerless Mobile AR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) tracks device pose locally but drifts over time. Absolute pose regressors (APRs) estimate global pose but have lower accuracy and stability. This limits precise and robust markerless augmented reality.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes VIO-APR, a framework that combines a VIO system with an APR method to leverage their complementary strengths. 

- It has two main stages:
   1. Period Alignment: Uses VIO to identify a sequence of accurate APR poses. Computes average poses as reliable references.
   2. Pose Optimization: Optimizes unreliable APR poses using reliable references and VIO data. Compensates for VIO drift.
   
- Repeats these two stages periodically. Reliable APR frames calibrate VIO drift over time. Unreliable frames are optimized using VIO and reliable references.

Main Contributions:

- Design an APR-agnostic framework to model uncertainty of APR using VIO and optimize poses
- Release a rich dataset with VIO and other sensor data for indoor and outdoor AR localization
- Implement and evaluate framework over two APR methods, improving accuracy significantly
- Build mobile AR application with framework that enables faster and smoother experiences

The key insight is to leverage the complementary strengths of APR methods and VIO systems to enable more precise localization for AR. By modeling uncertainty and optimizing poses over time, the framework provides both global accuracy and local stability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces VIO-APR, a framework that combines an absolute pose regressor with a visual-inertial odometry system to improve camera localization accuracy and stability for markerless mobile augmented reality by having the VIO evaluate and optimize the regressor's pose estimates while the regressor corrects for VIO drift.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Designing an APR-agnostic framework, called VIO-APR, that fuses information from a mobile VIO system to model the uncertainty of APR outputs. It selects poses with low uncertainty, filters poses with high uncertainty, and optimizes some estimated poses from the APR using reference poses calculated from the selected poses.

2. Releasing a rich indoor and outdoor dataset with VIO data, including raw sensor data from a modern smartphone. The dataset has multiple pose labels for each image, including ground truth from COLMAP and the 6DoF pose from ARKit.

3. Implementing and evaluating the VIO-APR framework over two APR models - PoseNet and MS-Transformer. The framework significantly improves the accuracy and precision levels of both models over the collected dataset.

4. Integrating VIO-APR into a mobile AR application that leverages ARKit data to optimize APR poses. This results in more accurate relocalizations and smoother AR experiences with low computation and energy consumption.

In summary, the main contribution is designing, implementing and evaluating an APR-agnostic framework that combines APR with VIO to improve localization accuracy and robustness for mobile augmented reality. The paper also releases a dataset and demo to support research in this direction.

The paper introduces a framework called "VIO-APR" that combines visual-inertial odometry (VIO) from mobile devices with absolute pose regression (APR) methods to improve camera localization accuracy for augmented reality applications. Key aspects include using the VIO to select reliable APR keyframes, optimizing unreliable APR poses, and compensating for VIO drift over time. The approach is evaluated on a new dataset with VIO data captured on mobile devices, and demonstrated in a mobile AR application. Central goals are improving localization accuracy and AR stability on mobile platforms.
