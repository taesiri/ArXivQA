# [DistALANER: Distantly Supervised Active Learning Augmented Named Entity   Recognition in the Open Source Software Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional named entity recognition (NER) models struggle with domain-specific data like software systems due to being trained on generic corpora. 
- Obtaining quality annotated data is challenging and expensive for specialized domains like software.
- Existing distantly supervised methods have limitations in expanding dictionaries and handling new entities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DistALANER, a distantly supervised active learning framework for NER tailored to software systems.  
- It employs a two-step annotation process using language heuristics, lookup tables, knowledge sources and active learning to generate labeled data.  
- The framework strategically expands dictionaries over time without relying on ambiguous strings or rules.  

Key Contributions:
- Releases large datasets of system annotated entities, human annotated entities and entity relations.
- Proposes an effective data expansion method harnessing temporal software data. Experiments show improved annotation quality.   
- Without human involvement, DistALANER outperforms baseline models and even supervised models on two large datasets.
- Demonstrates NER effectiveness on downstream relation extraction task, outperforming vanilla BERT.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming Large Language Models like GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 and Google BARD.

The paper puts forth an innovative distantly supervised active learning strategy to effectively generate labeled data for NER in software systems. By strategically expanding dictionaries and leveraging temporal software data, it achieves superior performance over existing methods. The released datasets and demonstration of NER's utility in relation extraction aim to facilitate future research.
