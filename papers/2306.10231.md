# [GLIMMER: generalized late-interaction memory reranker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the quality-compute tradeoff for retrieval-augmented language models. In particular, it proposes a model called GLIMMER that aims to achieve higher performance at faster speeds compared to prior methods like LUMEN and FiD. The key ideas in GLIMMER are:1) Incorporating a built-in reranker that reuses the initial layers of the live encoder to select the most relevant passages, improving retrieval quality at low computational cost.2) Sharing the memory and live encoder across tasks and training them with multi-task learning. This enables training the memory encoder and improves the live encoder, especially when it has lower capacity.3) Unifying reranking and memory augmentation into a single end-to-end model, with joint training to optimize both components.The hypothesis is that by exploiting efficient passage reranking and multi-task learning, GLIMMER can outperform prior work like LUMEN and FiD in terms of both quality and computational efficiency on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The experiments aim to validate whether this integrated approach effectively improves the quality-compute tradeoff.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing GLIMMER, a late interaction approach that combines reranking and memory augmentation into a single end-to-end model. The key ideas are:1. Incorporating a built-in reranker that reuses the initial layers of the live encoder to select relevant passages, improving retrieval quality at low cost.2. Sharing the memory and live encoder across tasks and training with multi-task fine-tuning. This allows training the memory encoder and greatly increases effectiveness of the live encoder. 3. Unifying reranking and memory augmentation, allowing retrieved passages to provide both context for the reader as well as targets for the reranker.4. Achieving strong gains in both quality and speed over prior late interaction approaches like LUMEN and standard retrieval augmentation like FiD. In summary, GLIMMER improves over prior work by combining reranking, memory augmentation, and multi-task training into a single model that obtains much better performance at faster speeds on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The key innovation is efficiently unifying reranking and memory in an end-to-end trainable model.
