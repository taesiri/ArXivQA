# [VividTalk: One-Shot Audio-Driven Talking Head Generation Based on 3D   Hybrid Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01841)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VividTalk, a novel two-stage framework for generating high-quality talking head videos from just an audio clip and a single facial image. In the first Audio-to-Mesh stage, the audio is mapped to both coarse blendshape motions and fine-grained vertex offsets to model expressive facial expressions. A novel learnable head pose codebook is also proposed to generate natural and continuous head motion from the audio. These motions are applied to a reconstructed 3D face mesh. The second Mesh-to-Video stage uses a dual branch motion-VAE architecture to model both global facial motion and detailed lip motion from the driven meshes. These motions are passed to a generator that synthesizes highly realistic and identity-preserving talking head videos with accurate lip synchronization. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with both quantitative metrics and user studies confirming VividTalk's ability to produce videos exceeding prior works in quality, expressiveness, and realism. The two-stage cascade enables end-to-end generation from audio to video while allowing flexible training. Overall, VividTalk significantly advances the state-of-the-art in this challenging one-shot audio-driven talking head generation task.
