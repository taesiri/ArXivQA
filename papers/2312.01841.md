# [VividTalk: One-Shot Audio-Driven Talking Head Generation Based on 3D   Hybrid Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01841)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VividTalk, a novel two-stage framework for generating high-quality talking head videos from just an audio clip and a single facial image. In the first Audio-to-Mesh stage, the audio is mapped to both coarse blendshape motions and fine-grained vertex offsets to model expressive facial expressions. A novel learnable head pose codebook is also proposed to generate natural and continuous head motion from the audio. These motions are applied to a reconstructed 3D face mesh. The second Mesh-to-Video stage uses a dual branch motion-VAE architecture to model both global facial motion and detailed lip motion from the driven meshes. These motions are passed to a generator that synthesizes highly realistic and identity-preserving talking head videos with accurate lip synchronization. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with both quantitative metrics and user studies confirming VividTalk's ability to produce videos exceeding prior works in quality, expressiveness, and realism. The two-stage cascade enables end-to-end generation from audio to video while allowing flexible training. Overall, VividTalk significantly advances the state-of-the-art in this challenging one-shot audio-driven talking head generation task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes VividTalk, a two-stage framework for high-quality talking head video generation that maps audio to 3D facial motions and then synthesizes video frames, achieving state-of-the-art performance in lip synchronization, expression, pose diversity, and visual quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes to map the long-term audio context to both blendshape and vertex to maximize the representation capability of the model for facial expression motion. An elaborate multi-branch generator is designed to model global and local facial motions individually.

2. It proposes a novel learnable head pose codebook with a two-phase training mechanism to model the rigid head motion more reasonably. 

3. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method (called VividTalk) outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality talking head videos that can be generalized across various subjects. The results have enhanced lip-sync, expressive facial expressions, various head poses, and high video quality.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel and generic framework (VividTalk) that can generate realistic talking head videos with natural head motion and expressive facial expressions from just an image and an audio clip. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show it advances the state-of-the-art in this task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Talking head generation - The paper focuses on audio-driven talking head video generation, where a facial image is animated according to an audio speech signal.

- Lip synchronization - An important aspect of talking head generation is achieving accurate lip sync between the mouth motion and audio speech. 

- Facial expression - In addition to lip sync, generating expressive facial expressions is also a goal.

- Head pose - Modeling and generating natural head motion and poses is another challenge tackled. 

- 3D morphable model (3DMM) - The paper uses a 3D morphable face model as an intermediate representation to model facial motion.

- Blendshapes - A specific parameterization of the 3DMM using blender shape bases for facial expressions.

- Mesh vertices - The 3D mesh vertex positions are also used as an intermediate representation.

- Transformer - Transformer networks are used in the audio to motion mapping architecture.

- Codebook - A discrete codebook is used to generate plausible head poses.

- Motion VAE - A variational autoencoder captures facial motion for video generation.

So in summary, key terms cover intermediate 3D facial representations, audio-to-motion mapping, modeling of expression and pose, as well as video generation from the animated representations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using both blendshapes and vertex offsets as intermediate representations to model facial motion. Why is using both better than using just one? What are the limitations of using blendshapes or vertex offsets alone?

2. The multi-branch transformer architecture is used to model global and local facial motion separately. Why is it beneficial to model them separately instead of together? How does injecting subject-specific style help alleviate the "mean face" problem?

3. Explain the two-phase training process for the learnable head pose codebook in detail. Why is it better to learn a discrete codebook rather than directly regressing the head poses?

4. The initial head pose is provided as a condition to the mapping network. Why is this important? What would happen if the initial pose was not provided?

5. Describe how the projection textures are rendered from the 3D meshes. Why render both inner face and outer face textures? What is the benefit of using the Normalized Coordinate Code?

6. Explain the dual branch architecture for the motion VAE. Why have separate branches for facial motion and lip motion instead of a single combined branch? 

7. The generator synthesizes frames in a sequential manner. Why is this better than generating all frames independently in parallel? Does the generator utilize any temporal modelling?

8. The two stages are trained separately but can be cascaded at test time. What difficulties arise from end-to-end joint training? Could any components be fine-tuned jointly?

9. The method focuses on modelling facial identity and motion realism. What other attributes could be modelled to improve realism further, e.g. hair, eyes, teeth? How challenging would this be?

10. The method requires an audio-visual dataset for training. What other data could be leveraged for better generalization, e.g. 3D face scans, text prompts? Would sim-to-real transfer work?
