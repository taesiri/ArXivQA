# [Imitator: Personalized Speech-driven 3D Facial Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00023)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to generate personalized 3D facial animations from speech that match the idiosyncrasies and speaking style of a target subject, using only a short video clip of the subject as a reference. The key ideas proposed to address this question are:- Using a transformer-based model to generate style-agnostic "viseme" features from input audio. This captures the speech content in a generalized way.- Having a separate motion decoder that takes the viseme features and a learned style embedding to generate personalized animations. The style embedding and motion decoder can be adapted to a new subject using a short reference video.- Introducing a novel loss function based on detecting bilabial consonants ('m','b','p') to ensure plausible lip closures in the generated animations.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by disentangling speech content and personal style, and using losses tailored for facial animation, they can generate high-quality personalized talking animations adapted from just a short video of a new subject. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
