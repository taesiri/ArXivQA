# [Imitator: Personalized Speech-driven 3D Facial Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00023)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to generate personalized 3D facial animations from speech that match the idiosyncrasies and speaking style of a target subject, using only a short video clip of the subject as a reference. 

The key ideas proposed to address this question are:

- Using a transformer-based model to generate style-agnostic "viseme" features from input audio. This captures the speech content in a generalized way.

- Having a separate motion decoder that takes the viseme features and a learned style embedding to generate personalized animations. The style embedding and motion decoder can be adapted to a new subject using a short reference video.

- Introducing a novel loss function based on detecting bilabial consonants ('m','b','p') to ensure plausible lip closures in the generated animations.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by disentangling speech content and personal style, and using losses tailored for facial animation, they can generate high-quality personalized talking animations adapted from just a short video of a new subject. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. A novel auto-regressive motion synthesis architecture that disentangles generalized viseme generation from a person-specific motion decoder. This allows for adaptation to new users with just a short reference video.

2. A lip contact loss formulation based on detected bilabial consonants ('m','b','p') to ensure plausible lip closures and improve realism of the generated facial expressions. 

Specifically, the paper proposes Imitator, a speech-driven 3D facial animation method that learns identity-specific details from a short input video and generates novel expressions matching the identity's speaking style. It trains a style-agnostic transformer on a facial expression dataset as a prior, then optimizes for identity-specific style based on a short reference video. The lip contact loss is introduced to ensure proper lip closures for bilabial consonants.

Through experiments and a user study, the paper shows Imitator produces temporally coherent facial expressions from audio that preserve the target actor's speaking style. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in evaluation metrics and user studies.
