# [Learning to Transfer Prompts for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01543)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we effectively transfer prompts learned from source text generation tasks to improve performance on new target text generation tasks, especially in low-resource settings?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Prompts encode useful task-specific knowledge that can be transferred across related text generation tasks.

2) Considering both task-level and instance-level information when constructing target prompts leads to better transfer of knowledge compared to using just task-level prompts.

3) An adaptive attention mechanism over a pool of clustered source prompts allows selecting the most relevant knowledge for a given target instance.

4) Prompt transfer will be especially beneficial in few-shot scenarios where target tasks have very limited labeled data.

So in summary, the central research question is how to do effective prompt transfer for text generation. The key hypotheses are that prompts encode transferable knowledge, that considering instance information helps transfer the most useful knowledge, and that this approach will particularly help in low-resource target tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel prompt-based transfer learning approach called PTG for text generation. The key ideas include:

- Learning a set of "source prompts" from representative source text generation tasks, which encode task-specific knowledge. 

- Transferring these source prompts as "target prompts" to new text generation tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot setting.

- Designing an adaptive attention mechanism to construct target prompts that considers both task-level and instance-level information. This allows selecting the most relevant source prompts for a given input instance.

- Releasing the learned source prompts as an open-source prompt library that can be reused to improve new text generation tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the idea of prompt transfer to text generation and developing a model called PTG that can effectively transfer prompts between diverse text generation tasks in a lightweight and adaptive manner. The release of the prompt library is also an important contribution for future research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompt-based transfer learning approach for text generation tasks, which learns source prompts from representative tasks and transfers them to target tasks using an adaptive attention mechanism considering both task- and instance-level characteristics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for transferring knowledge from multiple source text generation tasks to improve performance on new target text generation tasks via prompt-based learning. Here are some key ways this work compares to related prior research:

- Leverages prompt-based learning for transfer across text generation tasks: Prior work has explored prompt tuning for individual text generation tasks, but this paper is one of the first to investigate transferring prompts between different text generation tasks. 

- Transfers a set of prompts from diverse source tasks: Most prior prompt transfer works learn a single prompt on source tasks. This paper learns multiple prompts on different source tasks to encode diverse task-specific knowledge to transfer.

- Adaptive attention to select relevant prompts: Unlike methods that use a fixed prompt for new tasks, this approach attends to relevant source prompts using task- and instance-level queries for more flexible transfer.

- Evaluated on a wide set of text generation tasks: The approach is evaluated on 14 datasets spanning summarization, dialog, and story generation, demonstrating broad applicability.

- Releases source prompts as an open resource: The learned source prompts are released publicly to serve as a reusable prompt library for analyzing and improving new text generation tasks.

So in summary, this paper makes several notable contributions over prior work by proposing a novel prompt transfer framework for text generation using adaptive attention over a diverse set of learned source prompts. The comprehensive experiments and release of the prompt library are also valuable additions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Incorporating more kinds of text generation tasks. The current work focused on summarization, style transfer, dialog, and story generation. The authors suggest expanding the types of source and target text generation tasks to things like machine translation, text infilling, etc.

- Analyzing the factors that influence prompt transferability. The authors propose their source prompt library could be used as an analysis tool to study what makes prompts transferable across different text generation tasks. Things like prompt length, composition, similarity between source and target tasks could be analyzed.

- Developing methods to automate prompt clustering. Currently prompt clusters are obtained via spectral clustering on a fixed set of source tasks. More adaptive prompt clustering methods could be explored.

- Studying how to select the best source tasks to transfer from. Strategies for identifying the most relevant subset of source tasks for prompt transfer could be developed.

- Extending to cross-modal transfer scenarios. The current work focuses on transfer between text generation tasks. Transferring prompts between text, image, speech etc generation tasks could be an interesting direction.

- Developing theoretical understandings of prompt transferability. Formal theoretical analyses to provide insight into why prompt transfer works could be valuable.

So in summary, the authors point to several interesting avenues for future work to build upon their proposed prompt transfer approach for text generation. Analyzing, improving and extending prompt transfer are highlighted as key next steps.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompt-based transfer learning approach called PTG for text generation. PTG first learns a set of source prompts from representative source text generation tasks and stores them in a source prompt pool. To identify task similarity, the source prompts are clustered via spectral clustering. The prompts serve as representation bases in a multi-key memory network that can be transferred to target tasks. For a target task, PTG uses an adaptive attention mechanism with both task- and instance-level queries to retrieve the most relevant source prompts and construct a target prompt. This tailored prompt is prepended to the input text and fed into a generative PLM for text generation. Experiments on 14 datasets across compression, transduction and creation tasks demonstrate PTG's effectiveness for cross-task and cross-dataset transferability in both fully-supervised and few-shot settings compared to fine-tuning PLMs. The source prompts are released as an open resource for future reuse and analysis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompt-based transfer learning approach called PTG for text generation. PTG first learns a set of source prompts from representative source text generation tasks. These source prompts are stored in a prompt pool and grouped into clusters to identify similarity between tasks. PTG also constructs a multi-key memory network where source prompts serve as value vectors. For a new target task, PTG derives a target prompt using an adaptive attention mechanism with both task-level and instance-level queries. The task query aims to select overall relevant information while the instance query computed from the input helps attend to the most useful source prompts for a specific instance. The retrieved prompt is prepended to the input and fed into a frozen generative PLM for text generation. 

PTG is evaluated on 14 datasets over 3 types of generation tasks - compression, transduction and creation. In both fully-supervised and few-shot settings, PTG achieves competitive or better performance than fine-tuning PLMs. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of key designs like the prompt pool, prompt clusters, multi-key memory and instance-level query. A similarity analysis also shows learned prompts group tasks as expected. The source prompts are released as an open resource for future research. Overall, PTG provides an effective prompt-based transfer learning approach for data-scarce text generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel prompt-based transfer learning approach called PTG (Prompt Transfer for Text Generation) for text generation tasks. PTG first learns a set of source prompts from several representative source text generation tasks. These source prompts are stored in a prompt pool and grouped into clusters to identify similarities between tasks. PTG then transfers these source prompts as target prompts to new text generation tasks through an adaptive attention mechanism. Specifically, for each instance in the target task, PTG uses both a task-level query and an instance-level query encoded from the input to attend over the source prompts. This allows selecting the most relevant source prompts to construct a target prompt tailored for that instance. The target prompt is then prepended to the input and fed into a frozen pre-trained language model to generate the output text. So in summary, PTG transfers prompts from source to target tasks in an adaptive, instance-specific way to improve text generation performance.
