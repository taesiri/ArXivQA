# [Chain-of-Feedback: Mitigating the Effects of Inconsistency in Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02648)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT often give inconsistent responses to the same question when prompted multiple times, decreasing reliability. 
- Providing meaningless negative feedback to request another attempt makes the issue worse, causing more deviation from the correct response.
- Existing prompting methods to improve reliability have limitations around requiring curated datasets, subjective annotations, or extensive compute for model tuning.

Proposed Solution - Recursive Chain of Feedback (R-CoF):
- Break down a complex question into multiple reasoning steps. 
- Manually identify any incorrect steps.
- Prompt the LLM separately to solve only the incorrect step using the same reasoning approach.
- Recursively prompt to fix the incorrect step until the LLM provides the right response.
- Incorporate the corrected step back into the full reasoning.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate how meaningless feedback triggers more inconsistencies in LLMs
- Introduce a prompting approach to edit incorrect free responses from LLMs 
- Provide a method usable by real users without needing domain expertise or curated datasets
- Allow breaking down problems into simpler steps anyone can verify

The key insight is that recursively prompting an LLM to adjust one incorrect reasoning step at a time mitigates over-reliance on the LLM and inconsistency issues. By simplifying complex problems into verifiable steps, the approach helps guide the LLM towards reliable responses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method called Recursive Chain of Feedback (R-CoF) to mitigate the effects of inconsistency in language model responses by recursively prompting the model to fix incorrect reasoning steps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) Raising awareness of actions that trigger inconsistencies in large language models (LLMs). The paper shows through a "chain of feedback" (CoF) experiment that meaningless repetitive prompting of LLMs to request another attempt at a problem actually decreases the quality of the responses. 

2) Suggesting a new prompting method called "recursive chain of feedback" (R-CoF) for editing incorrect free responses from LLMs. This method recursively breaks down an incorrect reasoning step into smaller steps that are easier to verify as correct or not, ultimately leading the LLM towards the right solution.

3) Providing a prompting method that could be applicable to real-world use cases. R-CoF breaks problems down into simpler steps that do not require extensive domain knowledge to verify, unlike some other prompting methods. This could make it useful for people struggling with a problem and using LLMs for help.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing R-CoF as a new prompting method aimed at mitigating inconsistent responses from LLMs and leading them towards correct solutions by recursively fixing reasoning steps.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Chain-of-Feedback (CoF): A method of repetitively prompting a language model for another attempt at a question without providing meaningful feedback, showing that this leads to decreasing quality of responses.

- Recursive Chain-of-Feedback (R-CoF): A novel prompting method proposed to mitigate the issues with meaningless CoF. It involves recursively breaking down incorrect reasoning steps from a language model into smaller problems that are easier to verify and correct. 

- Inconsistency: The paper examines how language models can give inconsistent outputs despite being given the same inputs.

- Prompt engineering: The paper explores methods like CoF and R-CoF as ways to prompt language models to increase reliability and validity of their responses.

- Awareness of AI risks: The paper seeks to raise awareness about potential issues with overreliance on AI systems like conversational language models.

- Recursive prompting: R-CoF utilizes the concept of recursion to repeatedly prompt language models to fix incorrect steps in their reasoning by breaking them into simpler steps.

- Response deviation: A key finding is that meaningless feedback causes language models' responses to deviate further from the actual solutions.

So in summary - Chain-of-Feedback, Recursive Chain-of-Feedback, inconsistency, prompt engineering, awareness of AI risks, recursive prompting, response deviation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the Recursive Chain of Feedback (R-CoF) method leverage the idea of recursion to improve the accuracy of language model responses? Does it treat each reasoning step as a separate sub-problem?

2. What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of R-CoF against other prompting methods like Chain-of-Thought? Does it consider accuracy, reasoning quality, or computational efficiency? 

3. How does R-CoF identify which step in the reasoning process is incorrect? Does this require manual verification by the user or some automated method? What are the limitations?

4. Does R-CoF allow freezing the correct reasoning steps while adjusting only the incorrect ones? If so, how does this help improve the final response compared to starting over from scratch?

5. What types of questions or problem domains would be most suitable for applying the R-CoF approach? Subjective questions with no definite solutions might not work well.

6. Could R-CoF be applied recursively to break down an incorrect reasoning step into even simpler sub-steps for easier verification and adjustment? What would be the limitations here?

7. How efficient is R-CoF in terms of the number of queries needed to reach the final correct response compared to other prompting methods? There is likely a tradeoff with accuracy.  

8. Does R-CoF allow incorporating human domain knowledge at each recursion step to guide the language model? If so, does this improve results compared to fully automated recursion?

9. For mathematical problems, does R-CoF verify that intermediate expressions and calculations are correct in addition to just the final numeric solution? This could improve reasoning quality.

10. What types of sentiment analysis, if any, does R-CoF apply when requesting the language model to adjust an incorrect reasoning step? More positive sentiment may produce better revisions.
