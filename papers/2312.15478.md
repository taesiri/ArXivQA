# [A Group Fairness Lens for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15478)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT have shown concerning biases against certain social groups. Prior work has limitations in comprehensively evaluating and mitigating biases across diverse populations. 

- Specifically, existing bias evaluation methods focus on just a few dominant groups and lack a categorical perspective across multiple dimensions like gender, age, race etc. 

- Existing debiasing methods also tackle only limited target groups without considering an overarching principle like group fairness.

Solution:
- The paper proposes evaluating LLMs from a group fairness lens using a novel hierarchical schema to characterize diverse social groups along dimensions and targets. 

- Guided by this, they construct a real-world social media dataset encapsulating target-attribute combinations across multiple dimensions.

- They introduce a new open-ended text generation task called "statement organization" to uncover complex biases in LLM thinking.

- Extensive experiments on popular LLMs reveal inherent safety concerns in certain dimensions. 

- To mitigate biases, they pioneer a chain-of-thought debiasing method inspired by group fairness principles.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive group fairness perspective to evaluate and mitigate biases in LLMs

- Hierarchical schema and associated real-world social media dataset construction 

- New statement organization task for detecting subtle LLM biases

- Extensive bias analysis experiments on major LLMs  

- Novel chain-of-thought debiasing method integrating group fairness

The paper delivers important insights into assessing and reducing bias through a multidimensional group fairness lens to promote equity in LLM development.
