# [Sign Language Translation with Iterative Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12191)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve sign language translation performance by introducing an iterative refinement process to enhance the semantic representation (prototype) of the input sign language video. The key hypothesis is that repeatedly refining the prototype by aggregating it with the original visual features will allow it to converge to a more accurate representation of the semantic meaning, leading to higher quality translation output.Specifically, the paper proposes an Iterative Prototype Sign Language Translation (IP-SLT) framework that incorporates:- An initialization module to generate an initial prototype and translation - An iterative refinement module that repeatedly updates the prototype by attending over the original visual features- An iterative distillation loss to leverage the dependence between prototypesThe central hypothesis is that this iterative refinement of the prototype will bridge the vision-text gap and improve translation performance. The experiments aim to validate whether this iterative approach can boost performance over standard encoder-decoder SLT systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes IP-SLT, a novel framework to improve sign language translation by introducing an iterative prototype refinement process. - It presents an iterative refinement module that repeatedly aggregates the previous prototype and original visual features to obtain a more accurate prototype.- It introduces an iterative distillation loss to leverage the dependence between outputs of different iterations.- It achieves improved performance on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed iterative refinement process and distillation loss.Overall, the key novelty is the iterative refinement framework for sign language translation, which mimics human reading behavior to gradually improve the semantic prototype. The iterative distillation loss further enhances the refinement process.
