# [EAGLE: A Domain Generalization Framework for AI-generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being used to generate high-quality text that can potentially spread misinformation if used maliciously. However, existing AI-generated text detectors rely on labeled data from the target LLM generator, which is infeasible to obtain for every new LLM released.  

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes EAGLE, a novel domain generalization framework to detect text from unseen target LLMs. EAGLE leverages labeled data from older, smaller LLMs to learn features that are invariant across LLMs.

Key Components of EAGLE:
- Classification backbone using RoBERTa language model to extract text embeddings
- Domain adversarial training using gradient reversal layer to learn domain-invariant features
- Contrastive loss to improve text representations and be robust to perturbations

Experiments and Results:
- Tested on benchmark dataset TuringBench covering 19 generators + newly generated GPT-4 news data
- Outperforms unsupervised baselines like GLTR and DetectGPT in detecting unseen target generators
- Achieves strong performance in detecting text from new SOTA models like GPT-4 and Claude without using any data from them for training
- Ablations show both contrastive loss and domain adversarial components are important

Main Contributions:
- First framework to tackle domain generalization for AI-text detection using older LLM data
- Shows possibility of detecting text from new LLMs by transferring knowledge from older, smaller LLMs 
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating efficacy on variety of new and old generators
- New GPT-4 generated news dataset that will be released

Overall, the paper makes an important step towards building AI-text detectors that can generalize to emerging LLMs in a practical manner by relying on available old data.
