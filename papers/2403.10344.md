## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods struggle to reconstruct large, unbounded, and highly detailed urban outdoor scenes from images. They require additional supervision data like LiDAR, strong geometric priors, and long training times to achieve accurate reconstructions of such complex scenes. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new hybrid implicit learning method called SCILLA to reconstruct large urban driving scenes from only 2D images.

Key aspects of SCILLA:

- Hybrid architecture with two MLPs modeling two implicit fields - one for volumetric density and one for signed distance to the surface.

- Novel volume rendering approach that relies on self-supervised density estimation to sample points near the surface. It progressively transitions from volumetric representation to surface representation.

- Does not rely on geometric priors or assumptions about scene topology, making it more flexible.

- Employs techniques like probability-based sample attribution and SDF gradient normalization to facilitate convergence.

Main Contributions:

- Accurate and detailed 3D surface reconstruction of urban driving scenes from only 2D images, without need for additional supervision.

- Novel hybrid architecture and rendering approach to transition smoothly from density-based to surface-based representation.

- Self-supervised technique for sampling points near surface speeds up training.

- Reconstruction quality on par or better than state-of-the-art, with just half the training time.

- Extensive experiments validate performance on multiple driving datasets like KITTI, Pandaset, Waymo and nuScenes.

In summary, the paper presents a method to efficiently and accurately reconstruct 3D urban driving scenes from 2D images alone using a hybrid implicit learning approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

SCILLA is a hybrid implicit surface learning method for accurately and efficiently reconstructing large urban driving scenes from 2D images through modeling separate volumetric density and signed distance fields, a novel volume rendering approach with progressive sampling, and regularizations to facilitate convergence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel hybrid implicit learning method called SCILLA for surface reconstruction of large outdoor driving scenes from 2D images. 

2. A hybrid architecture that models two separate implicit fields - one for volumetric density and one for signed distance to the surface.

3. A new volume rendering technique that relies on self-supervised probabilistic density estimation to sample points near the surface and smoothly transition from volumetric to surface representation, reducing training time.

4. Various regularization techniques for the signed distance field to enhance implicit surface learning and convergence.

5. Extensive experiments on four outdoor driving datasets demonstrating SCILLA's ability to efficiently and accurately reconstruct urban outdoor scenarios with higher quality than previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key innovation is the hybrid architecture and volume rendering strategy that allows fast and accurate 3D surface reconstruction of large, unbounded driving scenes from 2D images alone.
