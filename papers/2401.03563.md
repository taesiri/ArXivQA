# [Data-CUBE: Data Curriculum for Instruction-based Sentence Representation   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Instruction-based sentence representation models trained with multi-task contrastive learning suffer from interference issues across different tasks and instances. 
- This interference impedes the model from properly fitting the training data, leading to suboptimal performance and underfitting issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose Data-CUBE, a data curriculum method to minimize interference in instruction-based sentence representation learning. It involves:

1) Task-level curriculum: 
- Estimate cross-task interference risk based on task representation similarity.
- Use simulated annealing to find optimal task order that minimizes total risk.

2) Instance-level curriculum:
- Measure instance difficulty based on discrimination of positives and negatives.  
- Sort instances from easy to difficult within each task.

- After arranging tasks and instances, split data into mini-batches for training.

Main Contributions:
- First work to apply data curriculum for instruction-based sentence representations to address interference. 
- Propose a two-level curriculum method at both task and instance levels using simulated annealing and instance difficulty measurement.
- Experiments show consistent performance boosts over strong baselines on sentence representation tasks, with reduced underfitting.
- Approach is model-agnostic and avoids extra training costs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Data-CUBE, a data curriculum method that arranges the order of tasks and instances in multi-task instruction-based sentence representation learning to minimize cross-task and cross-instance interference risks, improving model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Data-CUBE, a data curriculum method for multi-task instruction-based sentence representation learning. Specifically, Data-CUBE arranges the order of tasks and instances before training to minimize the potential interference risks across different tasks and instances with large divergence. This is achieved by:

1) Using a simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal task order that minimizes the total cross-task interference risk. 

2) Measuring the instance difficulty within each task and dividing instances into easy-to-difficult mini-batches to reduce the cross-instance interference risk.

Experiments show that Data-CUBE can boost the performance of state-of-the-art instruction-based sentence representation models on downstream tasks, even outperforming larger models trained on much more data. The analysis also reveals that Data-CUBE alleviates the underfitting issue and helps the model learn more effectively.
