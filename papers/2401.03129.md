# [Examining Forgetting in Continual Pre-training of Aligned Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks and continually pre-training them on new data is a common practice. However, continual pre-training can lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned capabilities.
- There is limited understanding of the abilities forgotten during continual pre-training of existing fine-tuned LLMs. 

Proposed Solution and Contributions:
- The paper investigates forgetting during continual pre-training of Llama-2-7b-chat, an existing fine-tuned LLM, on 1B tokens of Traditional Chinese data. 
- It evaluates the impact across output format, knowledge retention, and reliability through language ID, repetition rate, commonsense reasoning, multitask accuracy, truthfulness, toxicity, and bias benchmarks.
- Key findings:
   - Models prone to generate Chinese outputs exhibit higher repetition rates, especially with Chinese prompts.  
   - Knowledge remains largely unaffected but reliability declines after continual pre-training.
   - Straightforward approaches like freezing layers/modules or using adapters are insufficient to mitigate forgetting.
- The analysis highlights that catastrophic forgetting in continual pre-training of fine-tuned LLMs is a non-trivial issue requiring more advanced solutions.
- The work focuses on continual pre-training in Chinese but provides a methodology adaptable to other languages and downstream tasks.

In summary, the paper demonstrates and systematically analyzes catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training of fine-tuned LLMs, using Llama-2-7b-chat and a Chinese corpus as a case study. It shows that this is a challenging problem and straightforward approaches fall short. The analysis methodology can inform further research on mitigating forgetting in LLMs undergoing continual learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper examines catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training of aligned large language models, finding it leads to issues like increased text repetition and declining reliability, especially when generating Traditional Chinese outputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It examines the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting that occurs during continual pre-training on an existing fine-tuned large language model (LLM). Specifically, it studies the impact of continual pre-training using a Traditional Chinese corpus on an LLM that has already undergone sequential alignment operations like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.

2) It evaluates the effects of continual pre-training across various dimensions like output format, knowledge, and reliability of the LLM. Experiments are conducted using straightforward approaches like freezing layers or modules of the LLM, as well as adapter methods.

3) The results demonstrate that catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training is a non-trivial issue that cannot be easily resolved with straightforward approaches. Notably, models inclined to generate Traditional Chinese outputs exhibit increased text repetition issues. 

4) Although the continual pre-trained models show unaffected or slightly improved performance on knowledge benchmarks, their reliability in terms of truthfulness, toxicity and bias declines compared to the original fine-tuned LLM.

In summary, the key contribution is an in-depth investigation and analysis of the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon when an existing fine-tuned LLM undergoes further continual pre-training. The results highlight important trade-offs between knowledge and reliability that need to be addressed.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper examines catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training on an existing fine-tuned LLM. What are some key challenges and limitations surrounding continual pre-training that lead to this catastrophic forgetting? 

2. The paper evaluates the impact of continual pre-training across output format, knowledge, and reliability. In the output format analysis, what factors contribute to the increased prominence of the repetition problem when models generate more Traditional Chinese text?

3. Regarding the straightforward approaches explored, why does freezing certain layers or modules not effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting? What architectural considerations should be accounted for? 

4. For the adapter methods Lora and (Ia)3 tested, how do the different operating mechanisms of these adapters impact mitigating forgetting and retaining specialized knowledge? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The knowledge analysis results show limited differences between the continually pre-trained models and baseline Llama-2-7b-chat. Why does continual pre-training seem to not affect model knowledge substantially?  

6. In examining model reliability after continual pre-training, what factors cause the model's truthfulness and lack of toxicity to decline? How might this be addressed?

7. The paper focuses on pre-training using a Traditional Chinese corpus. How might the observations change if the pre-training corpus was in another language like Japanese or Spanish instead?

8. What data augmentation or regularization techniques could be incorporated during continual pre-training to better retain existing specialized knowledge and mitigate forgetting? 

9. How can an improved prompting methodology better analyze model knowledge retention versus forgetting after continual pre-training? What prompt optimizations should be explored?  

10. The paper conducts analysis using specific datasets for knowledge, truthfulness, toxicity, and bias. How could the analysis approach be expanded to use more diverse datasets to evaluate retention versus forgetting?
