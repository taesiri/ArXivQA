# [ROSE: A Recognition-Oriented Speech Enhancement Framework in Air Traffic   Control Using Multi-Objective Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06118)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a recognition-oriented speech enhancement (ROSE) framework to improve both speech intelligibility and ASR performance in air traffic control scenarios. A key challenge is removing the radio speech echo that degrades speech quality and impacts ASR accuracy. ROSE uses an encoder-decoder U-Net architecture operating directly on the time-domain waveform to eliminate the echo. Two novel components are an attention-based skip-fusion (ABSF) mechanism to refine fused features and a channel and sequence attention (CSAtt) block to focus on informative features and suppress disturbance. Multi-objective learning optimizes both SE-related losses (time-domain and spectral magnitude losses) as well as ASR-related losses based on spectral convergence to retain ASR performance without retraining models. Experiments on a real-world air traffic control corpus demonstrate ROSE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both speech enhancement metrics and ASR label error rate reduction. Additional experiments on public datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the approach. Key innovations include directly modeling the raw waveform, jointly optimizing for SE and ASR, and the proposed attention mechanisms.
