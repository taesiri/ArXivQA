# [ROSE: A Recognition-Oriented Speech Enhancement Framework in Air Traffic   Control Using Multi-Objective Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06118)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a recognition-oriented speech enhancement (ROSE) framework to improve both speech intelligibility and ASR performance in air traffic control scenarios. A key challenge is removing the radio speech echo that degrades speech quality and impacts ASR accuracy. ROSE uses an encoder-decoder U-Net architecture operating directly on the time-domain waveform to eliminate the echo. Two novel components are an attention-based skip-fusion (ABSF) mechanism to refine fused features and a channel and sequence attention (CSAtt) block to focus on informative features and suppress disturbance. Multi-objective learning optimizes both SE-related losses (time-domain and spectral magnitude losses) as well as ASR-related losses based on spectral convergence to retain ASR performance without retraining models. Experiments on a real-world air traffic control corpus demonstrate ROSE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both speech enhancement metrics and ASR label error rate reduction. Additional experiments on public datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the approach. Key innovations include directly modeling the raw waveform, jointly optimizing for SE and ASR, and the proposed attention mechanisms.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In air traffic control (ATC) communications, a specific phenomenon called "speech echo" degrades speech quality and impacts automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. Speech echo refers to the overlapping of a controller's sent and received speech signals due to radio transmission procedures, resulting in redundant echo interference. This is a major issue limiting ASR performance in ATC environments.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a recognition-oriented speech enhancement (ROSE) framework to eliminate speech echo and improve speech intelligibility and ASR accuracy, without needing to retrain ASR models. ROSE uses an encoder-decoder U-Net architecture operating directly on the speech waveform, along with two key components:

1) An attention-based skip-fusion (ABSF) block to refine features passed through the U-Net skips. This prevents direct concatenation of hierarchical features.

2) A channel and sequence attention (CSAtt) block to focus the model on informative features and suppress disturbances, through parallel channel and sequence attention paths.

ROSE is trained with a multi-objective loss function combining speech enhancement and ASR-related objectives. This learns shared representations beneficial for both tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an end-to-end model to eliminate challenging radio speech echo in ATC, improving speech quality and ASR accuracy without ASR retraining.

- Applies multi-objective learning to learn joint speech enhancement and ASR representations in a shared model. 

- Designs two specialized model components, ABSF and CSAtt, to refine learned features.

- Shows state-of-the-art performance on a real-world ATC corpus, and generalizability to public datasets. Outperforms existing speech enhancement methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a recognition-oriented speech enhancement framework called ROSE based on multi-objective learning to eliminate radio speech echo in air traffic control and improve speech intelligibility and automatic speech recognition accuracy without needing to retrain the ASR model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) An end-to-end deep architecture called ROSE (recognition-oriented speech enhancement) is proposed to eliminate radio speech echo in air traffic control and improve speech intelligibility and automatic speech recognition accuracy, without requiring retraining of the ASR model. 

2) Multi-objective learning is applied to learn shared representations across the speech enhancement and automatic speech recognition objectives. This is done by incorporating both time-frequency losses for speech enhancement and Fourier-based losses for retaining ASR performance.

3) An attention-based skip-fusion (ABSF) mechanism and a channel and sequence attention (CSAtt) block are proposed to refine features and focus on informative representations while suppressing disturbances. 

4) Experimental results show that ROSE significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both speech enhancement and ASR tasks for the real-world air traffic control corpus as well as public datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel ROSE framework with multi-objective learning and attention mechanisms to effectively eliminate speech echo in air traffic control scenarios and improve both speech enhancement and automatic speech recognition performance.
