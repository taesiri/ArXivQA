# [Marathon: A Race Through the Realm of Long Context with Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09542)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models' long context understanding are becoming insufficient as model contexts grow larger. 
- Long context reasoning is crucial for language models but current benchmarks have limitations in accurately assessing this capability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a new long context benchmark called "Marathon" with multiple choice questions over contexts from 60k to 260k+ words.
- It has 6 tasks: Comprehension & Reasoning, Multiple Information Retrieval, Timeline Reorder, Computation, Passage Retrieval, Short Dependency QA.
- The tasks aim to test understanding, reasoning and information retrieval from long contexts.

Key Contributions:
- Marathon provides a fresh suite of long context tasks to evaluate language models. 
- Several latest large language models and context compression methods are evaluated on Marathon to demonstrate its usefulness.
- The results highlight current models still need improvement in long context reasoning, with a 7B model outperforming a 70B model.
- Context compression methods and retrieval augmented generation are shown to help for some cases but also have limitations.
- Overall, Marathon enables more accurate assessment of long context capabilities compared to existing benchmarks.

The paper introduces Marathon as an effective new benchmark for the crucial capability of long context reasoning and understanding in large language models. Experimental results demonstrate Marathon can reveal strengths and weaknesses of current models in handling long contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The proposal of a new long context benchmark called Marathon for evaluating the long context understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models. Marathon contains 6 tasks with over 1500 test cases and context lengths ranging from 60k to 260k+ tokens.

2) Evaluations of several latest large language models as well as 3 recent long context optimization methods on the proposed Marathon benchmark. This benchmarks their capabilities for long context reasoning and comprehension.

3) Analysis showing that retrieval augmented generation methods outperform prompt compression methods for handling long contexts. The embeddings based retrieval method using Jina performed the best overall.  

4) Identification of issues with following instructions for some models, even though they perform well on question answering. For example, models like Yi and Beluga had good performance on QA but poor ability to respond in the JSON format as instructed.

5) Discussion of trends and future directions like online benchmarks, document based contexts, and leveraging community effort for continuously updated evaluation of large language models.

The key novelty is the new Marathon benchmark and analysis of various models and optimization methods for long context understanding using this benchmark.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new long context benchmark called Marathon. What are some key advantages of using a multiple choice format for evaluating long context understanding compared to methods that generate free-form responses?

2. The paper constructs distractor options using GPT-4 applied to shortened contexts. What potential issues could arise from this approach and how might the authors mitigate them? 

3. For the Passage Retrieval task, the authors acknowledge limitations of using existing data from Longbench. What specific limitations exist and what strategies could the authors use to create improved data for this task?

4. The LongLLMLingua compression method is found to hurt performance for several models. What factors may explain why compression helps certain models but harms others? How could the compression approach be refined?

5. Embedding-based retrieval is found more effective than compression. However, both still show limitations on tasks like Timeline Reorder and Computation. Why might these tasks be inherently more challenging? How could retrieval be tailored to better assist with them?

6. The paper identifies instruction following as an issue for many models. What underlying model architectures or training procedures may contribute to poor performance on this? How could it be improved?  

7. The paper suggests online collaborative benchmark development may be beneficial. What are some key challenges that would need to be addressed to enable effective community-driven benchmark creation at scale?

8. JSON format response and knowledge retrieval are noted as emerging capabilities for models like GPT-4. How will benchmarks need to evolve to properly evaluate these features as they continue maturing? 

9. Ablation studies analyze individual model components like parameter count and context window size. What other model architecture variations would be informative to study in terms of long context understanding?

10. Beyond the methods studied here, what other promising techniques could be evaluated by extending the Marathon benchmark, either proposed in existing literature or yet to be developed?


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Marathon, a new long context benchmark consisting of multiple choice questions across 6 tasks, and uses it to evaluate several large language models and long context optimization methods, finding that retrieval augmented generation outperforms compression and most models still struggle with long context reasoning.
