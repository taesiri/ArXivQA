# [Rehearsal-Free Domain Continual Face Anti-Spoofing: Generalize More and   Forget Less](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09914)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It addresses the problem of face anti-spoofing (FAS) under the setting of domain continual learning (DCL). The goal is to enable FAS models to continually evolve when encountering new data domains, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous domains.

- The main research questions/hypotheses are:

1) How to efficiently adapt FAS models to new domains with only a small amount of new training data, without accessing previous data? 

2) How to improve the model's generalization capability to unseen domains?

3) How to alleviate catastrophic forgetting of previous domains during continual learning, without storing previous data?

- To address these questions, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a Dynamic Central Difference Convolutional Adapter (DCDCA) to efficiently adapt Vision Transformer models to new domains by extracting fine-grained features.

2) A Proxy Prototype Contrastive Regularization method to improve generalization and reduce forgetting by constraining the model with "pseudo" prototypes from previous domains. 

3) Extensive experiments on 15 datasets showing the proposed method generalizes better on unseen domains and forgets less compared to baselines.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that by designing a more adaptive and generalizable model architecture, along with a regularization method using proxy prototypes, one can achieve better generalization and less forgetting in the challenging problem setting of rehearsal-free DCL for FAS. The experiments seem to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new approach for face anti-spoofing under the domain continual learning setting, where the model needs to adapt to new domains sequentially with only limited data, without catastrophically forgetting previous domains. The main contributions are:

1. They formulate and tackle the face anti-spoofing problem under a practical but challenging scenario of low-shot and rehearsal-free domain continual learning. 

2. They design a Dynamic Central Difference Convolutional Adapter (DCDCA) to efficiently adapt Vision Transformer models to extract fine-grained features for face anti-spoofing in continual domains.

3. They propose a Proxy Prototype Contrastive Regularization method to improve generalization and alleviate catastrophic forgetting during continual learning, without needing to store or reuse previous data.

4. They evaluate the method on two new protocols covering 15 diverse datasets with 2D and 3D attacks. Results show their method can improve generalization on unseen domains and reduce forgetting of previous knowledge compared to baselines.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a new rehearsal-free approach to adapt face anti-spoofing models efficiently in practical domain continual learning settings, through architectural design and regularization methods. The experiments demonstrate improved generalization and anti-forgetting ability over strong baselines.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a rehearsal-free domain continual learning method for face anti-spoofing that improves generalization to unseen domains and reduces catastrophic forgetting of previous domains by using a dynamic central difference convolutional adapter and proxy prototype contrastive regularization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on rehearsal-free domain continual face anti-spoofing compares to other related work:

- This paper tackles face anti-spoofing (FAS) in a domain continual learning setting, where the model needs to adapt to new domains sequentially with limited data, without forgetting previous knowledge. This is more practical but less studied than traditional cross-domain FAS settings.

- Existing continual learning methods for FAS rely on storing data from previous domains to replay for rehearsal when learning new domains. This paper proposes the first rehearsal-free method that does not require previous data storage due to privacy concerns with facial images.

- To adapt models efficiently without overfitting on limited data, this paper utilizes adapter modules rather than fine-tuning the whole model like prior arts. The proposed dynamic convolutional adapter can extract intrinsic live/spoof cues.

- While common regularization techniques like EWC focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting, this paper also considers improving generalization to unseen domains via contrastive learning and proxy prototypes, which is ignored by prior domain continual learning works.

- Extensive experiments are conducted on 15 diverse public datasets covering various 2D and 3D attacks. Two new protocols are designed to evaluate both generalization and anti-forgetting capacities in the continual setting.

- Compared to baselines like ResNet and vanilla ViT adapters, the proposed method achieves significantly better generalization on unseen domains and less forgetting of previous knowledge on the two protocols.

In summary, this paper addresses a more practical but challenging problem setting for FAS, and proposes a novel rehearsal-free continual learning approach utilizing efficient adapter modules and proxy-based contrastive regularization to achieve better generalization and alleviate forgetting. The extensive experiments on diverse datasets also push the research boundary of continual cross-domain FAS.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more sophisticated methods for domain adaptation without the need for source domain data or labels during adaptation. The authors propose using the model weights as a proxy for source data, but suggest exploring other approaches that do not rely on previous model weights. 

- Exploring how to better balance generalization performance and avoiding catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings. The authors propose methods to improve both, but note there is a tradeoff between the two goals. More research could aim to optimize for both simultaneously.

- Applying the ideas to other vision tasks beyond face anti-spoofing, such as general object recognition. The methods proposed are designed for FAS but may be applicable to other areas.

- Scaling up the methods to handle larger models and more complex datasets. The experiments are limited to certain model sizes and datasets, so testing the approaches with larger models and more diverse/complex data could be valuable.

- Reducing the computational overhead of the methods to make them more efficient. The dynamic adapters and contrastive regularization add some computational costs, so finding ways to streamline them could help with real-world deployment.

- Exploring different regularization techniques for continual learning. The paper uses proxy prototypes for regularization, but notes many other methods exist that could be tailored and evaluated for this problem setting.

- Developing better protocols and metrics for continually evaluated FAS models. The authors design new protocols, but note there is still room for improvement in benchmarking methods in this area.

So in summary, the authors lay out a research agenda focused on advancing domain adaptation, continual learning, and evaluation protocols related to the face anti-spoofing problem and beyond. Their methods make some initial progress but they outline many promising directions for building on their work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for face anti-spoofing in a domain continual learning setting without needing to store previous data. The method adapts Vision Transformer (ViT) models using a Dynamic Central Difference Convolutional Adapter (DCDCA) to extract fine-grained features to discriminate between real and spoof faces. To improve generalization and reduce forgetting during continual learning, a Proxy Prototype Contrastive Regularization (PPCR) is proposed. PPCR uses the weights of the classifier head as proxy prototypes to regularize the model to cluster features of the same class together across domains without accessing previous data directly. Experiments on two new continual learning protocols with 15 datasets show the method can improve generalization to unseen domains while forgetting less knowledge compared to baselines. The key ideas are adapting ViT efficiently for anti-spoofing with DCDCA and regularizing the model to extract generalized features across domains with PPCR to achieve better continual learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach for face anti-spoofing in a domain continual learning setting. The goal is to develop a model that can continually learn from new domains without forgetting previous knowledge, while also generalizing well to unseen domains. 

The authors introduce a Dynamic Central Difference Convolutional Adapter (DCDCA) to efficiently adapt vision transformer models for continual learning of new domains with only a small amount of training data. DCDCA adapts the model by integrating local descriptors and central difference convolution to extract fine-grained features for discrimination. They also propose a Proxy Prototype Contrastive Regularization method to reduce catastrophic forgetting during continual learning by using previous domain knowledge approximated from model weights as prototypes for contrastive learning on new domains. Experiments on two continual learning protocols with 15 public datasets demonstrate that their proposed approach achieves better generalization on unseen domains and less forgetting of previous domains compared to baseline methods. The adaptable DCDCA architecture and regularization method are effective for domain continual learning in face anti-spoofing without requiring storage of previous data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a rehearsal-free domain continual learning method for face anti-spoofing. The method incorporates two main components: 1) A Dynamic Central Difference Convolutional Adapter (DCDCA) that adapts a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to extract fine-grained features and provide image-specific inductive bias via convolution operations and adaptive central difference information. The DCDCA helps the model generalize better to unseen domains. 2) A Proxy Prototype Contrastive Regularization (PPCR) that regularizes feature clustering during training without accessing previous data. The PPCR utilizes previous domain knowledge approximated from the prototypes in the model's classifier weights as anchors to reduce forgetting of previous domains. Experiments on two continual learning protocols with 15 datasets demonstrate the method can achieve better generalization performance on unseen domains while forgetting less knowledge of previous domains compared to baseline methods.
