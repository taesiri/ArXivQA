# [Open-Source Reinforcement Learning Environments Implemented in MuJoCo   with Franka Manipulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for solving complex robot manipulation tasks. However, contact-rich tasks and reward engineering remain challenging. Realistic simulation environments can help bridge the sim-to-real gap before deployment in the real world.  
- Existing simulation environments have limitations - they use simplified robot models, lack diversity of manipulation tasks, or do not fully leverage the capabilities of physics engines like MuJoCo.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes 3 new open-source RL environments - FrankaPush, FrankaSlide and FrankaPickAndPlace - using the Franka robot model from MuJoCo Menagerie and the MuJoCo physics engine.
- The tasks follow the multi-goal RL framework with customizable reward functions. The observation space contains achieved and desired goals.
- Environments are defined clearly in separate XML documents with tunable simulation parameters. This allows flexibility for further developments.

Main Contributions:
- Realistic manipulation environments utilizing MuJoCo's high fidelity physics and an accurate Franka model
- Implementation of 3 continuous control tasks of varying complexity - push, slide and pick-and-place
- Benchmark results using off-policy RL algorithms DDPG, SAC and TQC demonstrating the feasibility of training agents in these environments
- Reproducible set-ups with customizable modules to enable extensions with new tasks, robots and end-effectors

In summary, the paper contributes open-source, flexible and reusable robot manipulation environments to the RL research community for prototyping algorithms before real world deployment. The physics accuracy and modularity should help narrow the reality gap.
