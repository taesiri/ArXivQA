# [Families of costs with zero and nonnegative MTW tensor in optimal   transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00953)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies the regularity of optimal transport maps between probability measures on manifolds. Regularity is governed by the Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) tensor or cross curvature. 
- The goal is to find new cost functions with nonnegative or zero MTW tensor. This gives regular optimal maps. Prior works found costs based on Euclidean distance and logarithmic functions.

Main Contributions:

1) Derives formula for MTW tensor for cost functions of the form c(x,y)=u(x^T Ay) from R^n to R, where A is a fixed matrix. Shows it satisfies a nonlinear ODE when vanishing on null vectors.

2) Provides 3 families of solutions to this ODE that yield zero MTW tensor costs. These include generalized hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. Makes connection to known costs like Euclidean and log types.

3) Analyzes similar costs adapted to sphere and hyperboloid models. Using Gauss-Codazzi equations, derives criteria for positive MTW tensor. 

4) Gives new strictly regular cost examples for these manifolds, including power functions and sinh-type costs. Computes associated optimal maps.

5) Studies a sub-family of sinh-type costs. Provides absolutely homogeneous convex functions that are c-convex. Constructs a c-divergence formula.

To summarize, the paper derives new zero and positive MTW tensor costs for Euclidean spaces and spherical/hyperbolic manifolds. This yields regular optimal transport maps. It also studies properties of a sinh-type cost family.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper computes the Ma-Trudinger-Wang tensor for optimal transport costs of the form $\mathsf{c}(x,y)=\mathsf{u}(x^\mathsf{T}Ay)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, the sphere, and the hyperboloid, obtaining new families of costs with nonnegative and zero tensor, including generalized hyperbolic and Lambert function costs, and analyzes properties like the optimal map and c-convexity for a $\sinh$-type cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It derives a formula for the Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) tensor for cost functions of the form c(x,y) = u(x^T Ay) on Euclidean space, where u is a scalar function and A is a symmetric nondegenerate matrix. It shows the condition for the MTW tensor to vanish is a fourth order nonlinear ODE in the inverse function s of u.

2) It provides several new families of cost functions on Euclidean space, the sphere and hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry that have zero or positive MTW tensor. These include generalized hyperbolic/trigonometric functions and their inverses. 

3) For a "sinh-like" cost function on hyperbolic space, it constructs new examples of c-convex functions and analyzes the associated c-divergence. 

4) It links the classical Euclidean distance cost and log-type costs as special cases of the more general cost families with zero MTW tensor.

So in summary, the main contribution is deriving new cost functions with favorable regularity properties based on the MTW tensor, enabled by an explicit formula relating the tensor to the cost function. This also makes new connections between previously known costs.

The paper derives conditions and provides new examples of cost functions on Euclidean space, spheres, and hyperbolic spaces that have zero or positive cross curvature/MTW tensor.

The relationship to Bregmann divergence and connections to information geometry are discussed. Overall, the key focus is constructing and analyzing regular cost functions in optimal transport using differential geometric tools.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new family of cost functions on Euclidean space with zero MTW tensor. What is the significance of having a zero MTW tensor? How does it impact the regularity of the optimal transport map?

2. The paper shows the zero MTW condition leads to a specific fourth order ODE. Can you explain the derivation of this ODE starting from the expression for the MTW tensor? What key insights allowed reducing it to an ODE?  

3. The solutions to the fourth order ODE include generalized hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions. Can you give some intuition why these naturally emerge from requiring a zero MTW tensor? Do they have any practical advantages?

4. For the sphere and hyperboloid models, the paper uses the Gauss-Codazzi equations to compute the MTW tensor. Can you explain the key ideas behind this approach and why it is suited for these manifolds? 

5. The paper introduces some new families of cost functions that satisfy the MTW conditions on the sphere and hyperboloid. Can you discuss one of these families in depth - how it is constructed, what assumptions are needed, and what insights allowed finding it?

6. For the $\sinh$-type hyperbolic cost, the paper discusses $\bcc$-convex functions and a divergence measure. Can you explain how these connect back to the optimal transport problem? What practical utility do they have?

7. The generalized hyperbolic divergence proposed resembles a Bregman divergence. What similarities and differences are there? When might this new divergence be useful compared to a Bregman divergence?

8. The expressions for the optimal maps for the new costs involve generalized hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions. What numerical challenges might there be in implementing and using these maps in practice?

9. The paper focuses on costs functions of the form $\bu(x^{\ft}y)$. What are some other promising classes of cost functions one could investigate that might lead to useful new examples?

10. The zero/positive MTW condition impacts regularity of optimal maps. How might the results of this paper extend to studying higher order regularity of optimal transport?
