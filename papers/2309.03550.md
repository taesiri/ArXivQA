# [Text2Control3D: Controllable 3D Avatar Generation in Neural Radiance   Fields using Geometry-Guided Text-to-Image Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03550)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate controllable 3D avatar models from text descriptions and casual monocular video inputs?Specifically, the paper proposes a method called Text2Control3D to generate 3D avatar models that reflect given text descriptions and facial expressions/geometry from monocular video frames. The key aspects are:1) Generating viewpoint-aware avatar images using a text-to-image diffusion model conditioned on depth maps from the video. This allows controlling the avatar's facial expressions.2) Proposing cross-reference attention and low-pass filtering of latents to improve consistency of facial expressions and appearance across the generated viewpoint images.3) Reconstructing the final controllable 3D avatar model in a canonical space using deformable Neural Radiance Fields, interpreting inconsistencies across views as deformations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by generating controlled viewpoint images and reconstructing them in a deformable 3D space, they can produce high-quality and controllable text-to-3D avatars from casual monocular video inputs. The experiments and comparisons aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for controllable text-to-3D avatar generation, where the facial expression of the generated 3D avatar can be controlled by a monocular video input. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. This is the first work to enable controllable text-to-3D avatar generation using a text-to-image diffusion model. 2. Proposing cross-reference attention, which allows generating a consistent set of viewpoint-aware avatar images with controlled facial expressions and appearance from the diffusion model.3. Observing and ameliorating the texture-sticking problem in conditional image generation from diffusion models.4. A method to reconstruct a high-fidelity 3D avatar from the generated set of viewpoint-aware images by modeling geometric inconsistencies as deformations from a canonical 3D space.In summary, the main contribution is enabling controllable text-to-3D avatar generation by enhancing text-to-image diffusion models to generate consistent viewpoint-aware images and using those images to reconstruct a deformable 3D avatar model. The proposed method outperforms existing text-to-3D generation baselines in terms of controllability over facial expressions and visual quality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Text2Control3D, a novel method to generate controllable 3D avatars from text descriptions and monocular videos by generating viewpoint-aware images with ControlNet enhanced with cross-reference attention and low-pass filtering of latents, then reconstructing the avatar in deformable Neural Radiance Fields to handle geometric inconsistencies.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on controllable text-to-3D generation:- This is the first work I'm aware of that tackles controllable text-to-3D avatar generation using a text-to-image diffusion model. Most prior work has focused on text-to-image generation or unconditional text-to-3D generation, but not controllable text-to-3D. So this paper presents a novel approach.- Compared to unconditional text-to-3D methods like DreamFusion, this paper achieves much better control over facial expressions and geometry by leveraging the controllability of ControlNet. The user study and qualitative results demonstrate the improvements in controllability.- The proposed cross-reference attention is a nice way to induce consistent facial expressions across generated viewpoint images. This idea of attending to a reference image seems applicable to other conditional image generation tasks as well. - The analysis and mitigation of the texture-sticking problem is another innovation of this work. Identifying that high frequencies in the latent cause this issue, and removing them with low-pass filtering, seems to be an effective solution.- Using deformable NeRF to account for geometric inconsistencies between the generated images is clever. Interpreting the differences as deformations from a canonical space makes sense intuitively.- Compared to image-to-3D methods like Instruct-NeRF2NeRF, this paper's approach of generating intermediate images allows leveraging state-of-the-art text-to-image models like ControlNet. The results appear higher-quality than directly translating NeRF to NeRF.Overall, I think this paper makes several novel contributions in terms of techniques and the new task formulation. The results demonstrate a clear improvement over other text-to-3D approaches in terms of control and quality. It's an exciting direction for future work on controllable generative 3D avatars.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improvements in the controllability of ControlNet for generating reference images with a wider range of facial expressions. The authors note that ControlNet often fails to generate uncommon expressions like closed or winked eyes. Enhancing ControlNet's controllability would directly improve the facial expression scope for controllable avatar generation.- Exploring alternative 3D representations beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While the authors use NeRF, they note it has limitations like slow rendering speeds. Future work could examine other 3D representations.- Higher resolution generation. The current method generates 512x512 images as an intermediate step before 3D avatar construction. Generating higher resolution images could further improve avatar visual quality.- Video avatar generation. The current method takes a casually captured monocular video as input. Extending to generate controllable avatar videos from monocular video inputs could be valuable.- Textural consistency and realism. While the authors propose techniques to ameliorate texture sticking issues, further improving textural consistency and realism remains an open challenge.- Large-scale training. The authors use a relatively small custom dataset. Training on larger and more diverse datasets could enhance avatar generation quality and diversity.- Applications such as virtual assistants, digital humans, VR avatars, and gaming. The authors focus on the technical generation pipeline, but do not explore potential applications, which could be interesting future work.In summary, the key suggestions are improving ControlNet controllability, exploring new 3D representations, generating higher resolution and video avatars, enhancing textural consistency, leveraging larger datasets, and examining downstream applications. Advancing these aspects could significantly expand the capabilities and utility of controllable text-to-3D avatar generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Text2Control3D, a method for controllable text-to-3D avatar generation using a text-to-image diffusion model. The goal is to generate a 3D facial avatar with controllable facial expressions and shape from a casual monocular video and text description. The method first extracts depth maps from the video which serve as viewpoint-aware conditions for generating a set of avatar images using ControlNet. Two modifications are made to ControlNet - cross-reference attention is used to inject consistent facial expressions/appearance across generated images, and low-pass filtering of the Gaussian latent ameliorates texture sticking. The resulting viewpoint-aware but geometrically inconsistent images are used to reconstruct a 3D avatar in a canonical space using deformable NeRF, by interpreting image inconsistencies as per-image deformations. Experiments demonstrate the method's improved facial controllability over baselines. Key contributions include the viewpoint-aware image generation approach, solutions for texture sticking and geometric inconsistency, and deformation modeling for 3D avatar reconstruction.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Text2Control3D, a method for controllable text-to-3D avatar generation where the facial expression of the generated avatar can be controlled given a monocular video. The key idea is to first use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to reconstruct the 3D geometry from the input video. Depth maps are rendered from this reconstruction and provided as viewpoint-aware conditions to ControlNet, a text-to-image diffusion model, to generate controllable viewpoint-aware images of the avatar. Two main issues are addressed to enable high-quality avatar generation: 1) Cross-reference attention is proposed to allow constant facial expression and appearance across the generated images by attending to a shared reference. 2) Texture sticking is ameliorated by low-pass filtering the Gaussian latent vector. The viewpoint-aware images are then used to optimize a canonical NeRF model and per-image deformation fields to construct the final controllable 3D avatar. Experiments demonstrate the approach generates higher quality and more controllable avatars compared to baselines.In summary, this paper tackles the novel task of controllable text-to-3D avatar generation using a pipeline that leverages ControlNet to generate viewpoint-aware images with cross-reference attention and latent filtering. The images are then used to optimize a deformable NeRF representation of the 3D avatar. The proposed Text2Control3D approach outperforms baselines in generating high-fidelity, controllable avatars conditioned on text descriptions and input video.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes Text2Control3D, a novel method for controllable text-to-3D avatar generation. The key idea is to first generate a set of viewpoint-aware avatar images using an enhanced version of ControlNet conditioned on extracted depth maps from a monocular video. To enable consistent facial expression and appearance across the viewpoint-aware images, cross-reference attention is proposed where the image generation attends to a shared reference image. To address texture sticking issues, the Gaussian latent is low-pass filtered in the Fourier domain. The generated images, which have some geometric inconsistencies, are then used to reconstruct a 3D avatar in a canonical space using a deformable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) formulation with per-image deformation modeling. This allows generating a high-fidelity 3D avatar that reflects the text condition as well as the facial expression and coarse shape from the monocular video.
