# [Greedy Shapley Client Selection for Communication-Efficient Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09108)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new biased client selection algorithm for federated learning called GreedyFed that aims to improve communication efficiency and enable faster convergence, especially in heterogeneous environments with strict timing constraints. GreedyFed uses a greedy selection strategy to pick the most valuable clients based on their cumulative Shapley Value, which quantifies average marginal contribution to model improvement. It incorporates a fast Monte Carlo approximation method to make Shapley Value computation tractable for applications with many clients. Experiments demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art selection algorithms on real-world image datasets, GreedyFed shows faster and more stable convergence within a fixed communication budget, even with high heterogeneity in data distribution, systems constraints like stragglers, and differential privacy requirements. Key benefits are fewer communication rounds to convergence, higher accuracy under timing constraints, and robustness to practical challenges of non-IID data, systems heterogeneity and privacy needs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of communication-efficient and fast federated learning under practical constraints like heterogeneous data distribution across clients, limited communication opportunities, and differences in client resources and privacy requirements. Standard federated learning algorithms like FedAvg involve uniform random client selection and averaging of updates. This leads to slow convergence when there is high heterogeneity. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel client selection strategy called GreedyFed that greedily selects the most valuable clients based on their average marginal contribution, measured using the Shapley Value (SV). GreedyFed initializes SV using round-robin sampling and then selects top-M SV clients in each round. It uses a fast SV approximation algorithm GTG-Shapley to make the computation tractable.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a purely greedy Shapley value based client selection that experimentally outperforms existing approaches with exploration like UCB and S-FedAvg
- Integrates a fast SV approximation algorithm to make it scalable to many clients
- Evaluates under heterogeneous data, systems constraints, privacy requirements and timing constraints
- Shows faster convergence than FedAvg, FedProx, Power-of-Choice, S-FedAvg and UCB under these constraints
- Very robust to high degree of heterogeneity and noise with low variance
- Achieves accuracy close to centralized training under constraints

In summary, the paper develops a novel greedy Shapley value based client selection strategy for communication-efficient federated learning that is robust, fast converging and accurate under practical heterogeneous environments and timing constraints. The integration of a fast SV estimation algorithm also makes it tractable for real-world deployment.
