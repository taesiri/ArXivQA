# [Greedy Shapley Client Selection for Communication-Efficient Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09108)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new biased client selection algorithm for federated learning called GreedyFed that aims to improve communication efficiency and enable faster convergence, especially in heterogeneous environments with strict timing constraints. GreedyFed uses a greedy selection strategy to pick the most valuable clients based on their cumulative Shapley Value, which quantifies average marginal contribution to model improvement. It incorporates a fast Monte Carlo approximation method to make Shapley Value computation tractable for applications with many clients. Experiments demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art selection algorithms on real-world image datasets, GreedyFed shows faster and more stable convergence within a fixed communication budget, even with high heterogeneity in data distribution, systems constraints like stragglers, and differential privacy requirements. Key benefits are fewer communication rounds to convergence, higher accuracy under timing constraints, and robustness to practical challenges of non-IID data, systems heterogeneity and privacy needs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of communication-efficient and fast federated learning under practical constraints like heterogeneous data distribution across clients, limited communication opportunities, and differences in client resources and privacy requirements. Standard federated learning algorithms like FedAvg involve uniform random client selection and averaging of updates. This leads to slow convergence when there is high heterogeneity. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel client selection strategy called GreedyFed that greedily selects the most valuable clients based on their average marginal contribution, measured using the Shapley Value (SV). GreedyFed initializes SV using round-robin sampling and then selects top-M SV clients in each round. It uses a fast SV approximation algorithm GTG-Shapley to make the computation tractable.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a purely greedy Shapley value based client selection that experimentally outperforms existing approaches with exploration like UCB and S-FedAvg
- Integrates a fast SV approximation algorithm to make it scalable to many clients
- Evaluates under heterogeneous data, systems constraints, privacy requirements and timing constraints
- Shows faster convergence than FedAvg, FedProx, Power-of-Choice, S-FedAvg and UCB under these constraints
- Very robust to high degree of heterogeneity and noise with low variance
- Achieves accuracy close to centralized training under constraints

In summary, the paper develops a novel greedy Shapley value based client selection strategy for communication-efficient federated learning that is robust, fast converging and accurate under practical heterogeneous environments and timing constraints. The integration of a fast SV estimation algorithm also makes it tractable for real-world deployment.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a greedy Shapley value-based client selection strategy called GreedyFed. How is the greediness in client selection motivated as compared to prior works involving exploration like UCB or softmax sampling of clients based on Shapley values?

2. Shapley value relies on the choice of a utility function that associates a value with every subset of clients. What utility function has been used in GreedyFed and why is it an appropriate choice for federated learning?

3. Computing exact Shapley values has combinatorial complexity. What approximation algorithm has been integrated with GreedyFed to make Shapley value computation tractable for applications with many clients?

4. How does GreedyFed handle the exploration vs exploitation tradeoff in client selection, especially since Shapley values for a client decrease as it gets selected more often?

5. What modifications does GreedyFed make over prior works using Shapley values for client selection like UCB and S-FedAvg? What practical challenges do these modifications address?

6. What evaluation metrics and datasets are used to analyze the performance of GreedyFed? How does it perform compared to other baselines under varying data, systems, privacy heterogeneity and timing constraints?

7. What trends do you observe in the performance of GreedyFed and other methods as the degree of data heterogeneity is increased? How does performance vary with different levels of systems heterogeneity and stragglers?

8. Why is GreedyFed particularly suitable for federated learning under strict timing constraints for model convergence? How much gain in accuracy is achieved over baselines with fewer communication rounds?

9. What practical deployment challenges for federated learning are addressed by GreedyFed's faster convergence? What directions are identified for future work extending GreedyFed?

10. How suitable will GreedyFed be in the case of distribution shift between client data and the validation set available at the server? What mitigation strategies can be explored?
