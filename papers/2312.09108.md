# [Greedy Shapley Client Selection for Communication-Efficient Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09108)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new biased client selection algorithm for federated learning called GreedyFed that aims to improve communication efficiency and enable faster convergence, especially in heterogeneous environments with strict timing constraints. GreedyFed uses a greedy selection strategy to pick the most valuable clients based on their cumulative Shapley Value, which quantifies average marginal contribution to model improvement. It incorporates a fast Monte Carlo approximation method to make Shapley Value computation tractable for applications with many clients. Experiments demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art selection algorithms on real-world image datasets, GreedyFed shows faster and more stable convergence within a fixed communication budget, even with high heterogeneity in data distribution, systems constraints like stragglers, and differential privacy requirements. Key benefits are fewer communication rounds to convergence, higher accuracy under timing constraints, and robustness to practical challenges of non-IID data, systems heterogeneity and privacy needs.
