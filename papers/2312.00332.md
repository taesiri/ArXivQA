# [Matching Weak Informative Ontologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00332)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a method for matching ontologies that lack sufficient literal information, referred to as weak informative ontologies (WIOs). The key techniques used are semantic subgraphs, which precisely describe ontology elements using a limited number of highly relevant triples, and a similarity propagation model tailored for ontology matching. Semantic subgraphs are extracted using a circuit model that ranks triples by their capability of conveying information about the element. These subgraphs are used to construct semantic description documents, which a string-matching algorithm uses to generate initial alignment seeds. The similarity propagation model employs a strong constraint condition to restrict meaningless propagations and improve result quality. Useful propagation strategies are also adopted, with a hybrid strategy utilizing cross-validation producing the best results. Experiments on OAEI benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness, significantly outperforming most state-of-the-art approaches on both WIO and general ontology matching tasks. A key advantage is the ability to greatly improve recall while retaining high precision. Limitations are the computational complexity of extracting subgraphs and the number of configurable parameters. Future work will focus on optimization techniques and automatically tuning parameters.
