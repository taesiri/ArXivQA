# [New Foggy Object Detecting Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15455)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Object detection in foggy/poor visibility conditions is challenging for self-driving vehicles. Existing object detection methods like R-CNN and its variants are not accurate enough when coupled with domain adaptation techniques for detecting objects under foggy conditions. They fail to generate tight bounding boxes or properly classify objects.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a new two-stage foggy object detection architecture consisting of Faster R-CNN (FerRCNN) and domain adaptation (DA). 

- The FerRCNN stage focuses on detection by identifying regions of interest (ROIs) and classifying them. This discards unwanted regions, saving time without losing accuracy.

- The DA stage adapts the model to foggy image features using labeled clear images and unlabeled foggy images. Techniques like depth estimation preserve features lost due to fog while reconstruction decoder and pseudo-label generator reduce false detections.

- The architecture is trained on foggy datasets to learn fog-specific features. A loss regularization term is added to reduce loss.

Main Contributions:

- Two-stage detection architecture specifically for foggy conditions combining FerRCNN and DA
- Improved accuracy in detecting and classifying objects in foggy images
- Faster detection time compared to existing methods
- Testing on benchmark dataset shows 85.2% accuracy, substantially improving over previous best of 82.1%.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel two-stage foggy object detection architecture to accurately detect objects under foggy conditions for self-driving vehicle applications. The method achieves higher accuracy and lower detection times than previous techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new two-stage foggy object detection method using faster R-CNN and domain adaptation techniques to improve accuracy in detecting objects under reduced visibility conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new foggy object detection method with a two-stage architecture that combines Faster R-CNN (FerRCNN) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques. Specifically:

- The proposed method incorporates a two-stage architecture consisting of a FerRCNN technique to focus on detection, and a DA technique to treat domain-specific regions of interest (ROIs) critically, discarding unwanted regions to save time without compromising accuracy.

- The method is trained on specific foggy image datasets to enable determining features posed by foggy environments. 

- Techniques like a domain discriminator and depth estimation block are used to extract fog-invariant features and preserve depth distributions respectively.

- A reconstruction decoder reduces counterfeit object characteristics from DA, while a pseudo-label generator includes target domain information and applies consistency regularization.

- Experiments show the proposed method achieves notably higher accuracy (85.2%) in detecting objects in foggy conditions compared to previous Faster R-CNN-based techniques.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a new two-stage foggy object detection architecture that combines FerRCNN and DA to achieve improved accuracy over prior art.
