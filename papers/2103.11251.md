## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of this paper suggest several future research directions, including:- Improving the scalability of optimal sparse decision trees and decision lists/sets. They suggest developing algorithms that reduce dimensionality and leverage computational reuse to handle larger datasets more efficiently.- Efficiently handling continuous variables in decision trees and scoring systems. Current methods often require pre-processing continuous variables into many binary dummy variables, which hurts scalability. New techniques are needed to jointly optimize over choice of variables, thresholds, and model structure.- Adding more graceful handling of constraints into sparse logical models and scoring systems. This includes global constraints like monotonicity.- Improving training, uncertainty quantification, and experimental design for physics-informed neural networks. This includes mitigating issues like gradient pathologies during training.- Better characterizing and approximating the "Rashomon set" of good models for a task. This includes developing metrics to measure the size of the Rashomon set, visualization techniques, and ways to efficiently search within it.- Developing more accurate yet interpretable reinforcement learning policies and value functions, such as by adding sparsity constraints or structure. This includes determining when interpretable policies exist.- For neural network disentanglement, challenges include disentangling entire layers, introducing better ways to incorporate hierarchy and relationships between concepts, quantitatively evaluating unsupervised disentanglement, and making the mapping from disentangled representations to outputs more interpretable.- For case-based reasoning, extending to more complex data like video, integrating human domain knowledge into prototype learning, and troubleshooting/replacing bad prototypes.- For dimension reduction, more accurately capturing information from high-dimensional space, automatic hyperparameter tuning, and interpreting the dimension reduction mapping itself.So in summary, many open challenges remain in scaling up interpretable methods, introducing better constraints, performing concept learning, interfacing models with human expertise, disentangling representations, characterizing model multiplicity, and more. The authors lay out an extensive research agenda for the interpretable ML community.
