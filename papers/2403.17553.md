# [RuBia: A Russian Language Bias Detection Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17553)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to learn and reproduce the social and cultural biases present in their training data. 
- Most existing bias evaluation datasets for LLMs are in English, leaving a gap for other languages like Russian.
- There is a need for a Russian language dataset to evaluate biases in LLMs, especially related to gender, nationality, socio-economics, and diverse identities. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces RuBia, a new Russian language bias detection dataset with 1989 unique sentence pairs across 4 domains and 19 subdomains. 
- The data was collected via crowdsourcing using a Telegram bot and then validated by native speakers. 
- Sentence pairs consist of a "pro-trope" sentence expressing a stereotype and an "anti-trope" sentence contradicting it.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of RuBia, the first Russian language dataset for evaluating biases in LLMs. Covers biases related to gender, nationality, socio-economics and diverse identities.
- Analysis of 9 Russian language LLMs using perplexity scores on RuBia reveals all models exhibit bias to varying degrees. 
- Multilingual models were less gender-biased compared to monolingual Russian models.
- Larger Russian LLMs tended to be more biased than smaller ones.
- Evaluation of ChatGPT on RuBia shows distinct biased behavior compared to other LLMs.

The paper introduces a new diagnostic tool for the Russian language to evaluate biases in LLMs. Key contributions are the RuBia dataset itself and analysis of multiple Russian LLMs using this dataset.
