# [Fast-Poly: A Fast Polyhedral Framework For 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current 3D multi-object trackers face challenges with consistency in accuracy and latency when tested on large-scale autonomous driving datasets like nuScenes and Waymo. The key issues are:

1) Rotated 3D objects lead to slow geometry calculations for spatial metrics like IoU. 

2) Global perspective of tracking pipeline causes redundant computations between distant unrelated objects. 

3) Heavy matrix operations in Kalman Filter burden real-time performance.

4) Inherent serial logic in Tracking-by-Detection (TBD) framework limits parallelization.

Proposed Solution - Fast-Poly:

1) Aligns rotated objects to axis-aligned boxes and uses 2D IoU for fast similarity calculation. This proposed A-IoU reduces latency while maintaining accuracy.

2) Introduces voxel mask based on spatial proximity to avoid redundant cost computations between distant objects. Also uses lightweight filter to decouple static states from Kalman Filter to reduce matrix burden.  

3) Employs confidence-count mixed strategy to flexibly terminate trajectories, enhancing robustness.

4) Leverages parallel processing for prediction and preprocessing modules to mitigate serial limitation of TBD pipeline.

Main Contributions:

- Establishes new state-of-the-art on nuScenes test bench with 75.8% AMOTA at 34.2 FPS using only CPU. Surpasses previous best method by 5x inference speed.

- Achieves competitive 63.6% MOTA at 35.5 FPS on Waymo test bench.

- Proposes techniques like A-IoU, voxel mask, lightweight filter and trajectory termination to advance accuracy and latency trade-off for 3D trackers.

- Parallelization of TBD modules enhances real-time efficiency without accuracy loss.

- Serves as a strong baseline by open sourcing the code to benefit research community.

In summary, Fast-Poly pushes filter-based 3D trackers to new levels of accuracy and speed by innovating on multiple fronts like alignment, densification and parallelization. The techniques can enable deployment of such trackers in real-world autonomous driving systems.
