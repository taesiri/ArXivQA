# [Towards Online Real-Time Memory-based Video Inpainting Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16161)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current state-of-the-art video inpainting models achieve high quality results but have two main limitations: 1) They process the entire video offline in batch mode rather than frame-by-frame online. 2) Their computational complexity is too high for real-time processing at sufficient frame rates (e.g 20 FPS). These limitations prevent their use for live video inpainting. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a framework to adapt existing transformer-based video inpainting models to:
1) Online setting: Process frames causally as they come, using only past context. 
2) Real-time speed: Achieve 20+ FPS by optimizing attention computation.  

The key ideas are:
- Establish an online baseline by modifying models to use only past frames. Quality drops but frame rate is still low.  
- Add a memory to cache past computations. This reduces redundant calculations and significantly increases FPS but further reduces quality.
- Refine the memory-based approach by having a second network gradually improve the cached results. This gives both high FPS and improved quality.

Contributions:
- An online baseline for comparing video inpainting models
- A memory-based optimization to achieve real-time speeds
- A two-network refined architecture with both speed and quality

Experiments show the refined model achieves 20+ FPS online inpainting on multiple datasets while minimizing the drop in visual quality compared to offline models. The framework is demonstrated on several recent transformer architectures.

To summarize, the paper enables state-of-the-art video inpainting for live videos by proposing optimizations for online and real-time processing while preserving visual quality.
