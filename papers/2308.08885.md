# [Event-Guided Procedure Planning from Instructional Videos with Text   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08885)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to bridge the semantic gap between observed visual states (start and goal states) and unobserved intermediate actions in procedure planning from instructional videos, in order to predict more accurate procedures?The key hypothesis is that leveraging event information can help bridge this semantic gap and lead to better procedure planning performance. Specifically:1) Planning a procedure from an instructional video is to complete a specific event, and a specific event usually involves specific actions. Therefore, event information can be used to guide the procedure planning process.2) There are usually strong associations between actions within an event. Modeling these action relations can help predict a more reasonable procedure.To test these hypotheses, the paper proposes a novel event-guided paradigm and an Event-guided Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on multiple datasets, where E3P achieves new state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the paper aims to address the problem of the semantic gap in procedure planning from instructional videos by utilizing event information, through both guiding the planning process and modeling action relations. The central hypothesis is that an event-guided approach can substantially improve procedure planning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel event-guided paradigm for procedure planning from instructional videos with text supervision. This paradigm aims to bridge the semantic gap between observed visual states and unobserved intermediate actions by first inferring the events from the visual states and then planning actions based on the states and predicted events. 2. Based on the proposed paradigm, the paper contributes an Event-guided Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) model. The key components of this model are:- An Event-aware Prompt Generator that encodes event information into the prompts to guide the planning process. - An Action Relation Mining module that models the associations between actions within each event using a mask-and-predict approach.3. The paper demonstrates through experiments on three datasets that the proposed E3P model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. This verifies the effectiveness of the event-guided paradigm and the E3P model.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel event-guided paradigm to bridge the semantic gap in procedure planning from instructional videos, and an E3P model that operationalizes this paradigm and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The key novelty is exploiting event information to guide the planning process.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an event-guided procedure planning method called E3P that encodes event information into handcrafted prompts and models action relations using a mask-and-predict approach to bridge the semantic gap between observed states and unobserved actions for predicting action sequences from instructional videos.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on procedure planning from instructional videos:- This paper introduces a new event-guided paradigm for bridging the semantic gap between observed visual states and unobserved intermediate actions. Previous works have not explored leveraging event information in this way for procedure planning. The proposed paradigm of inferring events first and then planning actions based on the events is novel.- The paper contributes a new model called Event-guided Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) based on the event-guided paradigm. It uses an Event-aware Prompt Generator to incorporate event information into the prompts, and an Action Relation Mining module to model associations between actions. These components are unique compared to prior models.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets - CrossTask, COIN, and NIV. The consistent improvements over prior methods like P3IV, DDN, and others highlight the benefits of the proposed techniques.- The event-guided paradigm is shown to be useful even without access to a pre-trained text encoder like CLIP, suggesting it is a generalizable idea. The ablation studies thoroughly analyze the impact of each component.- Most prior works have focused on using intermediate visual states or adversarial training strategies. This work shows the value of leveraging event information and action relations, an underexplored area, to improve procedure planning.In summary, the key novelties are the event-guided paradigm, the E3P model design, and the effectiveness demonstrated through extensive experiments and ablation studies. The paper makes important contributions to advancing research on procedure planning from instructional videos.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Extending the event-guided procedure planning approach to settings where the test events are not seen during training. The authors note that their method and previous works perform poorly when evaluated on novel unseen events. Developing methods that can generalize to new events is an important direction.- Exploring more sophisticated methods for encoding event information to guide the procedure planning, beyond the event classifier and aggregator used in this work. The event information provides useful guidance, but there is room to explore better ways to leverage it. - Developing reinforcement learning or other interactive learning based approaches for procedure planning that can learn from experience in an environment, rather than relying solely on static instructional videos during training. - Scaling up the approach to handle much longer instructional videos and procedures, since the current benchmarks focus on relatively short videos and procedures. Developing methods that can effectively plan multi-step procedures from longer videos is an important direction.- Incorporating additional context and background knowledge beyond the instructional video frames, such as object attributes or physics knowledge, to improve planning. The current methods rely solely on visual information. - Extending the procedure planning capability to interactive settings where an agent can take actions and receive feedback, rather than passively predicting a procedure from a video. This could enable more flexible planning.In summary, some of the key future directions are 1) generalizing to new events, 2) leveraging additional context/knowledge, 3) scaling up to longer videos/procedures, 4) interactive planning agents, and 5) exploring more advanced methods for encoding event information. Advancing research in these areas could significantly extend the capabilities of video-based procedure planning.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel event-guided paradigm for procedure planning from instructional videos with text supervision. The key idea is to leverage event information to bridge the semantic gap between observed start/goal visual states and unobserved intermediate actions. The paper introduces an Event-guided Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) model with two main components: 1) An Event-aware Prompt Generator extracts event information from the start/goal states and encodes it into hand-crafted text prompts to generate event-aware prompts that guide the procedure planning process. 2) An Action Relation Mining module adopts a mask-and-predict approach to model associations between actions within each event, helping produce more reasonable procedures. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-guided paradigm. E3P with event-aware prompts significantly outperforms baselines without event information. The action relation mining also improves results by capturing dependencies between actions. Overall, E3P achieves new state-of-the-art on the procedure planning task, outperforming previous methods by a large margin. The consistent improvements validate the benefits of leveraging event information and modeling action relations under the novel event-guided paradigm for bridging the semantic gap in procedure planning.
