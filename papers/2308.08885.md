# [Event-Guided Procedure Planning from Instructional Videos with Text   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08885)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to bridge the semantic gap between observed visual states (start and goal states) and unobserved intermediate actions in procedure planning from instructional videos, in order to predict more accurate procedures?The key hypothesis is that leveraging event information can help bridge this semantic gap and lead to better procedure planning performance. Specifically:1) Planning a procedure from an instructional video is to complete a specific event, and a specific event usually involves specific actions. Therefore, event information can be used to guide the procedure planning process.2) There are usually strong associations between actions within an event. Modeling these action relations can help predict a more reasonable procedure.To test these hypotheses, the paper proposes a novel event-guided paradigm and an Event-guided Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on multiple datasets, where E3P achieves new state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the paper aims to address the problem of the semantic gap in procedure planning from instructional videos by utilizing event information, through both guiding the planning process and modeling action relations. The central hypothesis is that an event-guided approach can substantially improve procedure planning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel event-guided paradigm for procedure planning from instructional videos with text supervision. This paradigm aims to bridge the semantic gap between observed visual states and unobserved intermediate actions by first inferring the events from the visual states and then planning actions based on the states and predicted events. 2. Based on the proposed paradigm, the paper contributes an Event-guided Prompting-based Procedure Planning (E3P) model. The key components of this model are:- An Event-aware Prompt Generator that encodes event information into the prompts to guide the planning process. - An Action Relation Mining module that models the associations between actions within each event using a mask-and-predict approach.3. The paper demonstrates through experiments on three datasets that the proposed E3P model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. This verifies the effectiveness of the event-guided paradigm and the E3P model.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel event-guided paradigm to bridge the semantic gap in procedure planning from instructional videos, and an E3P model that operationalizes this paradigm and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The key novelty is exploiting event information to guide the planning process.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an event-guided procedure planning method called E3P that encodes event information into handcrafted prompts and models action relations using a mask-and-predict approach to bridge the semantic gap between observed states and unobserved actions for predicting action sequences from instructional videos.
