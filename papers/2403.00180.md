# ["Flex Tape Can't Fix That": Bias and Misinformation in Edited Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00180)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Model editing methods like weight editing aim to efficiently update knowledge in language models after deployment, but can have unintended consequences unrelated to the edits. Specifically, they may amplify existing model biases related to race, gender, geography etc.

- Current evaluation methods for model editing like specificity do not adequately capture the impact of edits on model biases or qualitative flaws in generated text. 

Methodology:
- The paper introduces S\textsc{eesaw}-CF, a new benchmark dataset to assess bias-related harms of model editing methods. It contains single-property cases to measure biases and cross-property cases to measure inaccuracies.

- Using S\textsc{eesaw}-CF, the paper studies 3 weight editing methods - constrained fine-tuning, MEMIT, and MEND on the GPT-J model. It evaluates their impact on biases using phrase completions and on qualitative flaws using human evaluation of long-form text generations.

Key Findings:
- Edited GPT-J exhibits lower confidence in facts about Asian, African, South American subjects across editing methods, especially for nationality/language. Fine-tuning performs the worst.

- Long-form generations show increases in sexism, xenophobia, religious injection etc. after editing gender or nationality, with the most significant flaws occurring for MEMIT.

- Editing facts about place of birth, citizenship or gender negatively impacts unrelated properties like occupation, demonstrating unintended bleeding of information.

Main Contributions:  
- First investigation of impact of weight editing methods on model biases using the novel S\textsc{eesaw}-CF benchmark
- Analysis highlighting risks of existing editing methods in amplifying demographic biases and misinformation
- Results motivate developing editing methods that do not alter base models to avoid unintended harms
