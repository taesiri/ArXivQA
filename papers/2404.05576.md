# [Dynamic Backtracking in GFlowNets: Enhancing Decision Steps with   Reward-Dependent Adjustment Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) are powerful generative models for producing useful compositions like chemicals and proteins. However, previous GFNs can struggle to efficiently explore the search space and accumulate experience, often getting stuck in suboptimal solutions or lost in high-dimensional spaces. 

Proposed Solution:
- This paper introduces Dynamic Backtracking GFN (DB-GFN), which enhances the adaptability of GFNs by allowing backtracking during the construction process based on the reward values. 

- The key ideas are:
   1) Nodes backtrack a dynamic number of steps based on their reward value, with lower rewards leading to more backtracking 
   2) After backtracking, nodes undergo forward propagation again to find better paths
   3) Comparisons are made between new and original paths, keeping whichever has the higher reward or better fits the reward distribution

Main Contributions:
- DB-GFN consistently achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy than prior GFNs and reinforcement learning methods on tasks like molecular graph generation and RNA sequence design.

- It discovers many more high-scoring modes than other methods, with experiments showing over 2X more discoveries on some tasks.

- DB-GFN also shows much better fitting to the true reward distribution compared to a recent method LS-GFN, with around 4X higher correlation.

- It demonstrates good versatility, improving performance when combined with various existing GFN model foundations.

- As an orthogonal approach, DB-GFN is a powerful tool to integrate with other GFN improvements for even more efficient search.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to leverage backtracking and reward comparisons to enhance GFN adaptability and avoid poor local optima. Experiments verify superior performance on several generative biology tasks.
