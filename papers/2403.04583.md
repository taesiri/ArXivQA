# [Unbiased Estimator for Distorted Conics in Camera Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using circular patterns for camera calibration can achieve higher accuracy than checkerboard patterns. However, lens distortion destroys the conic geometry, making it difficult to accurately locate the centroid of the projected circles. This limits the utility of circular patterns. 

- Existing approaches either ignore distortion or use spherical targets to avoid this issue. But ignoring distortion introduces bias. Spherical targets are cumbersome.

- There is a need for an unbiased estimator to enable using planar circular targets while properly handling distortion.

Solution: 
- The paper presents a novel analytic unbiased estimator using moment theory to track the centroid of the distorted ellipses. 

- It leverages the key mathematical insight that the first moment (centroid) can be estimated without bias even after distortion.

- The centroid of the distorted ellipse is expressed as a linear combination of nth moments of the undistorted ellipse.

- This allows accurately tracking moments through perspective projection and polynomial distortion transformations.

Contributions:

- First closed-form unbiased estimator for distorted conics, completing the missing piece for circular pattern calibration.

- Pioneers use of moment theory in calibration. Provides thorough derivation and proofs.

- Enables planar circular targets to achieve better accuracy than checkerboards under distortion.

- Applicable beyond calibration where conic features undergo nonlinear transformations.

- Validated experimentally to show substantially improved calibration, especially for challenging thermal IR images.

In summary, the paper delivers an elegant theoretical contribution that helps overcome a key limitation in circular pattern calibration. This unlocks the benefits of circular targets and advances calibration capabilities.
