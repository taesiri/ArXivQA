# [Improve Robustness of Reinforcement Learning against Observation   Perturbations via $l_\infty$ Lipschitz Policy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08751)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel robust reinforcement learning method called SortRL to improve the robustness of policies against observation perturbations. SortRL employs a new policy network architecture based on an Lipschitz neural network called SortNet, which provides global Lipschitz continuity to bound the change in outputs given perturbed inputs. A convenient robustness evaluation method is introduced based on the output margin between top action scores. Moreover, a training framework is designed involving policy distillation on clean observation-action pairs from an expert teacher policy, while optimizing for task performance and robustness simultaneously via a cross entropy loss and a hinge-based robustness loss. Experiments on control tasks and Atari/ProcGen games demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness of SortRL against different perturbation strengths. The performance decays much more slowly compared to prior methods as perturbation strength increases. Even on nominal environments without perturbations, SortRL achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. The results showcase the effectiveness of architectural choices and training methodology of SortRL for improving policy robustness.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies are susceptible to slight perturbations or noise in observations, leading to irrational decisions. This vulnerability limits the reliability and applicability of DRL agents in real-world scenarios. Existing methods address this issue using policy regularization or adversarial training, but have limitations like high compute costs or performance sacrifices.

Proposed Solution - SortRL:  
This paper proposes a novel robust DRL method called SortRL to enhance policy robustness against observation perturbations from a network architecture perspective. The key ideas are:

1) Employ a novel policy network architecture called SortNet that provides global L-infinity Lipschitz continuity to ensure smoothness and stability against perturbations.

2) Introduce a robustness measure called "robust radius" to quantify policy robustness. Maximize this radius during training to improve robustness. 

3) Design a training framework based on policy distillation that trains the agent to solve tasks successfully while maximizing the robust radius against worst-case perturbations.

Main Contributions:

1) First study to address policy vulnerability in DRL from a network architecture angle using Lipschitz properties.

2) Introduce SortNet policy networks that provide efficiency, expressiveness and convenient robustness evaluation via output margins.

3) Propose an effective training framework to obtain optimal policies with customizable robustness against observation attacks.

4) Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and robustness on control and video game tasks, especially on strong adversaries compared to existing methods.

The core idea is to leverage architectural Lipschitz properties rather than regularizers for stability. The proposed method achieves optimality, efficiency and strong robustness simultaneously for reliable DRL.
