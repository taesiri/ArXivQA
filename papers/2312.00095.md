## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate short-term power demand forecasting is crucial for planning and operating power grids, but is challenging due to increasing complexity from extreme weather, new technologies like storage and demand-side management, and emerging business models. Lack of theoretical guidance and public feature databases limits the features used, restricting forecast accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a textual-knowledge-guided numerical feature discovery (TKNFD) method for power demand forecasting. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a power demand feature corpus by crawling official websites for qualitative textual knowledge on factors influencing agricultural, industrial, commercial and residential power use.

2) Mine this corpus using a proposed dual-correlated words algorithm to discover features across integrated energy, astronomy and geography dimensions. 

3) Expand these dimensions and construct a 4D multivariate source-tracking database (4DM-STD) with historical load data and numerical data for candidate features.

4) Identify dominant features independently of forecasting models using variance thresholding and Select-K-Best.

5) Analyze contribution and dependence correlation of features.

Main Contributions:

- Discovers 43-48 dominant features spanning integrated energy, astronomy, geography and social dimensions, outperforming state-of-the-art by 16.84-36.36% MAPE.

- Reveals several dominant and previously unknown features especially in integrated energy and astronomy.

- Identifies that integrated energy has most significant impact, astronomy and geography moderate impact and social has least.

- Systematically analyzes feature contribution and dependency correlation with power demand.

- Provides publicly available 4DM-STD baseline feature databases to enable further research.

The method is model-independent and applicable to other forecasting tasks lacking theoretical guidance or public databases.
