## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate short-term power demand forecasting is crucial for planning and operating power grids, but is challenging due to increasing complexity from extreme weather, new technologies like storage and demand-side management, and emerging business models. Lack of theoretical guidance and public feature databases limits the features used, restricting forecast accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a textual-knowledge-guided numerical feature discovery (TKNFD) method for power demand forecasting. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a power demand feature corpus by crawling official websites for qualitative textual knowledge on factors influencing agricultural, industrial, commercial and residential power use.

2) Mine this corpus using a proposed dual-correlated words algorithm to discover features across integrated energy, astronomy and geography dimensions. 

3) Expand these dimensions and construct a 4D multivariate source-tracking database (4DM-STD) with historical load data and numerical data for candidate features.

4) Identify dominant features independently of forecasting models using variance thresholding and Select-K-Best.

5) Analyze contribution and dependence correlation of features.

Main Contributions:

- Discovers 43-48 dominant features spanning integrated energy, astronomy, geography and social dimensions, outperforming state-of-the-art by 16.84-36.36% MAPE.

- Reveals several dominant and previously unknown features especially in integrated energy and astronomy.

- Identifies that integrated energy has most significant impact, astronomy and geography moderate impact and social has least.

- Systematically analyzes feature contribution and dependency correlation with power demand.

- Provides publicly available 4DM-STD baseline feature databases to enable further research.

The method is model-independent and applicable to other forecasting tasks lacking theoretical guidance or public databases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a textual-knowledge-guided numerical feature discovery method that interacts text and numerical data modalities to systematically discover new dominant features from integrated energy and astronomical dimensions, improving short-term power demand forecasting accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new method called textual-knowledge-guided numerical feature discovery (TKNFD) for power demand forecasting. This method uses text mining to gather qualitative knowledge about factors affecting power demand, and uses this knowledge to guide the discovery of quantitative features from numerical data. 

2. It builds four-dimensional multivariate source-tracking databases (4DM-STDs) covering geography, astronomy, integrated energy, and social dimensions. These databases serve as public baseline feature databases for short-term power demand forecasting.

3. It identifies 43-48 dominant features affecting power demand through a two-level quantitative identification strategy independent of forecasting models. Many of these features are previously unknown, especially in the integrated energy and astronomy dimensions.

4. Through benchmark experiments and analysis, it shows that the features discovered by TKNFD reliably improve forecast accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reveal new insights about factors affecting power demand, and quantify the contribution and correlations of different features.

In summary, the key innovation is using a text-guided multimodal approach to systematically discover new and better features for forecasting power demand. The discovered features, databases, analyses, and insights are valuable contributions.
