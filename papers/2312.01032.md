# [Harnessing the Power of Prompt-based Techniques for Generating   School-Level Questions using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing high-quality educational questions is challenging and time-consuming for teachers. 
- Existing QA datasets focus on factoid questions and are not suitable for generating descriptive, reasoning-based questions needed in schools.

Proposed Solution: 
- Authors create a new dataset called EduProbe using NCERT textbook content. It has 3,502 samples with context, long prompt, short prompt and question quadruplets.
- Questions involve deeper reasoning (46% are procedural, cause or consequence questions).
- Explore prompt-based question generation using large language models like PEGASUS, T5, MBART, BART, Text-Davinci and GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- Compare question quality using automated metrics like ROUGE, METEOR etc. and human evaluation on criteria like grammaticality, relevance, complexity etc.

Key Contributions:
- EduProbe dataset for school-level question generation requiring reasoning
- Study of different prompt-based techniques like long prompt, short prompt and without prompt for question generation
- Models can generate diverse questions from the same context using prompts 
- Analysis showing Text-Davinci generates most appropriate, relevant and complex questions in human evaluation, though models still fall short of human performance overall

The paper introduces an important new dataset to promote research into educationally-aligned question generation using recent advances in language models. Through comprehensive analysis, the authors showcase how prompt-based techniques can enable generating a rich variety of descriptive, reasoning-based questions.
