# [Harnessing the Power of Prompt-based Techniques for Generating   School-Level Questions using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing high-quality educational questions is challenging and time-consuming for teachers. 
- Existing QA datasets focus on factoid questions and are not suitable for generating descriptive, reasoning-based questions needed in schools.

Proposed Solution: 
- Authors create a new dataset called EduProbe using NCERT textbook content. It has 3,502 samples with context, long prompt, short prompt and question quadruplets.
- Questions involve deeper reasoning (46% are procedural, cause or consequence questions).
- Explore prompt-based question generation using large language models like PEGASUS, T5, MBART, BART, Text-Davinci and GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- Compare question quality using automated metrics like ROUGE, METEOR etc. and human evaluation on criteria like grammaticality, relevance, complexity etc.

Key Contributions:
- EduProbe dataset for school-level question generation requiring reasoning
- Study of different prompt-based techniques like long prompt, short prompt and without prompt for question generation
- Models can generate diverse questions from the same context using prompts 
- Analysis showing Text-Davinci generates most appropriate, relevant and complex questions in human evaluation, though models still fall short of human performance overall

The paper introduces an important new dataset to promote research into educationally-aligned question generation using recent advances in language models. Through comprehensive analysis, the authors showcase how prompt-based techniques can enable generating a rich variety of descriptive, reasoning-based questions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel prompt-based question generation approach using large language models, curates a new educational question generation dataset EduProbe, and performs an in-depth study of different prompt techniques and models using both automatic and human evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Developing a new dataset called EduProbe, sourced from NCERT textbooks, for generating descriptive and reasoning-based questions related to school-level subjects like History, Geography, Economics, Environmental Studies, and Science.

2) Exploring different types of prompt-based techniques (e.g. long prompt, short prompt, and without prompt) with state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like Text-Davinci-003, GPT-3.5-Turbo, PEGASUS, T5, MBART, and BART to provide additional guidance to the question generation (QG) models.

3) Comprehensive evaluation of the QG models using both automated metrics and human evaluation. The automated metrics show that T5 performs the best but still falls short of human performance. The human evaluation reveals that Text-Davinci-003 generates the most grammatical, appropriate and relevant questions, while also exceeding human performance in terms of question complexity and novelty.

In summary, the key contribution is the new EduProbe dataset and analysis of prompt-based QG techniques using this dataset to generate better educational questions. The results provide insights into the utility of prompts for improving question quality and variation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed prompt-based question generation approach leverage additional context to generate more descriptive and reasoning-based questions compared to prior question generation methods?

2. What were the key differences in model architectures and training techniques utilized between the general-purpose LLMs like Davinci and ChatGPT versus the domain-specific LLMs like T5 and BART that were fine-tuned? 

3. How did the authors devise an appropriate strategy for evaluating both the syntactic quality as well as the semantic relevance of the wide range of questions generated using both automated metrics and human evaluation?

4. What were some of the limitations of existing QA datasets that motivated the authors to create a new dataset more tailored to educational question generation across multiple subjects and grade levels? 

5. In what ways did the authors' analysis reveal differences in the types of questions generated using long prompts, short prompts, and no prompts across both general-purpose and fine-tuned LLMs?

6. Why do the authors argue that current automated metrics have significant limitations in properly evaluating the quality of reasoning-based and descriptive questions generated by the LLMs?

7. What specifically about the architecture and training methodology of models like Davinci and ChatGPT made them adept at generating quite novel questions that differed from the gold standard questions? 

8. How might the authors' approach for prompt-based question generation be extended to additional use cases beyond high school educational contexts such as university-level materials or workplace training content?

9. What are some of the risks associated with deploying AI-generated questions at scale for high-stakes educational assessments and how might the authors' approach help to mitigate these risks?

10. Why do the authors believe that despite the strong results demonstrated, existing LLMs still fall short of human-level performance in most aspects of high-quality question generation and what steps can be taken to close this gap?
