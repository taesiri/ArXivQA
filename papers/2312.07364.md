# [Collapse-Oriented Adversarial Training with Triplet Decoupling for   Robust Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07364)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel defense called COLO-TRIDE against adversarial attacks on image retrieval systems based on deep metric learning (DML) models. It addresses two main limitations in existing defense methods: model collapse and weak adversary. To prevent model collapse, COLO orients the direction of perturbation updates between attacking and assisting the model based on a new metric called "collapseness" that tracks the model's state. To strengthen the adversary, TRIDE decouples the perturbation updates on the anchor, positive, and negative samples in a triplet into two alternating phases - anchor perturbation (ANP) and candidate perturbation (CAP). Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that COLO-TRIDE yields state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 7% on average across multiple robustness metrics. It does so with only half the number of PGD steps, making it 15% faster in training time. The authors also identify issues with commonly used robustness metrics and propose a new metric called Adversarial Resistance Score for more comprehensive evaluation. Overall, this work makes solid contributions in making DML image retrieval systems more robust against adversarial attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel defense against adversarial attacks on image retrieval models called COLO-TRIDE, which prevents model collapse during adversarial training by temporally orienting the perturbation updates and decouples the triplet structure to strengthen the adversary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes COLO-TRIDE, a new defense against adversarial attacks on image retrieval models. COLO-TRIDE has two main components:

- COLO (Collapse-Oriented adversary) which prevents model collapse during adversarial training by orienting the perturbation updates to either assist or attack the model based on the model's state. A new metric called "collapseness" is introduced to track model state.

- TRIDE (Triplet Decoupling) which decouples the perturbation updates on the three components of a triplet into two phases - anchor perturbation (ANP) and candidate perturbation (CAP). This leads to a stronger adversary for adversarial training.

2. It demonstrates that COLO-TRIDE addresses two key limitations of prior defenses - model collapse and weak adversary. Experiments on 3 datasets show it outperforms state-of-the-art with only half the number of PGD steps.

3. It identifies limitations in the commonly used robustness evaluation metric (ERS) and proposes a new more comprehensive metric called Adversarial Resistance Score (ARS) for evaluating model robustness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Adversarial training - The paper proposes a novel adversarial training method called COLO-TRIDE to defend against adversarial attacks on image retrieval systems. 

- Model collapse - One of the key problems addressed in the paper is model collapse, where models embed all samples very close together and cannot distinguish them. The proposed COLO method aims to prevent model collapse.

- Triplet decoupling (TRIDE) - A key contribution of the paper is proposing triplet decoupling to address the problem of weak adversaries in existing defenses. TRIDE decouples perturbation updates on the anchor, positive, and negative into two phases.

- Collapse-oriented (COLO) adversarial training - The paper proposes COLO adversarial training which orients the perturbation update direction based on the collapse state of the model to prevent model collapse.

- Collapseness - A new metric proposed to measure the state of model collapse which guides the COLO method on whether to attack or assist the model.

- Adversarial resistance score (ARS) - The paper identifies limitations of existing robustness metrics like empirical robustness score and proposes a new more comprehensive metric called ARS.

In summary, the key focus areas are adversarial training defenses for image retrieval, preventing model collapse, triplet decoupling, and more meaningful evaluation of robustness.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Collapse-Oriented Adversarial Training with Triplet Decoupling for Robust Image Retrieval":

Problem:
- Image retrieval systems based on deep metric learning (DML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing defense methods suffer from two key limitations: model collapse and weak adversary.

- Model collapse happens when a model incorrectly maps all input samples very close in the embedding space, making it unable to distinguish between them. This is a major obstacle in adversarial training for DML models. Current defenses avoid collapse by restricting perturbation strength, which limits performance.

- Weak adversary refers to the insufficient perturbation generated by current defense methods in DML due to directly adopting strategies from image classification. They distribute small perturbations to all components of a triplet, comprising anchor, positive and negative. This leads to limited robustness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a defense called COLO-TRIDE comprising of two components to address the above limitations:
   1. COLO (Collapse-Oriented Adversary): Temporally orients perturbation to either attack or assist the model based on the collapse state, measured by a new metric called collapseness. This prevents model collapse.
   2. TRIDE (Triplet Decoupling): Decouples perturbation of triplet components into two alternating phases - Candidate Perturbation (CAP) and Anchor Perturbation (ANP). This creates stronger perturbation and robustness.

- CAP shifts embeddings of positive and negative candidates while keeping anchor fixed. ANP directly perturbs anchors and incorporates additional terms to reinforce locality around anchors. Alternating between the two yields maximized embedding shifts for robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes COLO-TRIDE defense to address model collapse and weak adversary limitations in current DML defenses against adversarial attacks.

- Introduces metric called collapseness to proactively measure model collapse state and  guide collapse-oriented adversarial updates.

- Decouples triplet perturbations through TRIDE to create stronger adversarial training.

- Shows state-of-the-art performance across 3 datasets, evaluated on 10 robustness metrics. 

- Identifies limitations in current evaluation metrics and proposes a more comprehensive and fair metric called Adversarial Resistance Score (ARS).
