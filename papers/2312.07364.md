# [Collapse-Oriented Adversarial Training with Triplet Decoupling for   Robust Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07364)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel defense called COLO-TRIDE against adversarial attacks on image retrieval systems based on deep metric learning (DML) models. It addresses two main limitations in existing defense methods: model collapse and weak adversary. To prevent model collapse, COLO orients the direction of perturbation updates between attacking and assisting the model based on a new metric called "collapseness" that tracks the model's state. To strengthen the adversary, TRIDE decouples the perturbation updates on the anchor, positive, and negative samples in a triplet into two alternating phases - anchor perturbation (ANP) and candidate perturbation (CAP). Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that COLO-TRIDE yields state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 7% on average across multiple robustness metrics. It does so with only half the number of PGD steps, making it 15% faster in training time. The authors also identify issues with commonly used robustness metrics and propose a new metric called Adversarial Resistance Score for more comprehensive evaluation. Overall, this work makes solid contributions in making DML image retrieval systems more robust against adversarial attacks.
