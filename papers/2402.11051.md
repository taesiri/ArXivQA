# [Large Language Models Fall Short: Understanding Complex Relationships in   Detective Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11051)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing datasets for evaluating narrative understanding often use simplistic texts and relationships between characters. They fail to capture the complexity and uncertainty of relationships in real-life social scenarios.  
- Detective stories feature intricate character relationships involving secrets, multiple identities, hidden perspectives, etc. making them ideal for assessing language models' ability to comprehend nuanced relationships.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce Conan, a new benchmark dataset designed specifically for extracting and analyzing complex character relation graphs from detective narratives.

Key Features of Conan Dataset:
- Features hierarchical relationship categories built using insights from social science. Includes public, secret and inferred relationships from the viewpoints of different characters.

- Annotated by experts to extract characters and label nuanced relationships between them across 24 long detective stories.

- Analyzed performance of large language models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama2 on Conan using 3 strategies - jointly extract all relations, direct relation extraction and relation extraction between character pairs.

Key Findings:
- State-of-the-art LLMs struggle on Conan due to the complexity of relationship information and long input lengths.

- GPT-4 performs best but still substantially underperforms humans.

- Detailed analysis reveals strengths and weaknesses of different baseline strategies.

Main Contributions:
- Constructed the first benchmark Conan for assessing LLMs' ability to comprehend complex relationships in long detective narratives.

- Designed a hierarchical relationship scheme rooted in social science to enable nuanced relationship annotation and evaluation.  

- Carried out comprehensive experiments using GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama2 to demonstrate limitations of current LLMs.

- Findings provide directions for improving LLMs' inferential capabilities and key information extraction from long texts.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem being addressed, the proposed Conan dataset and annotation scheme, experiments conducted using state-of-the-art LLMs, major results and limitations identified, and contributions made by the paper.
