# [Two-Person Interaction Augmentation with Skeleton Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05490)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Capturing high-quality skeletal motion data of two characters having close and continuous interactions (e.g. hugging, dancing) is challenging and expensive. 
- Existing skeletal datasets lack diversity in interaction types and body size variations.
- Existing methods for motion retargeting are either optimization-based which are slow or data-driven which require large amounts of training data.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new conditional deep generative model to generate skeletal motion variations of two interacting characters with different body sizes/proportions.
- Model jointly predicts motions of both characters while retaining interaction semantics.
- Novel factorization of joint probability distribution to model interaction features.
- Uses ST-GCNs and G-GRUs which are data-efficient for modeling human motions.

Main Contributions:
- First deep learning based method for augmenting skeletal motions of two interacting characters with varying body sizes.
- Model can effectively learn from limited data and generalize to unseen body sizes/interactions.  
- Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate accuracy in generating motions, ability to retain interaction constraints, generalizability, and improved sample-efficiency over optimization-based methods.
- New interaction dataset collected with body size variations.
- Demonstrate benefits of augmented data for downstream tasks of motion prediction and activity recognition.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel conditional deep generative model to augment the diversity of two character interaction motions by generating motions conditioned on different body sizes and interaction types. The model is highly data-efficient and outperforms previous optimization and data-driven techniques.
