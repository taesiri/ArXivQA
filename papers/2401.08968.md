# [COCO is "ALL'' You Need for Visual Instruction Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current visual instruction-tuned models like LLaVA-1.5 struggle to follow user instructions properly in multi-round dialog settings. Models tend to overfit to the bias in instruction datasets towards providing short, closed-form responses.
- Traditional caption and VQA benchmarks with closed-form evaluation are not suitable for assessing the capabilities of modern open-ended generative models.

Proposed Solution:  
- Construct a new COCO-image-centric instruction tuning dataset by analyzing and merging high-quality detailed annotations from various existing datasets.
- Retrain LLaVA-1.5 on this proposed dataset to reduce overfitting and improve multi-round dialog capabilities.
- Design a protocol to evaluate models in multi-round dialog by asking additional follow-up questions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposing the new COCO IFT dataset by merging annotations centered around COCO images.
- Showing improved multi-round dialog performance with LLaVA-1.5 fine-tuned on this dataset.
- Demonstrating that a few COCO images with high-quality instructions are sufficient, adding more VQA data leads to overfitting.
- Providing analysis and evidence that current benchmarks are limited in assessing generative models.
- Designing a multi-round protocol to better evaluate open-ended dialog capabilities.

In summary, the key idea is that overfitting to bias during instruction tuning degrades multi-round performance, and this can be reduced by using a small but high-quality instruction dataset based on COCO images. The work also highlights issues with current evaluation practices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes constructing a visual instruction fine-tuning dataset by analyzing and merging annotations for COCO images from multiple sources, showing that high-quality, diversified instructions focused on COCO are sufficient for improving multi-modal language models' instruction following abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Constructing a COCO-image-centric visual instruction fine-tuning dataset by analyzing and merging data from various IFT dataset sources.

2. Retraining LLaVA-1.5 with the proposed dataset, thereby outperforming the official LLaVA-1.5-13B on open-ended evaluation benchmarks. 

3. Designing a protocol to evaluate MLLMs in a multi-round dialog setting.

4. Proving that a few images with high-quality instruction-following annotations are sufficient for IFT, and that adding more GQA or VQA datasets leads to overfitting to in-domain evaluation benchmarks.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that the COCO dataset alone, with high-quality instruction-following annotations, is sufficient for visual instruction fine-tuning of MLLMs. Adding more QA datasets like GQA and VQA actually hurts multi-round dialog performance due to overfitting.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions constructing a COCO-image-centric visual instruction tuning dataset by analyzing and merging data from various sources. What was the rationale behind choosing COCO images as the basis for the new dataset? What advantages does COCO provide over other image datasets?

2. When applying templates to questions for converting datasets into conversational format, the authors tried to keep answers in full sentences rather than single words. What impact would this have on reducing model bias and improving multi-round dialog capability?

3. The final merged instruction tuning dataset contains around 118,000 samples. Was any analysis done on the diversity and coverage of instructions in the final dataset? Are there still gaps that need to be addressed? 

4. Retraining was done on an LLaVA-1.5 model checkpoint. What architectural modifications, if any, were made to the base LLaVA-1.5 model before retraining on the new dataset?

5. The multi-round dialog evaluation protocol designed involves asking a fixed first question unrelated to the image, followed by the actual image-related question. What was the motivation behind this? How does it improve assessment of model capabilities?

6. On the MM-Vet benchmark, the performance drops significantly for the original LLaVA model in multi-round setting on Generation and Knowledge sections. Why does the new model not exhibit these drops?

7. What could be the reasons behind the original LLaVA model's major performance drop on Abductive Reasoning questions in InfiMM-Eval under multi-round dialog? How does the proposed approach address this?

8. What experiments could be designed to further analyze model behavior in multi-round dialog and parameterize bias reduction? Are there other metrics that could complement existing ones?  

9. The conclusion hypothesizes COCO dataset is sufficient for instruction tuning. But could incorporating more out-of-domain data still be beneficial? What kind of analysis could determine optimal ratios?

10. What steps need to be taken towards building better benchmarks for evaluating open-ended generative MLLMs? What functionality should these benchmarks focus on assessing?
