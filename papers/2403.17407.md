# [Transcribing Bengali Text with Regional Dialects to IPA using District   Guided Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurately transcribing Bengali text into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is challenging due to the language's complex phonology and context-dependent sound changes. This difficulty is compounded for regional Bengali dialects which lack spelling standards, contain local/foreign words, and have phonological diversity across districts.

Solution: 
The paper proposes a "District Guided Token" (DGT) technique to enhance sequence-to-sequence models for regional Bangla text-to-IPA transcription. The key idea is to provide the model explicit information about the district of the input text, guiding it to capture unique phonetic patterns of each district. This is done by prepending a district token (e.g. <Dhaka>) to the input sequence.

Contributions:

1) Introduces a new dataset spanning text from 6 districts of Bangladesh for mapping regional dialects to IPA.

2) Proposes the DGT technique to incorporate district (regional dialect) information into models, allowing them to adapt to distinct phonetic rules.

3) Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance by fine-tuning the byte-level transformer model ByT5 with DGTs, outperforming prior word-based models. ByT5 mitigates out-of-vocabulary issues.

4) Provides an approach to handle morphological, phonological, syntactic variations in dialects critical for speech applications. 

5) Showcases the value of supplying auxiliary inputs to aid seq2seq models on complex linguistic tasks.

In summary, the paper presents an effective methodology leveraging district guided tokens to inject regional dialect knowledge into models for improved Bangla text-to-IPA transduction of diverse regional variants.
