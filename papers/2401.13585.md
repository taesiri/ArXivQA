# [Latency vs precision: Stability preserving perception scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of perception latency and precision trade-off in robotic systems. Perception algorithms can be run in different modes with different latencies (time to process data) and precision (noise levels). Longer latency usually results in more precise perceptions. However, longer latency also means the control commands cannot react as fast. There is a need to balance the latency and precision by scheduling different perception modes over time. 

The authors model this problem using a linear robotic system model with process noise. The measurements come from different perception modes with different latencies and noise covariance. The goal is to schedule the perception modes to stabilize the system and optimize a cost function. The cost function balances state deviation cost and perception mode penalties that model latency and computation load.

Proposed Solution: 
The solution has three main components:

1. Construction of perception scheduling policy candidates that can stabilize the system. This is done using switching system theory by finding "admissible" sets of finite perception mode sequences. 

2. An algorithm to verify if a policy candidate is admissible or not. This checks if switching between the allowed mode sequences can contract the state space.

3. Optimal strategy to select between the stabilizing policy candidates to optimize the cost function. A dynamic programming approach evaluates all candidates.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of perception scheduling for latency-precision trade-off as a switching control problem
- Method to construct multiple stabilizing scheduling policy candidates 
- Non-conservative admissibility checking algorithm
- Dynamic programming based optimal selection between policy candidates
- Proof of approximation capability to optimal schedule for sufficient candidates
- Demonstration on double integrator and particle robot examples

The main highlight is the framework to generate stabilizing perception scheduling policies that can be optimized for the latency-precision trade-off. The admissibility checking algorithm and approximation results are also novel contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a framework involving stability analysis of switching systems, admissibility checking algorithms, and optimization techniques to schedule between perception modes with different latencies and noise levels in order to balance control precision and computational load for robotic systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) The development of a framework for optimally scheduling different perception modes in robotic systems to manage the trade-off between perception latency and precision. This includes constructing candidate scheduling policies, verifying their stability, and using them to optimize a cost function capturing control performance and computational/energetic penalties.

2) A new algorithm for non-conservatively checking the admissibility (stability) of candidate scheduling policies. This allows verifying if a policy ensures asymptotic stability of the expected system state.

3) Analysis showing the scheduling problem is NP-hard, as well as results on the approximation capabilities and performance bounds of the proposed sub-optimal scheduling strategies. 

4) Simulation examples demonstrating the application of the scheduling framework to a double integrator system and a particle robot model, comparing the performance to baselines using a fixed perception mode.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be the novel perception scheduling framework and analysis providing tools for managing the latency-precision tradeoff in robotic perception and control systems. Both theoretical and experimental results are used to showcase the utility of the approach.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework with three main components: constructing scheduling policy candidates, admissibility verification, and developing optimal strategies. Can you explain in more detail how these three components work together to solve the overall perception scheduling problem? 

2. The paper introduces the concept of an "admissible set of schedules." What exactly does this mean, why is it important, and how is admissibility determined?

3. Algorithm 2 in the paper outlines a procedure for constructing a set of schedules. Can you walk through this algorithm step-by-step and explain the rationale behind it? How does it differ from a purely combinatorial approach?

4. The paper claims that checking admissibility of a set of schedules is non-trivial. Can you explain the approach proposed in Section IV for verifying admissibility in a non-conservative way? 

5. What is the difference between regular and non-regular critical points in the context of the optimization problem formulated in the paper? How does the analysis handle these two types of critical points?

6. The optimal scheduling solution proposed involves a dynamic programming approach. What is the limitation identified with this approach and what heuristic is suggested to make it tractable?

7. How does the paper model the latency-precision tradeoff in robotic perception systems? What are the key components of the cost function formulation?

8. The stability analysis for the scheduling policies relies heavily on switching systems theory. Can you summarize the key stability result and explain how it relates to the Lyapunov function formulated?

9. What theoretical result relates the performance of the proposed sub-optimal scheduling solution to the globally optimal solution? What assumption enables this performance guarantee? 

10. The simulation example models a double integrator system. Can you explain the specifics of this example and how the results demonstrate the efficacy of the balanced SPS approach?
