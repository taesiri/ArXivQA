# [Stochastic Directly-Follows Process Discovery Using Grammatical   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05433)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Process discovery is the task of constructing a simple process model that describes the underlying process that generated a set of event logs. Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) are a popular process modeling notation used in practice for their intuitiveness. 
- Existing DFG discovery algorithms face challenges with noise, provide no semantics to interpret DFGs as stochastic models, and lack capabilities to explore the solution space effectively to find smaller, more accurate DFGs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a stochastic process discovery approach called GASPD that uses grammatical inference and genetic algorithms. 
- GASPD introduces Stochastic Directed Action Graphs (SDAGs), a variant of DFGs with formal stochastic semantics grounded in stochastic languages. This allows interpreting discovered models probabilistically.
- The grammatical inference algorithm ALERGIA is used to learn SDAGs from event logs. ALERGIA employs two key parameters that control model generalization.
- A genetic algorithm called MOGA evolves the parameters over generations to explore the solution space and discover a diverse set of non-dominated SDAG models forming a Pareto frontier trading off size and accuracy.  

Key Contributions:
- First formal semantics of DFG-variants grounded in stochastic languages
- Genetic Algorithm for Stochastic Process Discovery (GASPD) to discover a family of SDAGs from event logs
- Heuristic to focus search to promising areas and accelerate convergence
- Evaluation over real-life logs showing GASPD can discover smaller and more accurate models compared to state-of-the-art

The key insight is to cast process discovery as a grammatical inference problem and use evolutionary search to explore the solution space effectively. The stochastic semantics allow probabilistic interpretation of DFG-variants. Experiments confirm the benefits of the proposed techniques.
