# ["It's how you do things that matters": Attending to Process to Better   Serve Indigenous Communities with Language Technologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Indigenous languages have been historically under-served by natural language processing (NLP) technologies. As the field expands to include more endangered and under-resourced languages, there is a need to consider how to ethically build NLP technologies to serve Indigenous communities rather than prioritizing research community goals. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors recommend practices for NLP researchers to focus more on the process of engagement with Indigenous communities, questioning assumptions and power dynamics, negotiating shared control over projects, and delivering community benefits - rather than solely creating models or datasets as end goals.

Key Contributions:
- Interviews 17 researchers working with Australian Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander communities on language technology projects to understand strategies and challenges.
- Discusses principles from literature on decolonization of language technology and Indigenous data governance. 
- Proposes practices for ethical engagement, including seeking out community needs, engaging with community bodies, negotiating control of resources, creating opportunities for community benefit in data collection processes, archiving accessible data outputs, and starting small then scaling digital shells across communities.  
- Calls for NLP research community to value process of community engagement, not just model accuracy, to serve Indigenous communities.

In summary, the paper argues NLP researchers should prioritize understanding and negotiating community needs and benefits in order to decolonize language technology development processes to better serve Indigenous peoples. The interviews and literature provide principles toward this goal.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores ethical considerations and recommended practices for natural language processing researchers working with Indigenous languages, based on insights from interviews with 17 researchers working on language technology projects with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper recommends practices for NLP researchers working with Indigenous languages to increase attention to the process of engagements with Indigenous communities, rather than focusing only on decontextualized artifacts. Specifically, it proposes a cyclical process of engagement that involves:

1) Seeking out community needs 
2) Engaging with community representative bodies
3) Negotiating control over project resources and ongoing relationships  
4) Ensuring the process of engagement provides community benefits
5) Storing and maintaining data produced in accessible formats
6) Scaling digital shells across languages

The recommendations aim to contribute to the discourse on the decolonization of language technology by navigating the tension between producing relevant work for local communities versus demands to scale across languages. The paper argues for centering the process of engagement itself as a core component of ethical NLP research with Indigenous communities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Indigenous languages
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Low-resource languages
- Endangered languages
- Decolonization
- Indigenous data governance
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages (in the Australian context)
- Community engagement
- Language technology
- Language revitalization 
- Data sovereignty
- Ethics

The paper discusses strategies and challenges for building NLP technologies for indigenous languages, with a focus on serving the needs and interests of indigenous communities. It explores perspectives from researchers working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups in Australia. The key themes include decolonial approaches to NLP, principles for indigenous data governance, insights from interviews on community engagement practices, and recommendations for centering community needs and relationships.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper recommends practices for NLP researchers working with Indigenous languages. What do you see as the challenges or limitations with operationalizing the recommended practices especially in terms of seeking out community needs?

2. The authors mention the tension between producing research relevant to local communities vs demands of research communities. How can this tension be better managed especially when it comes to deciding on project scope and goals? 

3. The paper talks about scaling digital shells across languages after starting small with 1-2 communities. What factors need to be considered regarding the adaptability of digital shells to new contexts? How can we ensure they appropriately serve different communities?

4. When negotiating control over project resources, what protocols or mechanisms can be put in place for conflict resolution or mediation especially if expectations differ over time? 

5. The authors recommend community ownership and co-ownership of project outcomes. How can issues like long-term governance, maintenance responsibilities, and evolution of systems be addressed?

6. What metrics beyond accuracy benchmarks would be most meaningful for evaluating process of engagement with communities? How can impact on communities be assessed in culturally safe and ethical ways?

7. The authors mention the process of engagement as an opportunity for community benefit. What principles or frameworks could guide co-design of data collection and annotation activities to support capacity building?

8. How can engagement through community representative bodies balance representation across diverse community perspectives and interests over time? What supports or resources would make this more effective?

9. The authors recognize their own limitations and potential biases in analysis. What community-centered validation methods would help mitigate this and strengthen credibility of insights and recommendations? 

10. The authors encourage NLP forum where Indigenous voices articulate needs. What responsible governance mechanisms could support this while avoiding extractive dynamics? What incentives exist for NLP community participation?
