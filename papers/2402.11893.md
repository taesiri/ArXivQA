# [Discerning and Resolving Knowledge Conflicts through Adaptive Decoding   with Contextual Information-Entropy Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11893)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) internalize a lot of parametric knowledge during pre-training. However, they still struggle with less popular factual knowledge and are unable to adapt over time. 
- Applying external contextual knowledge can help LLMs, but this raises the issue of "knowledge conflicts". This refers to clashes between the contextual knowledge and the LLM's internal parametric knowledge.
- Existing conflict-resolving decoding methods could inadvertently hurt performance when no conflicts are present. They presume all contexts have conflicts.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an adaptive decoding method called COntextual Information-Entropy Constraint Decoding (COIECD) to discern whether knowledge conflicts occur and resolve them.

- It uses a "contextual information-entropy constraint" to identify violation tokens that likely indicate conflicts. This constraint bounds the information-entropy shift for tokens.

- For non-conflicting tokens, COIECD utilizes both parametric and contextual knowledge. For conflicting tokens, it prioritizes contextual knowledge. 

- The decoding strategy is formalized based on whether tokens violate the proposed constraint. Distinct strategies are employed.

Main Contributions:
- Presents an effective way to discern knowledge conflicts using the proposed contextual information-entropy constraint.

- Develops tailored decoding strategies to resolve conflicts based on this constraint. 

- Experiments show COIECD significantly improves faithfulness to conflicting contexts while maintaining performance on non-conflicting contexts.

- Achieves strong performance and robustness over diverse datasets and models. Demonstrates consistency across conflict ratios.

In summary, the key innovation is an adaptive decoding method using an information-entropy constraint to identify conflicts and handle them differently to improve faithfulness to context while preserving performance. The method proves very effective across models and tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adaptive decoding method called COntextual Information-Entropy Constraint Decoding (COIECD) to discern knowledge conflicts between language models and contexts, and employs tailored strategies to resolve them, achieving improved performance across diverse models and datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an adaptive decoding method called COntextual Information-Entropy Constraint Decoding (COIECD) to discern and resolve knowledge conflicts between parametric knowledge in large language models (LLMs) and non-parametric contextual knowledge. Specifically, the key highlights are:

1) It presents a contextual information-entropy constraint to discern knowledge conflicts on a token level during decoding. This constraint measures changes in distribution entropy and token information to identify potential conflicts.

2) It develops tailored decoding strategies based on the constraint to resolve conflicts - prioritizing contextual knowledge for identified conflicting tokens and balancing both sources of knowledge for non-conflicting tokens. 

3) Experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate COIECD's effectiveness in improving faithfulness to conflicting contexts while maintaining performance on non-conflicting contexts. It achieves superior and robust performance compared to existing conflict-resolving decoding methods.

In summary, the main contribution is an adaptive decoding method that can discern and resolve knowledge conflicts to improve model faithfulness to conflicting contextual knowledge while preserving performance - something prior conflict-focused decoding methods struggled with.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Knowledge conflicts - The clash between external contextual knowledge and the internal parametric knowledge of large language models. This is a key issue the paper aims to address.

- Contextual information-entropy constraint - The proposed method to discern knowledge conflicts by measuring changes in distribution entropy and bounding the information-entropy shift. This is the core novel technique introduced. 

- Adaptive decoding - The use of tailored decoding strategies based on the contextual constraint to resolve knowledge conflicts. Distinct strategies are used for conflicting and non-conflicting tokens.

- Performance robustness - A key benefit of the proposed COIECD method is its consistent performance improvements and robustness across diverse models, datasets, and conflict scenarios compared to prior approaches.

- Realistic datasets - The paper evaluates on both synthetic conflict data and more realistic hybrid datasets that have an unpredictability of conflict occurrences. This tests model robustness.

- Question answering - The primary set of tasks used to assess the method are reading comprehension style question answering datasets.

So in summary, the key terms cover knowledge conflicts, the constraint-based discernment method, adaptive decoding strategies, performance robustness, realistic data, and question answering.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes discerning knowledge conflicts by measuring changes in token-level distribution entropy. What theories motivate this approach and why is entropy a useful metric for detecting conflicts?

2. The contextual information-entropy constraint delimits both upper and lower probability bounds. What is the motivation behind having both an upper and lower bound? How does each contribute to the overall effectiveness of the approach?

3. The paper employs different decoding strategies for tokens identified as conflicting versus non-conflicting. What is the rationale behind using the contextual contrastive object g(t) differently for these two categories of tokens?

4. How does the proposed COIECD method balance relying on parametric versus contextual knowledge during decoding? What factors determine the weighting between these two knowledge sources?

5. The method is benchmarked extensively on question answering datasets. What modifications might be necessary to apply COIECD to other context-heavy NLP tasks like summarization or translation?

6. The paper demonstrates improved robustness across varying levels of conflicts within datasets. What specifically contributes to the method's consistency regardless of conflict presence/absence? 

7. Ablation studies reveal that removing the lower probability bound degrades performance more severely. Why might this be the case? What role does the lower bound play in steering generations?

8. How does the COIECD framework relate conceptually to other decoding methods like nucleus sampling? What parallels or differences exist in how constraints are applied during decoding?

9. The method relies on computing probability distributions twice during decoding. What are the computational trade-offs associated with this design decision? Could approximations be used?

10. The technique employs an entropy constraint defined specifically for language models. What opportunities exist for transferring this constraint concept to other types of neural networks?
