# [Discerning and Resolving Knowledge Conflicts through Adaptive Decoding   with Contextual Information-Entropy Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11893)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) internalize a lot of parametric knowledge during pre-training. However, they still struggle with less popular factual knowledge and are unable to adapt over time. 
- Applying external contextual knowledge can help LLMs, but this raises the issue of "knowledge conflicts". This refers to clashes between the contextual knowledge and the LLM's internal parametric knowledge.
- Existing conflict-resolving decoding methods could inadvertently hurt performance when no conflicts are present. They presume all contexts have conflicts.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an adaptive decoding method called COntextual Information-Entropy Constraint Decoding (COIECD) to discern whether knowledge conflicts occur and resolve them.

- It uses a "contextual information-entropy constraint" to identify violation tokens that likely indicate conflicts. This constraint bounds the information-entropy shift for tokens.

- For non-conflicting tokens, COIECD utilizes both parametric and contextual knowledge. For conflicting tokens, it prioritizes contextual knowledge. 

- The decoding strategy is formalized based on whether tokens violate the proposed constraint. Distinct strategies are employed.

Main Contributions:
- Presents an effective way to discern knowledge conflicts using the proposed contextual information-entropy constraint.

- Develops tailored decoding strategies to resolve conflicts based on this constraint. 

- Experiments show COIECD significantly improves faithfulness to conflicting contexts while maintaining performance on non-conflicting contexts.

- Achieves strong performance and robustness over diverse datasets and models. Demonstrates consistency across conflict ratios.

In summary, the key innovation is an adaptive decoding method using an information-entropy constraint to identify conflicts and handle them differently to improve faithfulness to context while preserving performance. The method proves very effective across models and tasks.
