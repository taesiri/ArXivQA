# [Mitigating Fine-Grained Hallucination by Fine-Tuning Large   Vision-Language Models with Caption Rewrites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01701)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ReCaption, a novel framework to mitigate fine-grained object hallucination in instruction-tuned large vision-language models (LVLMs). ReCaption has two main components: rewriting image captions using ChatGPT via a two-stage prompting strategy, and additional training of LVLMs on the rewritten captions to strengthen image-text alignment. To evaluate ReCaption's effectiveness, the authors introduce a new fine-grained probing-based evaluation method called Fine-Grained Object Hallucination Evaluation (FGHE) which measures hallucinated object attributes and behaviors. Experiments conducted on various LVLMs like mPLUG-Owl, LLaVA, MultiModal-GPT and MiniGPT-4 demonstrate that integrating ReCaption significantly reduces fine-grained hallucinations and improves text generation quality across models. The proposed framework is model-agnostic and evaluation using both FGHE and the existing POPE metric shows substantial gains over baseline LVLMs. The work highlights the promise of leveraging high-quality rewritten captions to enhance visual grounding and reasoning in LVLMs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show impressive capabilities in generating text descriptions for images. However, they suffer from object hallucination, generating non-existent objects or incorrect object details.
- Existing methods only evaluate coarse-grained object hallucination, overlooking fine-grained hallucination regarding object attributes and behaviors.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ReCaption, a framework with two components:
   1) Rewriting image captions using ChatGPT via a two-stage prompting strategy to extract keywords and generate diverse captions.
   2) Fine-tuning LVLMs on the rewritten captions to enhance fine-grained image-text alignment.

- To evaluate fine-grained hallucination, the paper also proposes Fine-Grained Object Hallucination Evaluation (FGHE) method. FGHE creates probing questions on object relations, attributes and behaviors.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes ReCaption, a general framework to reduce fine-grained hallucination by fine-tuning LVLMs on rewritten captions.
- Introduces FGHE, a probing-based method to evaluate fine-grained object hallucination.
- Experiments show ReCaption reduces hallucination and improves caption quality for various LVLMs. The code and data are available.

In summary, this paper focuses on mitigating and evaluating fine-grained object hallucination in LVLMs. The key innovation is the ReCaption framework and FGHE evaluation method. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReCaption in hallucination reduction for different LVLMs.
