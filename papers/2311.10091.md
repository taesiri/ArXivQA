## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents an approach for efficiently rendering neural radiance fields (NeRFs) by restricting volumetric rendering to a narrow band around the object surface. The method first trains a NeRF with a spatially-varying kernel that adapts to be large in fuzzy volumetric regions like hair and small in regions with sharp surfaces. This kernel is used to extract an explicit mesh envelope enclosing the region that contributes significantly to rendering. At inference time, rays are traced against this mesh to skip empty space and only sample the radiance field within the enclosed narrow band. For surface-like regions, the narrow band allows rendering from just one sample, while more samples are used for fuzzy volumes. Experiments validate that this formulation enables very efficient high-fidelity rendering across diverse data. The extracted mesh envelope also facilitates applications like animation and simulation. Overall, the proposed technique achieves real-time performance while maintaining or even improving NeRF rendering quality by adapting the representation and sampling to the local complexity of the scene.
