# [DataFrame QA: A Universal LLM Framework on DataFrame Question Answering   Without Data Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional methods of using LLMs for table QA embed the entire table content in prompts, raising issues with data privacy, model context limits, and computational costs. 
- Loading large tables into prompts is inefficient compared to text due to the 2D structure and data density.
- There is a need for a new approach to enable LLMs to query dataframes without exposing sensitive data.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduces a new DataFrame QA task and framework focused on generating Pandas data queries using only dataframe headers and column data types, without accessing actual values.
- Eliminates data privacy risks and reduces prompt size to fit model context windows.  
- Enriches prompts with dataset descriptions and column formats to improve contextual understanding.
- Evaluates performance of latest LLMs like GPT-4 in generating Pandas queries for data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the DataFrame QA task requiring models to convert natural language questions into Pandas queries using just dataframe metadata.
- Creates the UCI-DataFrameQA dataset with complex analysis questions across domains.
- Demonstrates GPT-4's effectiveness in achieving 86% and 97% pass@1 accuracy on WikiSQL and UCI datasets respectively. 
- Provides analysis of error patterns and challenges in the DataFrame QA task.
- Establishes a secure and efficient approach to query dataframes with LLMs without exposing sensitive data.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel DataFrame QA framework that uses LLMs and dataframe headers to generate Pandas queries, overcoming key limitations around model context, data privacy and computational efficiency compared to existing table QA techniques.
