# [Generalizable Neural Physics Solvers by Baldwinian Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03243)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach called Baldwinian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) for evolving neural networks that can rapidly adapt to solve a variety of physics problems. Inspired by the Baldwin effect in evolution, where learned adaptations become genetically assimilated over generations, B-PINNs incorporate both evolutionary optimization and lifetime learning. Specifically, an evolutionary algorithm searches the space of network architectures and learning hyperparameters to find networks with inherent biases towards efficiently learning the physics tasks. The lifetime learning stage then allows the network to quickly specialize to a particular unseen physics problem by solving a least squares problem. Experiments on various physics problems like convection-diffusion equations, reaction-diffusion systems, and particle kinematics demonstrate that B-PINNs can make accurate predictions on new tasks orders of magnitude faster than prior meta-learning techniques for PINNs. The key innovation is in framing PINN meta-learning as a two-stage stochastic program amenable to Baldwinian evolution. This provides a pathway towards more generalizable physics-aware neural network models that approach the versatility and efficiency of precocial species in assimilating new knowledge.
