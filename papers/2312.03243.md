# [Generalizable Neural Physics Solvers by Baldwinian Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03243)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach called Baldwinian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) for evolving neural networks that can rapidly adapt to solve a variety of physics problems. Inspired by the Baldwin effect in evolution, where learned adaptations become genetically assimilated over generations, B-PINNs incorporate both evolutionary optimization and lifetime learning. Specifically, an evolutionary algorithm searches the space of network architectures and learning hyperparameters to find networks with inherent biases towards efficiently learning the physics tasks. The lifetime learning stage then allows the network to quickly specialize to a particular unseen physics problem by solving a least squares problem. Experiments on various physics problems like convection-diffusion equations, reaction-diffusion systems, and particle kinematics demonstrate that B-PINNs can make accurate predictions on new tasks orders of magnitude faster than prior meta-learning techniques for PINNs. The key innovation is in framing PINN meta-learning as a two-stage stochastic program amenable to Baldwinian evolution. This provides a pathway towards more generalizable physics-aware neural network models that approach the versatility and efficiency of precocial species in assimilating new knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called Baldwinian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) that uses principles from evolution and lifetime learning to efficiently meta-learn physics-based neural network models capable of fast, accurate, and generalizable predictions across families of differential equations representing diverse physical systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called "Baldwinian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs)" for meta-learning of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Specifically:

1) The paper formulates the meta-learning of PINNs that can generalize across families of differential equations as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem inspired by the Baldwin effect in evolution. 

2) It proposes an algorithmic realization of neural Baldwinism for PINNs, which couples evolutionary optimization to search for optimized network architectures and learning algorithms, with fast physics-based lifetime learning to specialize the model to specific tasks. 

3) Through experiments on various physics problems (ODEs/PDEs), it demonstrates that the evolved B-PINNs can achieve much faster (orders of magnitude) and more accurate prediction on unseen tasks compared to recent meta-learned PINNs.

In summary, the key innovation is a new Baldwinian evolution paradigm for meta-learning generalizable physics-informed neural networks by imitating the biological Baldwin effect. The results show significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.
