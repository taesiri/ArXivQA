# [Brainformer: Modeling MRI Brain Functions to Machine Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00236)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent advances in computer vision models rely on large-scale supervised pretraining, which is limited by the need for expensive annotation. Alternatively, vision-language models trained on image-text pairs demonstrate impressive zero-shot capabilities but do not capture the dynamics of human visual perception and cognition. 

Approach:
This paper proposes Brainformer, a novel framework to analyze fMRI signals representing human brain activity as a supervisory signal to enhance computer vision models. The key ideas are:

1) Encode fMRI signals from regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain using Conv1D layers and a novel 3D voxel embedding to preserve spatial structure. 

2) Apply a Multi-scale Transformer on ROI encodings to uncover patterns within and between brain regions during visual tasks.

3) Develop a Brain fMRI Guidance loss to align local visual features from the model with corresponding ROI brain activity features.

4) Jointly optimize for contrastive learning between global visual and fMRI features along with the Brain fMRI Guidance loss.

Main Contributions:

1) Brainformer framework to uncover ROI-specific patterns and interactions from fMRI signals during visual recognition.

2) Novel 3D voxel embedding and Multi-scale Transformer tailored for fMRI data.

3) Brain fMRI Guidance loss to transfer fine-grained human perception patterns into the vision model.

4) State-of-the-art performance on object detection, segmentation and brain encoding tasks by leveraging Brainformer's supervisory fMRI signal.

5) Demonstrate feasibility and benefits of using human brain activity to enhance computer vision models.

The key insight is to leverage fMRI as a rich supervisory signal that captures the dynamics of human visual perception for training better vision models. Experiments validate Brainformer's abilities on multiple vision tasks.
