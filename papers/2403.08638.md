# [Disparate Effect Of Missing Mediators On Transportability of Causal   Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Transporting causal effects from one population (source) to another (target) is important but challenging when there are differences between the populations. A key issue is missing mediator data in the target population. 
- Mediators (e.g. individual behaviors) often mediate the effect of distal/upstream factors (e.g. neighborhood conditions) on outcomes (e.g. health).
- Missing mediator data can bias transported causal effect estimates, especially for disadvantaged subgroups if missingness depends on distal factors. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about an intervention's effectiveness when transported.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a framework to quantify the impact of missing mediator data on transported causal effects, specifically the indirect mediated effect. 
- Propose variance-based sensitivity models parameterized by $R^2$ (degree of residual error in weights due to missing mediators).
- Derive confidence intervals on mediated indirect effect that capture impact of missingness.
- Apply framework to quantify maximum missingness before transported effect becomes insignificant, and compare impact on disadvantaged vs advantaged subgroups.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework for sensitivity analysis of missing mediator data on transported causal effects.
- Quantify bounds on mediated indirect effect as a function of missingness.   
- Demonstrate disparate impact of missingness on disadvantaged vs advantaged subgroups in both simulated and real-world data.
- Find missingness thresholds beyond which transmitted causal conclusions change qualitatively differently for disadvantaged subgroups.
- Provide practitioners concrete guidance on robustness of conclusions to missing mediator data when transporting effects.

In summary, the paper develops helpful statistical machinery to assess the sensitivity of transported causal effect estimates to missing mediator data, especially for understanding and mitigating the greater impact this can have on conclusions regarding disadvantaged subpopulations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the impact of missing mediator data, which can be missing not at random, on transported causal mediation effects, showing that the effect can become insignificant for disadvantaged subgroups when missingness exceeds a threshold.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the impact of missing mediator data on transported causal mediation effects. Specifically, the paper:

- Focuses on the problem of missing mediator data when transporting causal effects from a source to target environment. It argues that mediators like individual behaviors are often inconsistently measured, resulting in missing data, which can bias transported causal effect estimates.

- Introduces variance-based sensitivity models parameterized by an R^2 measure representing the degree of residual error in the weights used to estimate the transported indirect effect due to missing mediators. 

- Shows in simulations that the transported indirect causal effect can become insignificant for disadvantaged subgroups when missingness in the mediator increases beyond a threshold.

- Applies the framework to analyze the effect of missing parental health data (mediator) on the effect of moving to a better neighborhood on child mental health outcomes using data from the Moving to Opportunity study. The results demonstrate that the transported effect becomes insignificant for disadvantaged subgroups as missingness increases.

So in summary, the key contribution is a sensitivity analysis framework to assess the impact of missing mediator data on transported causal mediation effects, with applications to quantify disparities for disadvantaged groups.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Transportability of causal effects - Generalizing experimental findings from a source to target population. Estimating treatment effects in a new target population based on data from a source population.

- Missing mediators - Mediators are variables that mediate the effect of a treatment on an outcome. Missing mediators refers to the problem when mediator data is not fully observed in the target population.

- Sensitivity analysis - Analyzing how sensitive the estimates of treatment effects are to missing mediator data. Quantifying the impact of missing mediator data.

- Disparate impact - The missing mediator data can have a disparate impact on transported effect estimates for disadvantaged versus advantaged subgroups. 

- Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study - A housing voucher experiment used as an empirical example to demonstrate the methodology.

Some other terms: causal graphs, selection bias, stochastic intervention effects, targeted minimum loss estimation, confidence intervals.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a variance-based sensitivity analysis framework to assess the impact of missing mediator data on transported causal effects. How is this framework derived and what assumptions does it rely on? 

2. The paper focuses on quantifying the bias between the sample average treatment effect (SATE) and the population average treatment effect (PATE) under missing mediator data. How does missing mediator data specifically impact this bias quantification and why is this an open research problem?

3. The targeted minimum loss-based estimator (TMLE) is adapted in this paper for estimating transported causal effects under missing mediator data. What modifications were made to the typical TMLE procedure to account for the missing data and selection bias?

4. What is the motivation behind assessing the impact of missing mediators on transportability specifically for disadvantaged versus advantaged subgroups? How could disparate proportions of missing data for these subgroups lead to biased inferences?  

5. The paper analyzes simulated and real-world data. What were the key findings from the simulation analysis in terms of how increasing proportions of missing mediator data can lead to heterogeneous indirect effects across subgroups?

6. For the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study analysis, how was missingness induced in the mediator of overall parental health and how did this missingness render the transported causal effects insignificant?

7. What assumptions were made about the missingness pattern of the mediator data and what are some ways to relax this assumption in future work?

8. How do the results depend on the assumed causal graph relating treatment, mediators, outcomes and missingness indicators? What other causal structures could be considered?  

9. What are some limitations of relying solely on complete case analysis when mediator data is missing not at random? How could multiple imputation procedures help address these challenges?

10. What other transportability settings with missing mediator data merit future investigation? For example, scenarios with unmeasured confounding between the treatment, mediators, and outcome.
