# [Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital   Problems using Koopman Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling and propagating the complex nonlinear dynamics of orbital mechanics problems like the Two-Body Problem (2BP) and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) is very challenging. Current methods for linearization of these systems have significant limitations and assumptions.
- There is a need for an accurate, fast, and globally valid linear approximation of such orbital dynamics for advanced and efficient guidance, navigation and control.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use a deep neural network (DNN) based framework to learn a global Koopman operator that linearly approximates the nonlinear dynamics of the orbital systems. The Koopman operator is able to capture all properties of the original nonlinear system in its linear representation.

- The DNN architecture uses a custom loss function, regularization techniques, and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition to learn the lifting observable functions and the Koopman operator matrix.

- The method is applied to circular orbits in the 2BP system centered around the Earth, as well as to periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon CR3BP system near the L1 Lagrange point.

Key Contributions:

- First demonstration of global linearization of both the 2BP dynamics and the CR3BP using the proposed Koopman learning framework.

- For 2BP, the method accurately predicts circular orbits in systems centered around Earth, Moon and Jupiter without additional training. The largest position error is only 3km for Earth orbits. Important invariant properties are preserved.

- For CR3BP, the method approximates the intricate nonlinear periodic dynamics rather well. The relative error in the conserved Jacobi constant is less than 12.7%.

- The learned linear time-invariant models allow easy analysis and application of controls methods like proving stability, controllability etc.

- The proposed framework has significant advantages over existing linearization techniques and opens up new possibilities for orbit control and estimation tasks.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in globally linearizing complex orbital mechanics problems using data-driven deep learning of Koopman operators. The accuracy demonstrated has useful implications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of the two-body problem and circular restricted three-body problem dynamics using deep learning-based Koopman theory.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are twofold:

1. The authors demonstrate the ability of the learned Koopman operator to globally linearize the Circular Two-Body Problem for a range of Earth orbits from 200-30,000 km altitude. They also show that the same network can generalize to linearize circular orbits around other central bodies like the Moon and Jupiter, without additional training.

2. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their Koopman operator framework to the more complex Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Specifically, they globally linearize a periodic orbit near the L1 Lagrange point in the Earth-Moon system. They analyze the accuracy by studying the conservation of the Jacobi constant.

In summary, the paper shows that the proposed deep learning based Koopman operator framework can effectively learn global linear models of both the circular two-body and restricted three-body orbital problems from data. A key contribution is demonstrating generalization capability to new central bodies without retraining.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the Koopman operator is approximated using EDMD with deep neural networks. How does the use of deep neural networks for learning the observable functions compare to selecting them manually as a dictionary in traditional EDMD? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

2. In the loss function design (Equation 8), the paper uses both L1 and L2 regularization. Explain the differences between these regularization techniques and why both were selected for use in this application. How do they aid in learning an accurate Koopman operator?

3. The deep neural network uses the SELU activation function. Why was this activation function chosen over other common activation functions like ReLU? How does the choice of activation function impact model performance?

4. The paper demonstrates the ability of the learned Koopman operator to generalize to other two body systems like the Moon and Jupiter without retraining. What properties allow it to generalize so effectively? Why does the model perform slightly worse on larger mass central bodies?

5. For the circular restricted three body problem, the model uses a much larger lifted state space dimension (100 vs 6). Explain why a higher dimensional lift was necessary and how that impacts model accuracy and training time. 

6. Analyze the accuracy metrics used for the two body problem, including the relative error formulas. Why are these specific invariant quantities useful for validating model performance and how well do the results demonstrate conservation of dynamical properties?

7. The model achieves excellent performance on the two body problem but slightly higher relative error for the CR3BP. Propose some ideas to further improve the accuracy of the CR3BP model through changes to the network architecture, training process, or other elements.

8. The model transforms complex nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Discuss some of the advantages this enables compared to traditional nonlinear dynamic propagations and how it could be utilized in guidance, navigation and control applications.

9. The paper mentions the model could be expanded to include perturbations like drag or solar pressure. How difficult do you expect it would be to learn an accurate Koopman operator for these more complex dynamics? Would the current network design need to be modified?

10. In addition to the future work mentioned, propose some other ways the method could be expanded, such as different applications, alternate network architectures, or embedding it within a full control framework. What challenges might these entail?
