# [Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital   Problems using Koopman Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08965)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling and propagating the complex nonlinear dynamics of orbital mechanics problems like the Two-Body Problem (2BP) and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) is very challenging. Current methods for linearization of these systems have significant limitations and assumptions.
- There is a need for an accurate, fast, and globally valid linear approximation of such orbital dynamics for advanced and efficient guidance, navigation and control.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use a deep neural network (DNN) based framework to learn a global Koopman operator that linearly approximates the nonlinear dynamics of the orbital systems. The Koopman operator is able to capture all properties of the original nonlinear system in its linear representation.

- The DNN architecture uses a custom loss function, regularization techniques, and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition to learn the lifting observable functions and the Koopman operator matrix.

- The method is applied to circular orbits in the 2BP system centered around the Earth, as well as to periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon CR3BP system near the L1 Lagrange point.

Key Contributions:

- First demonstration of global linearization of both the 2BP dynamics and the CR3BP using the proposed Koopman learning framework.

- For 2BP, the method accurately predicts circular orbits in systems centered around Earth, Moon and Jupiter without additional training. The largest position error is only 3km for Earth orbits. Important invariant properties are preserved.

- For CR3BP, the method approximates the intricate nonlinear periodic dynamics rather well. The relative error in the conserved Jacobi constant is less than 12.7%.

- The learned linear time-invariant models allow easy analysis and application of controls methods like proving stability, controllability etc.

- The proposed framework has significant advantages over existing linearization techniques and opens up new possibilities for orbit control and estimation tasks.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in globally linearizing complex orbital mechanics problems using data-driven deep learning of Koopman operators. The accuracy demonstrated has useful implications.
