# [Control flow in active inference systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.1514)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: How can control flow in systems that execute active inference be formally represented and classified?More specifically, the paper aims to show that control flow in active inference systems that are compliant with the free energy principle can always be represented using tensor networks. The key hypothesis is that the factorization conditions that allow construction of a tensor network are the same as those needed to identify distinct, conditionally independent sets of data on the system's Markov blanket, which enables identification of distinct "objects" or "features" in the environment. The paper then explores some implications of this tensor network representation for modeling biological control systems across scales, from molecular pathways to organismal communities. Key goals are to provide a general framework to characterize context dependence in active inference systems of any scale, and to develop a principled classification of control architectures based on properties like hierarchical depth and entanglement.So in summary, the central research question is how to formally represent control flow in active inference systems using tensor networks in order to enable classification and modeling of biological control systems across scales. The key hypothesis is that tensor network representations rely on the same conditional independence conditions as distinguishing objects/features, providing a unified framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a general framework for modeling control flow in systems that can be described by the free energy principle. The key contributions are:1. It shows that control flow in such systems can always be represented as a tensor network (TN). This allows classifying control architectures based on properties like hierarchical depth and location of unitary operations.2. It proves that the tensor representing control flow can be factored into a TN if and only if the system can distinguish distinct features or objects in its environment. This links the structure of the TN to the observational capabilities of the system.3. It describes how TNs can be implemented using topological quantum neural networks, which allow both classical and quantum representations. This provides a scale-free formalism applicable to biological systems.4. It analyzes biological examples like cells, tissues, and neural networks in terms of their potential TN architectures. This suggests how ideas like spatial locality and compositional structure could emerge from the control flow topology.5. It proposes experimental approaches to elucidate biological control pathways based on classifying them into TN architectures. This could uncover new structure-function relationships.In summary, the key insight is that tensor factorization topology provides a unified language for describing, classifying and analyzing control systems across scales, from quantum to biological. This opens new perspectives on the physics and cognitive science of living systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of control flow in active inference systems:- The paper takes a very theoretical and formal approach by representing control flow using tensor networks and proving that this representation is always possible. This level of mathematical rigor is quite uncommon in the active inference literature, which tends to be more conceptual. - Most active inference papers focus on neuroscience or cognitive science applications. In contrast, this paper aims to provide a general framework applicable to any biological system. The scale-free approach is novel and connects active inference to fundamental physics principles.- There has been limited prior work examining quantum effects or topological frameworks in active inference. By connecting active inference to quantum reference frames, topological quantum field theories, and topological quantum neural networks, this paper explores new territory. - The hierarchical classification of control architectures using tensor networks is original. Most active inference models have focused on the computational aspects without providing a general taxonomy of systems based on control flow topology.- The paper relates control flow topology to the ability to represent concepts like locality and mereology. This moves beyond typical active inference models that just aim to perform inference, to considering deeper philosophical issues about how systems construct reality.- The emphasis on context sensitivity and non-commuting operations is fairly unique in active inference. Most models have not delved into these fundamental quantum-like aspects of contextuality.Overall, this paper pushes active inference into new directions by connecting it to quantum information concepts, providing a mathematical classification of control architectures, and examining the deeper issues behind how context is represented. This expands active inference into a more cross-disciplinary framework.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Further exploring the connections between tensor networks and topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), and using TQFTs to model biological control systems at multiple scales. They suggest this could help further integrate physics, biology, and cognitive science.- Using tensor network architectures to classify and analyze control pathways in biological systems like cells, tissues, organisms, and multi-organism communities. This includes relating network architecture to the observational capabilities of a system.- Applying the tensor network representation of control flow to experimental design and modeling in biology, such as for understanding morphogenesis, collective cell behavior, and navigating problem spaces.- Investigating quantum biology and possible roles of quantum coherence in mammalian physiology and cognition, perhaps using the framework of topological quantum neural networks. - Exploring the possibility of "linguistic" context effects in biological systems due to ambiguities or mismatches between incoming signals and internal models. This could have implications for immunology, developmental biology, and more.- Continuing to develop the free energy principle as a general theoretical framework that integrates physics, biology, cognition, and beyond. Expanding the connections to machine learning methods.In summary, they propose a variety of ways to build on their formalism for modeling control systems and context sensitivity across scales, with potential impacts on diverse fields. The key unifying themes seem to be integrating disciplines, applying tensor network architectures, and elucidating quantum effects in biology.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a theoretical framework for modeling control flow in active inference systems that are trying to minimize free energy. It shows that the control flow in such systems can always be represented as a tensor network (TN), provided certain conditional independence conditions are met that allow the system to identify distinct objects or features in its environment. The topological structure of the TN provides a way to classify different control architectures, ranging from simple cycles to complex hierarchical structures like MERA. After introducing the free energy principle and active inference, the authors represent control flow using attractor dynamics, quantum reference frames, and topological quantum field theory. They then prove that control flow tensors can always be factored into TNs, which requires the existence of decoherent subsystems. Examples of TN structures representing different timescales and hierarchies of control are provided. The relationship between TN structures and topological quantum neural networks is discussed, showing how the latter can implement the former. Implications for biological systems are considered, since TNs allow different levels of complexity, context-dependence, and spacetime representations. Overall, the paper offers a formal and generalizable approach to modeling control flows in embodied inference systems across scales.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper: The paper presents a framework for modeling control flow in active inference systems that comply with the free energy principle (FEP). It shows how control flow in such systems can be formally described using tensor networks (TNs), which provide a general classification of control architectures. The paper first reviews how the FEP applies to systems that maintain their identity over time by acting to minimize variational free energy. It presents three perspectives on modeling control flow - as transitions between attractors on a state manifold, transitions between quantum reference frames, and transitions described by topological quantum field theories. It then proves that control flow can always be represented as a TN contraction if conditional independence conditions are met that allow features of the environment to be distinguished. Properties of the TN architecture such as depth and unitary components reflect properties of the control system like hierarchical levels and detectable entanglement. Example TNs are shown that can be implemented by neural network architectures. The paper discusses implications for modeling biological control systems, arguing linguistic context effects seen in humans may also be relevant for cellular regulation. It suggests the TN formalism will be useful for integrating physical, biological and cognitive modeling.In summary, this paper provides a unifying tensor network framework for modeling control flow and situated, context-dependent behavior in active inference systems across scales. It connects the free energy principle to notions of quantum and topological computation. The tensor network representation enables classifying control architectures and relating them to observational capabilities. This provides a formal foundation for cross-disciplinary modeling of biological systems and cognition.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces a general formalism to represent control flow in active inference systems that are compliant with the free energy principle. The authors show that the control flow in such systems can always be represented by a tensor network (TN), provided that there are conditionally independent sets of data on the Markov blanket boundary separating the system from its environment. They prove this by showing that the factorization conditions that allow construction of a TN are the same as those that allow identification of distinct, mutually conditionally independent features or objects in the environment. This allows using the topological structures of TNs to classify control architectures of active inference systems at any scale, from cells and organisms to communities. The paper illustrates this with some examples and shows how TN architectures correlate with the system's observational capabilities related to detecting locality and mereology. It also discusses how the tensor representation can be used to classify biological control pathways and design experiments.
