# [AutoRecon: Automated 3D Object Discovery and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08810)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key points of the paper are:- The paper proposes a fully automated framework named AutoRecon for 3D object discovery and reconstruction from multi-view images without any manual annotation. - The core idea is to first perform coarse decomposition to segment the foreground object from the scene point cloud reconstructed by SfM. This is done by leveraging self-supervised ViT features and a lightweight Transformer model trained with automatically generated pseudo labels. - Then in the second stage, the foreground object is reconstructed by learning a decomposed neural scene representation, with explicit supervision from the coarse segmentation results to separate the foreground object from background.- The main research question addressed is: How to automatically discover and reconstruct a clean 3D model of the salient foreground object from an object-centric video, without any manual annotation?- The key hypothesis is that by first performing coarse segmentation on the SfM point cloud, then using that as supervision to guide the decomposition and reconstruction of a neural scene representation, the framework can robustly separate and reconstruct the foreground object in a fully automated manner.In summary, the paper aims to tackle the problem of fully automated 3D object discovery and reconstruction from multi-view images, with the core ideas of coarse-to-fine decomposition and using self-supervised ViT features to enable unsupervised object segmentation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
