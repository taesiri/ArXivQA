# [AutoRecon: Automated 3D Object Discovery and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08810)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key points of the paper are:- The paper proposes a fully automated framework named AutoRecon for 3D object discovery and reconstruction from multi-view images without any manual annotation. - The core idea is to first perform coarse decomposition to segment the foreground object from the scene point cloud reconstructed by SfM. This is done by leveraging self-supervised ViT features and a lightweight Transformer model trained with automatically generated pseudo labels. - Then in the second stage, the foreground object is reconstructed by learning a decomposed neural scene representation, with explicit supervision from the coarse segmentation results to separate the foreground object from background.- The main research question addressed is: How to automatically discover and reconstruct a clean 3D model of the salient foreground object from an object-centric video, without any manual annotation?- The key hypothesis is that by first performing coarse segmentation on the SfM point cloud, then using that as supervision to guide the decomposition and reconstruction of a neural scene representation, the framework can robustly separate and reconstruct the foreground object in a fully automated manner.In summary, the paper aims to tackle the problem of fully automated 3D object discovery and reconstruction from multi-view images, with the core ideas of coarse-to-fine decomposition and using self-supervised ViT features to enable unsupervised object segmentation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a fully automated framework for reconstructing background-free 3D object models from multi-view images, without requiring any manual annotation. 2. It presents a coarse-to-fine pipeline for scene decomposition. It first segments the foreground object from an SfM point cloud to get a coarse decomposition. Then it uses this to guide the decomposition of a neural scene representation for reconstructing the object.3. It develops a 3D segmentation Transformer to segment the SfM point cloud and generates training data for it using an unsupervised segmentation pipeline based on Normalized Cuts.4. It demonstrates the capability of the method to automatically create datasets with 3D models, bounding boxes and segmentation masks on challenging real-world datasets like CO3D, BlendedMVS and DTU.In summary, the key contribution is a fully automated pipeline for discovering and reconstructing salient 3D objects from multi-view images without any human annotation. The coarse-to-fine decomposition strategy and the unsupervised segmentation method to enable training are the main technical novelties proposed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of automatically creating annotated 3D object datasets.
