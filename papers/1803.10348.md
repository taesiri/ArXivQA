# Structural inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can context encoders be improved to better complete/reconstruct complex structures for image inpainting? The authors note that while context encoders (CEs) introduced by Pathak et al. show promising ability to complete complex image structures compared to patch-based methods, they still struggle with certain structural inpainting cases. The main hypothesis appears to be:Using perceptual losses based on deep features, rather than just pixel-level losses, will allow context encoders to better learn to complete complex structures for inpainting.The key ideas proposed and investigated are:- Replacing the pixel reconstruction + adversarial losses used to train CEs with a "structural loss" based on deep perceptual features from a VGG network.- Showing this structural loss leads to improved completion of shapes, lines, and junctions compared to a pixel loss.- Using adversarial loss in a second stage of training to refine texture details.- Demonstrating their improved CE architecture yields superior inpainting results on a variety of image datasets compared to the original CE, especially for reconstructing structures.So in summary, the main research question is how to improve context encoders for structural image inpainting, with the key hypothesis being that using perceptual losses will help address this. The experiments aim to demonstrate and validate this hypothesis.
