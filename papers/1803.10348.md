# [Structural inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10348)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can context encoders be improved to better complete/reconstruct complex structures for image inpainting? 

The authors note that while context encoders (CEs) introduced by Pathak et al. show promising ability to complete complex image structures compared to patch-based methods, they still struggle with certain structural inpainting cases. 

The main hypothesis appears to be:

Using perceptual losses based on deep features, rather than just pixel-level losses, will allow context encoders to better learn to complete complex structures for inpainting.

The key ideas proposed and investigated are:

- Replacing the pixel reconstruction + adversarial losses used to train CEs with a "structural loss" based on deep perceptual features from a VGG network.

- Showing this structural loss leads to improved completion of shapes, lines, and junctions compared to a pixel loss.

- Using adversarial loss in a second stage of training to refine texture details.

- Demonstrating their improved CE architecture yields superior inpainting results on a variety of image datasets compared to the original CE, especially for reconstructing structures.

So in summary, the main research question is how to improve context encoders for structural image inpainting, with the key hypothesis being that using perceptual losses will help address this. The experiments aim to demonstrate and validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing modifications to the context encoder architecture for improved structural inpainting. The key points are:

- The original context encoder by Pathak et al. struggles with reconstructing complex structures, even though it is good at textures. 

- Replacing the pixel reconstruction + adversarial loss with a perceptual reconstruction loss based on deep features helps the context encoder better complete structures while maintaining coherence.

- Further adding adversarial training focused on texture realism as a second stage improves results. 

- The proposed context encoder with these modifications outperforms the original on reconstructing structures in a variety of scenes, as demonstrated qualitatively and via a user study.

- This structural context encoder can be combined with optimization-based neural patch refinement for high quality inpainting.

In summary, the main contribution is improving context encoders for structural inpainting by using a perceptual loss and two-stage training, while showing the limitations of the original context encoder. The modified encoder also enables better neural patch-based refinement.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes modifications to context encoders, a deep learning approach for image inpainting, to improve their ability to reconstruct complex structures by using perceptual losses and careful adversarial training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper on structural inpainting compares to other research in this field:

- This paper builds on the recent work of Pathak et al. on context encoders for image inpainting. It identifies some limitations of the original context encoder approach, especially for reconstructing complex structures, and proposes modifications to improve structure completion. 

- The main innovations are using a perceptual loss rather than pixel loss for training the context encoder, and carefully incorporating adversarial training only at a later stage to refine textures. This improves structure reconstruction while still giving naturalistic results.

- Compared to traditional patch-based inpainting methods, this approach can handle more complex structures and scenes by leveraging learned features from the context encoder. However, it is still limited in highly semantic scenes.

- Other deep learning inpainting works have used shape priors, GANs, and attention mechanisms. This paper sticks to a simple encoder-decoder architecture but shows it can be improved with proper training losses.

- A nice contribution is analyzing the context actually needed by their method - finding that just 4-8 pixels from the hole border is often enough. This suggests the approach is not very semantic.

- Optimization-based refinement after the context encoder, as proposed by Yang et al., is shown to further improve results. So this method can complement existing inpainting pipelines.

- Overall, the approach seems to advance structure completion abilities compared to previous context encoder works, while having a simple and clean methodology. But there is still much room for improvement in highly complex scenes lacking any semantics.

In summary, the paper provides useful, incremental innovations in training and losses to boost the structure reconstruction performance of context encoders for inpainting. But high-level scene understanding remains a major challenge.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing deeper use of automatic scene understanding and semantics in context encoders for inpainting. The current scene-agnostic approach is limited in its ability to reconstruct very complex scenes. Incorporating more semantic understanding could improve results.

- Relaxing the current geometric constraints, such as inpainting only a central square region. Allowing more flexible inpainting domains could make the method more widely usable. 

- Incorporating user input seamlessly, for example through scribbles or hints about scene content. This could guide the inpainting and handle cases where semantic understanding is lacking.

- Exploring conditional context encoders that leverage additional images of the same scene or similar scenes during training and/or testing. This could provide more tailored priors.

- Applying the ideas more broadly to video inpainting, leveraging temporal coherence over frames.

- Developing specialized training regimes or network architectures for particular scene types where inpainting is very challenging (e.g. faces).

- Combining semantic inpainting and texture/structure inpainting in a principled joint formulation.

- Improving texture synthesis and detail generation, which is still a weakness.

In summary, the main open problems appear to be better leveraging semantics, flexibility in inpainting geometry, user guidance, and improving texture realism. Applying the approach to video is also noted as an important direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes modifications to the context encoder neural network architecture for image inpainting. The context encoder introduced by Pathak et al. uses an encoder-decoder architecture and adversarial training to fill in missing image regions. This paper argues that while context encoders show promise for inpainting, they struggle with reconstructing complex image structures. To address this, the authors propose replacing the pixel reconstruction and adversarial losses used for training with a perceptual loss based on deep features from a VGG network. This "structural loss" better captures semantic image properties and allows the network to reconstruct structures more effectively. The adversarial loss is only re-introduced later in training to improve texture realism. Experiments demonstrate the ability of this modified context encoder to plausibly complete missing regions in a variety of images, including urban scenes and images with complex structures. The completed images can be further refined with existing patch-based optimization techniques. Comparisons and a user study confirm improvements over the original context encoder approach.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes modifications to the context encoder neural network architecture for improved image inpainting. The context encoder is trained to fill in missing regions of an image by predicting the missing content based on the surrounding context. The authors argue that the original context encoder struggles to reconstruct complex structures even though it is able to generate semantically meaningful completions in some cases. 

To improve structure reconstruction, the authors replace the pixel reconstruction and adversarial losses used to train the original context encoder with a new "structural loss" based on deep features from a pre-trained VGG network. This perceptual loss allows the network to focus on reconstructing salient image structures while ignoring less important texture details. The adversarial loss is only re-introduced later in training to sharpen details. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model is better able to complete structures like lines and shapes compared to the original context encoder. A user study also shows people prefer the reconstructions of the proposed model. When combined with an optimization-based refinement step, the proposed context encoder achieves improved inpainting results on a variety of images.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes modifications to the context encoder (CE) architecture for image inpainting. The key contributions are:

1. Replacing the pixel reconstruction + adversarial loss used to train the original CE with a perceptual, feature-based reconstruction loss (called structural loss). This is shown to help the network better complete complex structures in the inpainted region. 

2. Using adversarial training in a second stage, after pre-training with just the structural loss. This helps add realism and texture details to the inpainted region.

3. Showing through experiments that the proposed CE with structural loss and late adversarial training outperforms the original CE on inpainting tasks, especially for complex structures. It also generalizes well to varied scenes without specialization.

4. Demonstrating that the optimized CE output can be further refined through existing patch-based optimization methods that use neural features, leading to improved final results.

In summary, the paper improves the inpainting ability of context encoders by using perceptual losses and careful adversarial training, while retaining the benefits of refinement through optimization.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of structural inpainting, which involves filling in missing or unwanted parts of an image in a visually plausible way, especially for complex structures. The key questions/aspects addressed are:

- How to improve the ability of convolutional neural networks called "context encoders" to complete complex structures for inpainting tasks. Context encoders had shown promise for inpainting but struggled with some structure completion.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes modifications to context encoders to improve their ability to complete complex structures for image inpainting. Context encoders are convolutional encoder-decoder networks trained to reconstruct missing image regions based on surrounding context. The authors argue that the original context encoder model struggles to reconstruct some simple structures and textures. They propose replacing the pixel-wise and adversarial losses with a perceptual, feature-based loss to focus on reconstructing meaningful image properties rather than exact pixels. This "structural loss" compares feature activations in a pretrained VGG network between the output and ground truth images. Adding a second phase of adversarial training further improves texture realism. Experiments demonstrate the proposed modifications allow the context encoder to better complete structures like lines and curves compared to the original model. The refined encoder can be paired with optimization-based neural patch synthesis for high-quality inpainting results. A user study confirms the proposed approach produces more plausible image completions than the original context encoder model.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for scene-agnostic visual inpainting, i.e. filling in missing regions of an image in a plausible way without relying on prior knowledge about the scene content. The authors build on the recent "context encoder" model of Pathak et al. which uses a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture trained on image completion tasks in a self-supervised manner. However, they identify some limitations of the original context encoder, particularly in its ability to reconstruct complex structures. 

To address this, the authors introduce a new "structural loss" that compares ground-truth and predicted image content in a deep perceptual feature space rather than just pixel space. This provides more flexibility during training while still focusing on meaningful image properties. The encoder-decoder is first trained with this structural loss alone, then fine-tuned with an adversarial loss to produce more realistic details and textures.

Experiments demonstrate improved performance over the original context encoder, especially for complex structures like those found in indoor/urban scenes. The new model also performs well even with very limited surrounding context. Qualitative and quantitative results on ImageNet and Paris StreetView datasets show the advantages over prior work. The inpainted outputs can be further refined with optimization-based neural patch synthesis methods.

Overall, the work shows how deep perceptual losses can enhance context encoders for the task of structural inpainting. It opens opportunities for building scene-agnostic systems that can plausibly complete a wider variety of images. Limitations remain for highly complex semantic inpainting.
