# [Topic-to-essay generation with knowledge-based content selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16248)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Topic-to-essay generation (TEG) aims to generate coherent paragraphs from a set of topic words, but has two main limitations:
    1) Existing methods fail to fully utilize the rich semantic knowledge in language models, resulting in low text quality.  
    2) Methods focus too much on labeled text, restricting diversity.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel content selection TEG generator using a pre-trained GENIUS language model and copy mechanism to improve text diversity while maintaining topic consistency.
    - Copy mechanism allows heightened attention to topic words during generation.
    - Novel content selection module selects relevant encoder/decoder info to generate, improving diversity.
    - Improved prefix tuning method adapts model to varying input complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a TEG model incorporating copy mechanism and content selection module to improve text diversity significantly.
- Introduce an improved prefix tuning method to train the model, enabling adaptation to different input complexities.  
- Release a new large-scale Chinese dataset NAES for TEG with multi-topic articles.
- Experiments show the model improves diversity by 35-59% over state-of-the-art while maintaining high topic consistency.

In summary, the key innovation is a TEG generator with a content selection module to improve semantic diversity by better utilizing knowledge from language models, trained with an enhanced prefix tuning approach. The model achieves much higher textual diversity than prior works on multiple datasets.
