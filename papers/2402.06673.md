Overview:
This paper provides a comprehensive review of Explainable AI (XAI), exploring its evolution, current state-of-the-art methods, challenges, and future directions towards developing human-like intelligence and brain-inspired AI systems. 

Problem Statement:
As AI systems become increasingly complex "black boxes", there is a critical need to make them more interpretable and transparent, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. However, achieving explainability faces multiple challenges regarding generative models, responsible AI practices, and ethical implications.

Methods & Contributions:
The paper systematically examines various XAI techniques spanning feature-based, pixel-based, concept model, surrogate model and human-centric methods. It highlights innovative approaches like SHAP, Grad-CAM++, CAVs, SLISE and human-prototype based systems that advance model interpretability. The analysis also covers usability assessments of counterfactual explanations using frameworks like Alien Zoo.  

Challenges: 
Key challenges identified include the inherent opacity of generative models like GANs, NeRF and LLMs, issues of bias and fairness in AI systems, and the subjectivity of human values posing hurdles for responsible and ethical AI development.

Advancements Towards Brain-Like AI:
The paper delves deeper into efforts to reverse-engineer human brain functionalities using neuroscience-inspired AI to achieve consciousness, emotional intelligence, and ultimately Human-Like Intelligence (HLI). It emphasizes emerging research directions in AI-neuroscience integration, brain decoding with AI, simulations of neural processes, and interdisciplinary explorations of cognition.

Conclusions:
In summary, the paper highlights XAI's indispensable role in demystifying AI and enhancing trustworthiness. As AI progresses towards Artificial General Intelligence, the convergence with neuroscience and cognitive sciences becomes imperative for developing transparent and human-interpretable systems that encapsulate multifaceted human cognition.
