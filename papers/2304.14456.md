# [Framing the News:From Human Perception to Large Language Model   Inferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14456)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:

RQ1: What are the main frames used in news headlines about the anti-vaccine movement, as reported in newspapers across 5 European countries? 

RQ2: Can prompt engineering be used for automatic classification of news headlines according to frames?

The authors state these research questions explicitly in the Introduction section:

"Our work aims to address this research gap by posing the following research questions:

RQ1: What are the main frames in the news headlines about the anti-vaccine movement, as reported in newspapers across 5 European countries?

RQ2: Can prompt engineering be used for classification of headlines according to frames?"

The first research question aims to understand what framing perspectives are used in news headlines about the anti-vaccine movement in major European newspapers. The second research question examines whether prompt engineering with large language models like GPT-3.5 can be used for automatic classification of news frames, as an alternative to fine-tuning approaches.

So in summary, the central research questions focus on identifying predominant news frames related to the anti-vaccine movement, and investigating prompt engineering methods for automatic classification of such frames.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors implement a process to manually annotate the main news frame in 1786 headlines about the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement from newspapers in 5 European countries. The predominant frames found are human interest and no frame, with human interest focusing on personal stories and viewpoints. 

2. The authors study the performance of GPT-3.5 on the task of automatically classifying news headline frames. They show that fine-tuning GPT-3.5 achieves 72% accuracy on a 6-class frame classification task, slightly outperforming BERT-based models. They also propose a new prompt engineering approach with GPT-3.5 that achieves 49% accuracy compared to human annotations. Further analysis reveals the subjectivity of the framing task, with human-machine agreement reaching 76% in a post-hoc experiment.

3. The paper discusses the economic and environmental costs and limitations of using large language models like GPT-3.5 for news analysis tasks, and argues for the need to assess use cases where these models can be potentially useful while acknowledging their current shortcomings.

In summary, the main contributions are the human annotation and analysis of news frames, the empirical study of GPT-3.5's performance on automatic frame classification compared to human perception, and the discussion of the costs, usefulness and limitations of large language models for journalistic tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops and evaluates methods using large language models like GPT-3.5 for automatic classification of news frames (how news is presented), focusing on articles about the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement in Europe; it finds that fine-tuning GPT-3.5 achieves 72% accuracy while a prompt engineering approach reaches 49% agreement with human annotators' labels, showing promise but also limitations of current AI approaches for this subjective journalistic task.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in news framing analysis:

- The paper follows a deductive approach for frame analysis by using a pre-defined set of generic frames rather than an inductive approach where frames emerge from the text. This is a common approach in computing research to allow comparison across topics and use of ML models. 

- The paper analyzes news framing in headlines rather than full articles. Some prior work has looked at either headlines or full articles, while others have compared framing at both levels. Analyzing headlines allows avoiding length limitations of ML models.

- For frame classification, the paper explores both fine-tuning a large language model (GPT-3.5) and prompt engineering with GPT-3.5. Prior computing research has focused more on fine-tuning BERT-based models. Using GPT-3.5 and prompt engineering are relatively novel approaches in this field.

- The paper emphasizes the subjectivity involved in human annotation of frames, and provides evidence that GPT-3.5 inferences often agree with multiple valid human perspectives. Accounting for subjectivity has been limited in prior automatic framing analysis.

- The paper focuses specifically on the under-studied topic of news coverage of the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement in Europe. Prior computing research has looked at framing in other controversial topics like climate change, immigration, etc.

Overall, this paper makes contributions around using large language models, prompt engineering, and accounting for subjectivity in an under-studied framing topic, building on prior approaches for deductive frame analysis and headline classification research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Studying framing at the full article level instead of just headlines. The authors suggest that analyzing full articles could shed light on whether subjectivity in framing is reduced with longer text, and whether models like GPT-3 perform better on full articles versus headlines for frame classification. They present some initial exploratory analysis but state that framing of full articles requires more in-depth investigation.

2. Exploring the possibility of multiple valid frames in a given text. The authors discuss how subjectivity makes choosing a single frame difficult even for human annotators. They suggest studying approaches that allow labeling and classifying multiple applicable frames instead of forcing a single label.

3. Analysis of framing in languages other than English. The authors note the environmental impact of large English language models like GPT-3. They suggest developing models for other languages to make framing analysis more equitable across different populations.

4. Reducing the economic and environmental costs of using large language models. The authors discuss the high computational expenses of models like GPT-3 and suggest investigating ways to improve framing analysis that are more cost and energy efficient.

In summary, the main future directions are: deeper study of full article framing, allowing multiple frames, expanding beyond English, and reducing costs of large models. The authors lay out an interesting research agenda for the framing analysis community.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the framing of news headlines about the COVID-19 anti-vaccine movement in newspapers from 5 European countries. The authors first manually annotated 1786 headlines to identify the predominant frames, finding that human interest and no clear frame were most common. They then investigated using the GPT-3.5 language model to automatically classify frames, comparing fine-tuning and prompt engineering approaches. Fine-tuning achieved 72% accuracy while prompt engineering only reached 49% agreement with human annotations. However, further analysis showed the model agreed with human judgement in 76% of cases, indicating subjectivity in the task. Overall, the work analyzed human perception of frames in anti-vaccine headlines and compared this to inferences from large language models, showing promise but also limitations in replicating human judgement.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents an analysis of news framing related to the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement, using articles from newspapers in 5 European countries. The first part of the paper focuses on human annotation of news headlines to identify the dominant frames used when reporting on this issue. The authors developed a protocol and codebook for annotators to label 1786 headlines into one of 6 frame categories: human interest, conflict, morality, attribution of responsibility, economic consequences, or no frame. The results showed that human interest and no frame were the most common, while morality and economic consequences were rare. 

The second part of the paper explored using large language models like GPT-3.5 for automatic classification of news frames. They compared fine-tuning GPT-3.5 to prompt engineering with GPT-3.5. Fine-tuning achieved 72% accuracy in classifying the 6 frame types, slightly better than BERT models. Prompt engineering had lower accuracy at 49%, but further analysis showed the model proposals aligned with human judgment in 76% of cases, indicating subjectivity in the framing task. Overall the work provides insights into news framing of a major societal issue and lays groundwork for future research on automating frame analysis.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a study on analyzing news frames related to the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement in Europe. The authors first created a dataset of 1786 news headlines from 19 newspapers across 5 European countries. Two researchers manually annotated the headlines to identify the predominant news frame according to a predefined set of 6 frames (human interest, conflict, morality, attribution of responsibility, economic consequences, and no frame). The inter-coder reliability between the annotators was 0.66 after a training process. With this annotated dataset, the authors then investigated two computational approaches for automatic classification of news frames on the headlines: fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (GPT-3.5) and prompt engineering with GPT-3.5. For fine-tuning, they used 5-fold cross validation and compared GPT-3.5 to BERT-based models. For prompt engineering, they designed prompts to input the frame definitions and a headline, and ask GPT-3.5 to output the most likely frame. They evaluated agreement of GPT-3.5 inferences to human annotations. The main method is thus a combined approach of human annotation of frames on a news headline dataset, followed by computational modeling for automatic classification.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem/question being addressed is: 

How to automatically identify news frames, which are the aspects of a news story that are emphasized or highlighted, in European newspaper articles about the Covid-19 anti-vaccine ("no-vax") movement. Specifically, the paper focuses on two main research questions:

1. What are the main news frames used in headlines about the no-vax movement across 5 European countries (France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, UK)?

2. Can natural language processing approaches like prompt engineering with large language models like GPT-3.5 be used to automatically classify news headlines into different frame categories?

The first question aims to understand what common frames are used to report on the no-vax movement in different European countries by manually annotating a corpus of 1786 headlines. The second question then investigates methods to automate this framing analysis using state-of-the-art NLP models. Overall, the paper is studying computational and machine learning approaches to analyze news framing on the topical issue of vaccine hesitancy.
