# [Optimal Rates of Kernel Ridge Regression under Source Condition in Large   Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01270)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies the generalization error of kernel ridge regression (KRR) in the high-dimensional setting where the sample size $n$ scales as $n \asymp d^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma>0$ with respect to the dimension $d$. 
- It considers a general source condition that the true regression function $f_{\rho}^{*}$ lies in the interpolation space $[\mathcal{H}]^{s}$ of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) $\mathcal{H}$ for some smoothness parameter $s>0$.
- The goal is to characterize the optimal convergence rates of the generalization error for KRR and study its minimax optimality and saturation effect in the high-dimensional setting.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper first establishes a general framework (Theorem 1) to characterize matching upper and lower bounds of the generalization error using key quantities depending on the RKHS, true function and regularization parameter.
- It then specializes the results to inner product kernels on the sphere and derives exact convergence rates of the generalization error under source condition $s>0$ when $n\asymp d^{\gamma}$ (Theorem 2 and 3). It also proves corresponding minimax lower bounds (Theorem 4).  

Main Contributions:
- Allows the dimension $d$ to grow with $n$ and establishes rates under a general source condition framework. Previous works mostly focus on the fixed $d$ setting.
- Proves exact convergence rates of generalization error for KRR in the high-dimensional setting for any $s>0$, while previous works assume $s=0$ or $s=1$.
- Shows minimax optimality of KRR for $0<s\leq 1$ and discovers a new saturation effect when $1<s\leq 2$ where KRR cannot achieve the minimax lower bound.
- Reveals that the convergence rate curves exhibit "periodic plateau behavior" and "multiple descent behavior" in the high-dimensional setting. Provides a unified viewpoint connecting previous results.

So in summary, the paper provides a thorough characterization of the generalization ability of KRR in the high-dimensional scaling regime under general smoothness assumptions, revealing intriguing phenomena compared to the fixed dimensional setting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper studies the exact convergence rates and minimax optimality of kernel ridge regression in the large-dimensional setting under general source condition, and shows the periodic plateau behavior of the rate curves for inner product kernels on the sphere.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It establishes a general framework (Theorem 1) to characterize the asymptotic upper and lower bounds of the generalization error of kernel ridge regression, which makes minimal assumptions and is applicable to both fixed-dimensional and large-dimensional settings. 

2) For inner product kernels on the sphere and large-dimensional scaling (n ~ d^γ), it derives exact convergence rates of the generalization error under general source condition s>0 (Theorems 2 and 3). The rate curves exhibit periodic plateau behavior and evolve in an intriguing way as s changes.

3) It proves the minimax optimality of kernel ridge regression when 0<s<=1. When s>1, it discovers a new version of the saturation effect where kernel ridge regression fails to achieve the minimax lower bound for certain ranges of γ, even with best regularization.

4) It provides a unified viewpoint to explain the periodic behavior observed in some recent works, and clarifies the relation between the square-integrable function setting (s=0) and the function in RKHS setting (s=1).

In summary, this paper significantly advances the theoretical understanding of kernel ridge regression in the large-dimensional setting under general smoothness assumptions. The analysis techniques developed could inspire future studies on the generalization of other kernel methods or neural networks.

The paper studies the generalization error and optimal convergence rates of kernel ridge regression in the setting where both sample size $n$ and dimension $d$ grow large at comparable rates. Key concepts like effective dimension, source condition, minimax optimality, and saturation effect are analyzed for this large-dimensional regime. Techniques from asymptotic analysis, spherical harmonics, and interpolation spaces of RKHS play an important role. The results demonstrate periodic plateau behavior and multiple descent phenomena for the excess risk as a function of the sample size. Implications for neural tangent kernels are also discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new general framework to characterize the asymptotic upper and lower bounds of the generalization error of kernel ridge regression. How does this framework differ from the traditional capacity-source condition framework used in prior work? What new flexibility or generality does it provide?

2. Theorem 1 provides matching upper and lower bounds on the generalization error under certain approximation conditions on key quantities involving the RKHS, true function, and regularization parameter. What is the intuition behind each of these approximation conditions? Are they reasonable and when might they be violated?  

3. For the application to inner product kernels on the sphere, what drives the evolution of the rate curves with respect to the source condition exponent s? Why do the curve shapes differ significantly between s<1 versus s≥1?

4. What is the root cause behind the periodic plateau behavior exhibited by the rate curves? How does the plateau length vary with the source condition and why? Could this provide guidance on required sample sizes?

5. The paper shows the minimax optimality of KRR for 0<s≤1 but discovers a new saturation effect for 1<s≤2 that violates minimax optimality. What is the implication of this early saturation effect and how might it impact algorithm design?

6. For inner product kernels on the sphere, can you derive matching convergence rate bounds for the neural tangent kernel based on its explicit eigenvalues/eigenfunctions? How do the NTK rate curves compare?

7. The proof techniques rely heavily on intricate calculations of key quantities involving eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, source condition etc. What are the most delicate or difficult steps? Are there any potential loose ends?

8. What polynomial eigenvalue decay conditions used in prior fixed-dimensional analyses are violated in the large-dimensional setting and why? How does the paper address this?

9. The paper claims the framework enables handling large-dimensional settings. What modifications would be needed to handle other domains beyond the sphere? What additional challenges might arise?

10. Could the approach be extended to analyze other kernel methods beyond ridge regression, such as kernel gradient descent, kernel SVM, kernel interpolation etc? What new proof ingredients would be required?
