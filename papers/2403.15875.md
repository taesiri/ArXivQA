# [LAMPER: LanguAge Model and Prompt EngineeRing for zero-shot time series   classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Time series (TS) tasks like classification require substantial domain expertise and bespoke model design, limiting performance and generalization. 
- Recent work has shown promise in using pre-trained language models (PLMs) and prompt engineering for TS tasks, but their effectiveness for zero-shot TS classification is unexplored.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the LAMPER framework to systematically evaluate PLMs and prompt engineering for zero-shot TS classification. 
- They design 3 prompt types: Simple Description, Detailed Description, and Feature prompts. The prompts are crafted to leverage PLMs' strengths in representing TS features.
- To handle PLMs' limited input length, TS are split into sub-sequences with corresponding sub-prompts. Sub-sequence embeddings are pooled to get full TS embedding.
- Two PLMs are tested: Longformer (4096 token limit) and BERT (512 token limit).

Experiments:
- 128 univariate TS datasets from UCR archive used. 
- Various prompt combinations fed into PLMs to extract embeddings, classified by SVM.
- Longformer outperforms BERT, indicating input length limits hurt feature representation.
- Prompts give marginal improvement over raw TS, suggesting difficulty for PLMs to capture nuances of TS data.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposes LAMPER framework to systematically test PLMs for zero-shot TS classification
- Provides insights into effects of different prompts and input length constraints
- Establishes strong baselines for future work on applying PLMs to TS feature representation

The summary covers the key points on the problem, proposed method, experiments, and contributions. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
