# [V2VSSC: A 3D Semantic Scene Completion Benchmark for Perception with   Vehicle to Vehicle Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to predict full 3D voxel details including occupancy and semantics from partial observations. It is critical for autonomous vehicles to understand 3D scenes, but SSC often suffers from occlusion and short-range perception due to sensor limitations. This poses safety risks for autonomous navigation. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a novel collaborative SSC framework leveraging vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. It allows autonomous vehicles to share sensing information from different viewpoints to jointly perform SSC and address occlusion challenges. The paper builds the first V2V SSC benchmark V2VSSC on the OPV2V dataset with 4 models and 6 semantic categories - road, cars, terrain, buildings, vegetation and poles.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces a new collaborative approach for SSC using V2V communication to provide multiple perspectives and bypass occlusions.

2) Establishes V2VSSC - the first V2V SSC benchmark with diverse models and semantic classes to set a standard for further research.

3) Demonstrates significant SSC improvements using V2V communication - 8.3% higher IoU metric and 6.0% higher mIoU metric. This validates the efficacy of the proposed collaborative approach to address real-world challenges in SSC.

In summary, the paper pioneers a collaborative V2V-based approach for SSC to overcome limitations of single vehicle perception. The V2VSSC benchmark and experiments showcase substantial gains, highlighting the potential of this technique to enable robust 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving.
