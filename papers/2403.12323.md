# [Enhanced Detection of Transdermal Alcohol Levels Using Hyperdimensional   Computing on Embedded Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12323)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health issues. Providing timely notifications of intoxication levels can promote responsible drinking habits.  
- Prior methods of measuring blood alcohol content (BAC) levels are invasive and require active user cooperation. 
- Previous studies have used smartphone accelerometer data and machine learning to estimate BAC levels, but these have lacked the accuracy and efficiency to enable practical mobile and wearable applications.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) for classifying heavy drinking episodes based on accelerometer data from smartphones. 
- HDC offers low latency, low power usage, and high parallelism, making it well-suited for IoT applications.
- The authors explore different HDC encodings to represent the time series and feature data as well as different HDC classification algorithms to find an optimal approach.

Key Contributions:
- Achieves 89% accuracy in classifying heavy drinking, a 12% improvement over prior state-of-the-art. 
- Shows that ordering data chronologically further improves accuracy by 7% with HDC leveraging temporal information.
- Ensemble HDC encoder using Generic and Density encodings performs the best.
- RefineHD HDC classification algorithm with iterative training provides top accuracy.
- Approach is efficient to enable real-time inference on smartphones and wearables for just-in-time interventions.
- Paves way for widely accessible and non-invasive solutions to promote responsible drinking habits.

In summary, the paper presents a highly accurate and efficient HDC-based approach to detect heavy drinking episodes in real-time using smartphone data, significantly advancing state-of-the-art to enable practical interventions that can improve public health.
