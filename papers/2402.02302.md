# [Predicting positive transfer for improved low-resource speech   recognition using acoustic pseudo-tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages is challenging when little transcribed speech data is available. 
- While massively multilingual speech models can be fine-tuned, performance is often poorer for under-represented languages.  
- Continued pre-training helps adapt models to the target language, but requires 70-200 hours of speech. Many languages have even less untranscribed data available.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate if supplementing 10 hours of target language (e.g. Punjabi) with 60 hours of speech from a similar "donor" language during continued pre-training can improve ASR performance. 
- Propose a new acoustic similarity measure called Acoustic Token Distribution Similarity (ATDS) to select the best donor language. It is based on distributional similarity of recurring acoustic-phonetic sequences induced from the raw speech signals.

Key Findings:
- Adding data from closely related donor languages (Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati) helps ASR in Punjabi, but unrelated languages (Tamil, Malayalam) do not. Hindi helped the most, closing the gap to using 70 hours of Punjabi.  
- ATDS accurately predicts donor language benefits across diverse target languages (Punjabi, Galician, Iban, Setswana). It outperforms similarity measures based on typological databases or other speech models.
- ATDS leverages native inductive biases of the model itself, avoiding issues with unavailable/inaccurate metadata for under-described languages.

Main Contributions:  
- Systematic study of pairwise language transfer effects on target language ASR performance
- Development and validation of ATDS for selecting optimal donor languages to improve ASR in low-resource target languages
