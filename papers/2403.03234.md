# [Caduceus: Bi-Directional Equivariant Long-Range DNA Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modeling genomic sequences presents several key challenges compared to natural language or proteins, including the need to handle:
1) Bi-directional context, as phenotypes depend on base pairs both upstream and downstream.  
2) Reverse complementarity of the two DNA strands, which contain equivalent information. Accounting for this can improve performance.
3) Long-range interactions between nucleic acids even millions of base pairs away that impact phenotypes like gene expression.

Existing models either do not account for these aspects or do not scale to long contexts due to relying on attention.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose new model components motivated by these challenges:

1) BiMamba - Extends the efficient long-range Mamba block to bi-directional modeling by having shared parameters process the sequence and its reverse.

2) MambaDNA - Further adds reverse complement (RC) equivariance to BiMamba by applying it to the sequence and its RC with tied parameters.

They use MambaDNA to build Caduceus, the first family of bi-directional, long-range, RC equivariant language models for DNA sequences. 

Two Caduceus versions are introduced:
- Caduceus-PS: RC equivariant during pre-training and made invariant for tasks.
- Caduceus-Ph: Uses RC data augmentation during pre-training and post-hoc RC sequence ensembling during tasks.

Contributions:
1) BiMamba - Efficient bi-directional extension of Mamba
2) MambaDNA - Adds RC equivariance to BiMamba
3) Caduceus - First RC equivariant bi-directional DNA language model
4) Demonstrates Caduceus exceeds models 10x larger on long-range genomics tasks.
