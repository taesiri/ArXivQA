# [Exploiting CLIP for Zero-shot HOI Detection Requires Knowledge   Distillation at Multiple Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05069)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new challenging task called zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection, where no HOI annotations are provided during training. To tackle this, the authors design a multi-branch neural network incorporating CLIP components to extract multi-level HOI representations. Specifically, there is a global branch performing image-level HOI recognition, a union branch encoding contextual cues from human-object pairs, and a human-object branch focusing on instance-specific relations. To generate supervision signals, CLIP HOI scores are computed on both global images and local union regions. The global scores guide the learning of global and human-object branches, while union scores supervise the union branch. Experiments show this multi-level knowledge distillation strategy achieves 17.12 mAP on HICO-DET dataset, which is comparable to some fully-supervised methods. The approach also generalizes well to rare HOI categories and unseen concepts during training. Overall, it demonstrates the feasibility of zero-shot HOI detection by effectively transferring knowledge from the pre-trained CLIP model. Some limitations include incorrectly associating distant human-object pairs and struggling with heavily occluded objects. Future work may focus on detecting ambiguous relationships in a zero-shot setup or adapting different CLIP model designs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-level knowledge distillation strategy from CLIP to pioneer the novel task of zero-shot HOI detection, where a multi-branch network leverages CLIP components for HOI representation learning and CLIP scores on global images and local regions provide supervision signals, achieving strong performance comparable to some fully-supervised methods without using any HOI annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It pioneers the challenging task of zero-shot HOI detection, a new learning setup where no HOI annotations are used during training. This is a significant leap forward in the field of HOI detection.

2. It proposes a multi-level knowledge distillation strategy from CLIP for this task, where it seamlessly incorporates CLIP into the model design for detecting HOIs on different scales, and captures both global and local contexts to provide rich supervision for model training. 

3. It conducts extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CLIP integration strategies. The results demonstrate strong performance on par with some fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods on HICO-DET benchmarks.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and tackling the novel problem of zero-shot HOI detection using a multi-level knowledge distillation approach that leverages CLIP.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a multi-branch network architecture that incorporates global, union, and human-object branches. What is the motivation behind using a multi-branch design compared to a single-branch network? How do the different branches capture distinct levels of contextual information?

2) The method utilizes CLIP to generate supervision signals from both global images and local union regions. Why are both global and local supervisions necessary? What complementary information does each provide? How sensitive is performance to the relative weight given to global vs local supervisions?

3) Knowledge distillation is performed from the pre-trained CLIP model to the proposed network. What specific knowledge is being distilled from CLIP? Why is distillation preferred over directly using CLIP for inference? How does the distillation loss align the predictions of the model with those of CLIP?

4) The paper finds that a late fusion strategy for incorporating union branch information works better than early fusion. What causes early fusion to underperform? Why does late fusion of scores rather than features work better?

5) How does the relative performance on rare vs non-rare classes compare between the proposed model and fully/weakly supervised methods? What explains the differences seen?

6) Qualitative results show the model succeeds on small, occluded or unseen objects. What capabilities enable these strong results? Are there failure cases where small or obscured objects still challenge the model?

7) The CLIP version used obtains 35.5 mAP on image-level HOI recognition. How does this compare with state-of-the-art for this task? Could a better CLIP model further improve results? What performance limitations arise from CLIP vs the proposed model?

8) The method trains from scratch while freezing CLIP weights. What would be the challenges and potential benefits of fine-tuning the CLIP model jointly? Would this require changes to the distillation losses used?

9) The paper focuses on HICO-DET dataset and 600 HOI categories. Could the approach be applied to other HOI datasets like V-COCO? Would the zero-shot assumption remain realistic if the output space grows 10x larger?

10) The paper states zero-shot HOI detection is far from satisfactory. What further capabilities would be required to make this setup more usable in practice? What future work directions seem most promising to close this gap?
