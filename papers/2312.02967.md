# [AmbiGen: Generating Ambigrams from Pre-trained Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02967)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for generating ambigrams, which are words that can be read from different orientations, by leveraging recent advances in text-to-image foundation models. The key idea is to formulate the ambigram design process as an optimization problem, where the objective function aims to maintain legibility of the letters from two viewing orientations. Specifically, the loss function distills DeepFloyd IF, a large-scale vision and language diffusion model, to update the control points of the BÃ©zier curves representing each glyph. It incorporates both letter-level and word-level losses to ensure quality. The method is evaluated both quantitatively using an OCR model and qualitatively via a user study. Results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches, including both manually designed and learning-based baselines. The proposed approach achieves over 11\% higher word accuracy and at least a 41.9\% reduction in edit distance. The flexibility of the method is further showcased on unequal length ambigrams. Overall, this paper presents a novel way to leverage recent advancements in foundation models to automate the creative process of designing ambigrams.
