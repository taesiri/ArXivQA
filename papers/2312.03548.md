# [Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network for ORSI Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03548)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network (TSCNet) for salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD). TSCNet explores the collaboration of texture and semantic features to accurately locate salient objects and sharpen their detail. It is based on an encoder-decoder structure with a novel Texture-Semantic Collaboration Module (TSCM) that modulates encoder features using the lowest-level texture features and highest-level semantic features. Specifically, the Position Anchoring Unit enhances position highlighting of salient regions using semantic features. The Texture Rendering Unit then restores object detail using texture features. Meanwhile, the Region Interaction Unit reconstructs textures by establishing connections between regions. By perfectly combining texture and semantic cues, TSCNet can handle various challenging ORSI scenes with multiple objects, small objects, and irregular shapes. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate TSCNet's state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component. Overall, TSCNet is a competitive ORSI-SOD method owing to the effective texture-semantic collaboration.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. It explores the collaboration of texture cues and semantic cues for salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs), and proposes a novel Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network (TSCNet) which takes into account both position highlighting and detail rendering of salient objects. 

2. It proposes a Texture-Semantic Collaboration Module (TSCM) to coordinate the lowest-level texture features and the highest-level semantic features to perform valuable modulation and interaction on other levels of features, enhancing the expression of salient regions.

3. It evaluates the proposed TSCNet on three public ORSI-SOD datasets and shows through comprehensive experiments that TSCNet achieves competitive performance compared to 14 state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of TSCNet which explores the collaboration of texture and semantic cues via the proposed TSCM, achieving strong performance for ORSI-SOD.
