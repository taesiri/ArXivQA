## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network (TSCNet) for salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD). TSCNet explores the collaboration of texture and semantic features to accurately locate salient objects and sharpen their detail. It is based on an encoder-decoder structure with a novel Texture-Semantic Collaboration Module (TSCM) that modulates encoder features using the lowest-level texture features and highest-level semantic features. Specifically, the Position Anchoring Unit enhances position highlighting of salient regions using semantic features. The Texture Rendering Unit then restores object detail using texture features. Meanwhile, the Region Interaction Unit reconstructs textures by establishing connections between regions. By perfectly combining texture and semantic cues, TSCNet can handle various challenging ORSI scenes with multiple objects, small objects, and irregular shapes. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate TSCNet's state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component. Overall, TSCNet is a competitive ORSI-SOD method owing to the effective texture-semantic collaboration.
