# [Scaling up Dynamic Edge Partition Models via Stochastic Gradient MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The edge partition model (EPM) is an effective generative model for extracting overlapping community structures from static graph data. However, inference in EPM relies on slow Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that prevent it from scaling to massive networks.
- There is a need to develop scalable inference algorithms for EPM and its extensions to model the increasing amount of dynamic graph-structured data generated in social networks, recommender systems etc.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel generative model called the Dirichlet Dynamic Edge Partition Model (D2EPM) that extends EPM to capture the smooth evolution of vertices' memberships over time using a Dirichlet Markov chain construction.

- The model uses a hierarchical beta-gamma prior to automatically infer the appropriate number of communities and prevent overfitting. 

- A Gibbs sampling algorithm is presented using negative-binomial data augmentation for batch inference.

- For scalable inference, the paper develops a stochastic gradient MCMC algorithm leveraging the unique Dirichlet Markov chain construction. Two parameterizations are used - expanded mean and reduced mean tricks - to update the membership vectors.

Main Contributions:
- Novel dynamic extension of edge partition model using Dirichlet Markov chain to capture temporal smoothness of vertices' memberships.

- Gibbs sampling for batch inference using data augmentation techniques. Enables linear scaling w.r.t. number of edges.

- First scalable stochastic gradient MCMC algorithm for dynamic edge partition model utilizing the Dirichlet Markov chain construction.

- Demonstrated improved accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on several real-world dynamic graph datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes a Bayesian generative model for dynamic graphs that admits both batch and stochastic gradient inference, and shows improved performance over existing methods. The scalable SG-MCMC inference can handle large temporal networks.
