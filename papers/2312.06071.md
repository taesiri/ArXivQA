# [Probabilistic Precipitation Downscaling with Optical Flow-Guided   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06071)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Optical Flow Diffusion (OF-Diff), a novel generative model for the super-resolution of precipitation climate data that leverages ideas from video processing. The key insight is to incorporate temporal information to generate high-resolution precipitation frames from low-resolution inputs. This is achieved via two main components: first, a learned optical flow warp to account for motion between frames; and second, a conditional diffusion model that adds realistic high-frequency residuals. Experiments on a large-scale climate simulation dataset demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines like SwinIR and RVRT in terms of distributional metrics better suited for climate modeling. Additional analyses also highlight OF-Diff's improved modeling of extreme events and time-averaged spatial patterns. By adapting video-inspired techniques to this domain, the paper sets a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling that could enable more efficient high-resolution climate simulations.
