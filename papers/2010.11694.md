# [Unsupervised Representation Learning by InvariancePropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to learn useful visual representations from unlabeled images through propagating invariance at the category level. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning method called "Invariance Propagation" (InvP) that aims to learn representations invariant to intra-class variations across different instances of the same category. The key ideas and hypotheses are:- Semantically similar images reside in connected high-density regions in the representation space. By discovering neighbors and propagating local invariance along the nearest neighbor graph, semantically consistent positive samples can be obtained.- Learning representations invariant to the diverse positive samples leads to invariance at the category level, as opposed to only instance-level invariance.- A hard sampling strategy that focuses on hard positives can provide more intra-class variations and help capture abstract invariance more effectively.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by propagating invariance from the local neighborhood to broader positive samples across instances, category-level invariant representations can be learned from unlabeled images in an unsupervised manner. The proposed InvP method is designed to test this hypothesis.
