# [Unsupervised Representation Learning by InvariancePropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to learn useful visual representations from unlabeled images through propagating invariance at the category level. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning method called "Invariance Propagation" (InvP) that aims to learn representations invariant to intra-class variations across different instances of the same category. The key ideas and hypotheses are:- Semantically similar images reside in connected high-density regions in the representation space. By discovering neighbors and propagating local invariance along the nearest neighbor graph, semantically consistent positive samples can be obtained.- Learning representations invariant to the diverse positive samples leads to invariance at the category level, as opposed to only instance-level invariance.- A hard sampling strategy that focuses on hard positives can provide more intra-class variations and help capture abstract invariance more effectively.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by propagating invariance from the local neighborhood to broader positive samples across instances, category-level invariant representations can be learned from unlabeled images in an unsupervised manner. The proposed InvP method is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:- It proposes Invariance Propagation, a novel unsupervised learning method that exploits relations between different instances to learn representations invariant to category-level variations. - It introduces a positive sample discovery algorithm that recursively propagates local invariance through a kNN graph to find semantically consistent samples residing in high-density regions.- It demonstrates a hard sampling strategy to concentrate on maximizing agreement between the anchor and its hard positive samples, providing more intra-class variations.- It achieves state-of-the-art results on extensive downstream tasks, including ImageNet classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and object detection.- It provides both quantitative results and qualitative analysis like similarity distribution and neighborhood visualization to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.In summary, the key contribution is the proposed Invariance Propagation method that can effectively learn semantic representations from unlabeled data by discovering positive samples exhibiting intra-class variations and adopting a hard sampling strategy. Both algorithm design and comprehensive empirical results validate its superiority over previous methods.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on unsupervised representation learning:- It proposes a novel method called Invariance Propagation (InvP) that focuses on learning representations invariant to category-level variations, as opposed to just instance-level variations. This sets it apart from many prior contrastive learning methods.- InvP recursively discovers semantically consistent samples residing in the same high-density regions of the representation space. This allows it to model relations between different instances to capture intra-class invariance. - It demonstrates a hard sampling strategy to concentrate on maximizing agreement between an anchor and its hard positive samples. This provides more intra-class variation to help learn more abstract invariance.- Experiments show InvP achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet, Places205, and VOC2007 linear classification benchmarks. It also achieves strong performance on semi-supervised learning on ImageNet and transfer learning.- Compared to methods like SimCLR that require large batches, InvP is more efficient and can be trained on a single GPU with a standard batch size.In summary, this paper pushes unsupervised representation learning forward by focusing on category-level invariance, using a novel technique to discover positive samples, and demonstrating leading performance on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest modeling inter-instance relations is an effective approach in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other ways to model the relations between different instances besides using a kNN graph, to help capture semantic consistency and invariance. The authors mention graph neural networks as one potential direction.- Investigating different hard sampling strategies beyond using the lowest similarity samples, to provide meaningful and diverse augmentations. The authors suggest curriculum-based strategies as one idea.- Evaluating the approach on larger-scale datasets beyond ImageNet, to push the limits of what can be learned without labels.- Combining the idea of propagating invariance with other recent advances like momentum encoders or large batch sizes, to further improve results.- Applying the method to more downstream tasks like self-supervised pretraining for NLP models, to demonstrate wide applicability.- Analyzing the theoretical connections between invariant feature learning and semi-supervised learning principles like smoothness and consistency.- Developing adaptations tailored for video data, to take advantage of the additional temporal consistency constraints available.Overall, the core ideas of modeling inter-instance relationships and hard sampling strategies seem very general and could likely be extended in many creative ways. Moving from instance-level to more holistic category-level invariance is an intriguing concept worthy of further exploration across modalities and tasks.
