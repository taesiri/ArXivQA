# Answering Questions by Meta-Reasoning over Multiple Chains of Thought

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can large language models be improved at multi-hop question answering through reasoning over multiple chains of thought? More specifically, the paper introduces a new method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) that prompts a large language model to meta-reason across multiple reasoning chains and produce a final answer along with an explanation. The key ideas seem to be:- Using multiple reasoning chains not for their predictions but as a means to collect relevant evidence from different strategies/paths. - Feeding the multiple chains as context to a separate "meta-reasoner" language model to produce the final answer and explanation.- This allows combining facts from different chains and focusing on the most relevant evidence, aiming to improve accuracy and interpretability compared to prior approaches like self-consistency.The paper evaluates MCR on a range of multi-hop QA datasets, analyzing its performance compared to baselines and the quality of its generated explanations. The central hypothesis appears to be that meta-reasoning over multiple chains of thought in this way can enhance multi-hop question answering for large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Introducing a new method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) for multi-hop question answering. MCR prompts a large language model to meta-reason across multiple reasoning chains to produce a final answer and explanation. - MCR uses multiple reasoning chains not for their predictions like prior work, but as a means to collect relevant evidence facts from across chains. The facts are combined into a context that is fed to the meta-reasoner model.- The meta-reasoner model is separate from the decomposition model that generates the reasoning chains. It is prompted to read the context of facts and generate an answer + explanation in a chain-of-thought format.- Evaluating MCR on 7 multi-hop QA datasets with both implicit and explicit reasoning, showing it outperforms prior methods like self-consistency.- Analyzing the benefits of MCR, including measuring explanation quality, faithfulness, and cases where it combines facts across reasoning chains.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing this MCR approach for meta-reasoning over multiple chains of thought to get better performance and more interpretable explanations compared to prior work. The empirical results and analysis help validate the utility of MCR.
