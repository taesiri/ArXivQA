# [Answering Questions by Meta-Reasoning over Multiple Chains of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13007)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can large language models be improved at multi-hop question answering through reasoning over multiple chains of thought? More specifically, the paper introduces a new method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) that prompts a large language model to meta-reason across multiple reasoning chains and produce a final answer along with an explanation. The key ideas seem to be:- Using multiple reasoning chains not for their predictions but as a means to collect relevant evidence from different strategies/paths. - Feeding the multiple chains as context to a separate "meta-reasoner" language model to produce the final answer and explanation.- This allows combining facts from different chains and focusing on the most relevant evidence, aiming to improve accuracy and interpretability compared to prior approaches like self-consistency.The paper evaluates MCR on a range of multi-hop QA datasets, analyzing its performance compared to baselines and the quality of its generated explanations. The central hypothesis appears to be that meta-reasoning over multiple chains of thought in this way can enhance multi-hop question answering for large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Introducing a new method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) for multi-hop question answering. MCR prompts a large language model to meta-reason across multiple reasoning chains to produce a final answer and explanation. - MCR uses multiple reasoning chains not for their predictions like prior work, but as a means to collect relevant evidence facts from across chains. The facts are combined into a context that is fed to the meta-reasoner model.- The meta-reasoner model is separate from the decomposition model that generates the reasoning chains. It is prompted to read the context of facts and generate an answer + explanation in a chain-of-thought format.- Evaluating MCR on 7 multi-hop QA datasets with both implicit and explicit reasoning, showing it outperforms prior methods like self-consistency.- Analyzing the benefits of MCR, including measuring explanation quality, faithfulness, and cases where it combines facts across reasoning chains.So in summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing this MCR approach for meta-reasoning over multiple chains of thought to get better performance and more interpretable explanations compared to prior work. The empirical results and analysis help validate the utility of MCR.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR), a method for multi-hop question answering where a language model is prompted to meta-reason across multiple reasoning chains and produce a final answer with an explanation, rather than just aggregating answers like in prior work.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis comparing this paper to related work:- This paper introduces a new method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) for multi-hop question answering. It is similar to prior work like Self-Consistency (SC) in that it uses chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit reasoning from large language models (LLMs), and incorporates retrieval to reduce hallucination. - However, MCR differs from SC in how it aggregates information from multiple reasoning chains. Rather than just taking a majority vote on the predicted answers like SC, MCR uses a separate LLM module to jointly reason over the full chain contents and generate the final answer.- This allows MCR to combine facts across chains and select the most relevant information, leading to higher accuracy than SC in experiments. MCR also produces more interpretable outputs by generating explanations for its answers.- Compared to prior CoT methods like IR-CoT and Self-Ask, MCR similarly interleaves retrieval when generating reasoning chains. However, again it differs in its entailment step over multiple chains rather than just using the top chain.- Overall, MCR demonstrates a novel way to perform meta-reasoning over multiple CoTs that outperforms voting-based aggregation approaches like SC. The analysis shows the benefits of leveraging full chain contents rather than just predicted answers. This work advances multi-hop QA through its modeling of inter-chain reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more sophisticated methods for aggregating information across multiple reasoning chains. The paper introduces a prompted language model for meta-reasoning over chains, but they suggest exploring other aggregation methods as well.- Improving the contextual relevance and accuracy of the retrieved evidence sentences. The quality of evidence sentences impacts the reasoning process, so enhancing retrieval is an important direction.- Experimenting with different meta-reasoner architectures beyond standard language models. For example, exploring whether a model specifically trained for multi-chain reasoning could improve performance. - Applying the approach to additional complex reasoning tasks beyond question answering, such as abstractive summarization or dialogue.- Evaluating how well the approach generalizes when using a broader set of knowledge sources beyond Wikipedia for evidence retrieval.- Further analysis of the reasoning process, such as visualizing attention over facts across chains, to better understand the model's reasoning.- Implementing the system with more lightweight and scalable models to increase accessibility and applicability.So in summary, the main future directions are developing better aggregation methods, improving evidence retrieval, exploring specialized model architectures, applying the approach to new tasks, using more knowledge sources, gaining insight through analysis, and enabling scalability. The paper provides a good foundation and proposes intriguing research to build upon for multi-chain reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a new method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) for multi-hop question answering. MCR prompts a large language model to meta-reason across multiple reasoning chains sampled from a decomposition model, rather than simply aggregating their answers as in prior work like self-consistency. Specifically, the intermediate steps from multiple reasoning chains are concatenated into a unified context that is fed along with the original question into an entailment model. This entailment model is tasked with reading over the chains of reasoning and extracting relevant facts into a coherent explanation, before generating the final predicted answer. MCR is evaluated on 7 multi-hop QA datasets covering different reasoning skills, and is shown to consistently outperform baselines including self-consistency by 1.4-5.7%, while using the same sampled chains. Further analysis reveals MCR's ability to combine facts across chains and generate high quality explanations (82% rated as highly relevant) that allow verifying its answers. The findings demonstrate the potential of meta-reasoning over multiple chains compared to solely relying on aggregated answers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) for multi-hop question answering. MCR utilizes large language models and prompts them to meta-reason over multiple chains of thought, rather than simply aggregating their answers as in prior work like self-consistency. MCR has three main components. First, a decomposition model and retriever generate multiple reasoning chains, comprised of intermediate questions, retrieved evidence sentences, and answers. These chains are concatenated into a multi-chain context which is input to the second component, a meta-reasoning module. This prompted LM is designed to read the context, select relevant facts, and produce a final answer along with an explanation. Experiments on 7 multi-hop QA datasets show MCR outperforms strong baselines. Further analysis indicates MCR explanations exhibit high quality and that the approach benefits from combining facts across reasoning chains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:The paper introduces a method called Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) for multi-hop question answering. MCR uses a large language model that is prompted with examples to meta-reason over multiple chains of thought generated for a question, rather than simply aggregating their answers as in prior work like self-consistency. Specifically, multiple reasoning chains are first generated by interleaving a decomposition model that breaks down the question into steps, with a retriever that finds relevant evidence sentences for each step. These chains are concatenated into a multi-chain context which is input to the meta-reasoner language model, along with the original question. The model is prompted in a chain-of-thought format to read the context, select the most relevant facts, and produce a final answer with an explanation. By reasoning over multiple chains, MCR can combine facts and override incorrect majority votes. Experiments on 7 multi-hop QA datasets show MCR outperforms baselines like self-consistency, and analysis reveals it generates high quality explanations.
