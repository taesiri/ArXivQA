# [Compatibility of Fundamental Matrices for Complete Viewing Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:What are the necessary and sufficient compatibility conditions for a complete set of fundamental matrices to correspond to an actual set of camera matrices?More specifically, the paper focuses on studying compatibility conditions in the case of complete viewing graphs, where the fundamental matrix is known for each pair of cameras. The key contributions and findings include:- Showing that previous eigenvalue conditions on the stacked "n-view" fundamental matrix are redundant, and can be dropped from the compatibility criteria.- Providing explicit polynomial equations describing compatibility conditions in terms of the fundamental matrices and their epipoles, for the cases of 3 and 4 cameras.- Demonstrating that for 4 cameras, compatibility is generically determined by triple-wise conditions plus one additional 4-tuple condition.- Proving that for any number of cameras, if each subset of 4 cameras satisfies the quadruply compatibility conditions, then the whole set is compatible.So in summary, the paper aims to characterize the algebraic variety of compatible fundamental matrices in the complete graph case, in order to better understand when a reconstruction of cameras is possible. The key contribution is finding simpler algebraic descriptions of the compatibility conditions.
