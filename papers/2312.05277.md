# [3D Copy-Paste: Physically Plausible Object Insertion for Monocular 3D   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05277)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Monocular 3D object detection methods suffer from limited diversity and quantity of objects in existing real datasets. Data augmentation techniques have been widely used in 2D detection/segmentation tasks but it is non-trivial to extend them to 3D scenes due to physical constraints. The key challenges are:
(1) Collision and Occlusion Handling 
(2) Illumination and Shading
(3) Geometric Consistency

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "3D Copy-Paste", a novel physically plausible indoor 3D object insertion approach to augment existing indoor scene datasets with large-scale annotated 3D objects. The key idea is to copy 3D objects from external datasets and paste them into real indoor scenes in a physically plausible manner. 

The proposed pipeline has 3 main steps:
(1) Identify suitable planes in the scene for insertion and estimate plausible physical parameters like position, size and pose to avoid collisions
(2) Estimate spatially-varying illumination of the scene
(3) Render inserted object with proper lighting and shadows based on the estimated illumination to blend it seamlessly 

Main Contributions:
(1) Introduce "3D Copy-Paste", a physically plausible indoor 3D object insertion technique to automatically generate large-scale annotated 3D objects
(2) Demonstrate that training monocular 3D detection on dataset augmented by 3D Copy-Paste leads to state-of-the-art performance, suggesting it is an effective data augmentation technique
(3) Systematically evaluate the influence of inserted objects' physical properties like position and illumination on downstream detection performance, providing insights into their roles.

In summary, the paper addresses the problem of scarce annotated 3D data for monocular detection by proposing a novel physically plausible 3D object insertion approach. It makes notable contributions in using synthetic data augmentation to advance state-of-the-art in monocular 3D detection.
