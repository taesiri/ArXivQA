# [Scalable Multi-view Clustering via Explicit Kernel Features Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multi-view subspace clustering is an important technique for clustering data with multiple representations. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large datasets with millions of points, limiting their applicability. 

Solution:
This paper proposes a novel scalable framework for multi-view subspace clustering that leverages explicit kernel feature maps. Specifically:

1. It introduces a method to integrate multiple views of the data subspace structure into a unified consensus subspace structure graph. This captures complementary information across views.

2. It proposes an efficient optimization strategy that scales linearly with the number of data points by using properties of kernel feature maps. This reduces computational burden while maintaining clustering performance.

3. It introduces a weighting scheme to assign different importance levels to each view based on its clustering suitability.


Main Contributions:

1. A scalable multi-view subspace clustering framework that can handle datasets with millions of points efficiently using standard machines.

2. State-of-the-art performance, statistically significant improvements, and orders of magnitude speedups over existing methods on multiple real-world benchmark datasets.

3. Thorough experiments and statistical testing to validate the proposed methods, ensuring reproducibility.

In summary, this paper introduces an efficient and scalable framework for multi-view subspace clustering that outperforms existing methods. By handling large-scale datasets effectively, it helps unlock the potential of multi-view learning for real-world applications.
