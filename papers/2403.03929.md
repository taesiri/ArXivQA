# [Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting using Transformer-based Generative   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Extreme precipitation events are increasing in frequency due to climate change, causing major societal and infrastructure impacts. Accurately forecasting localized short-term shifts in rainfall is critical for disaster preparedness and response, but current precipitation nowcasting models struggle to reliably predict extreme rainfall events.

Proposed Solution:  
This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based generative model called NowcastingGPT with a novel Extreme Value Loss (EVL) regularizer for improved precipitation nowcasting, especially for extreme events. Key aspects include:

- Frames the precipitation nowcasting problem as video prediction, using a VideoGPT architecture with a VQ-VAE encoder/decoder and Autoregressive Transformer to model spatio-temporal dynamics.

- Introduces a new approach to compute EVL regularization without assuming fixed extreme representations, overcoming limitations of previous methods. Uses a binary classifier to dynamically predict extreme labels and weight the Transformer loss.

- Leverages a comprehensive radar imagery dataset from Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) containing extreme precipitation events.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes NowcastingGPT-EVL, combining VideoGPT architecture and custom EVL regularization for enhanced nowcasting of extreme precipitation events.

- Presents a novel EVL computation method that does not rely on predefined extreme representations, allowing better adaptation to data.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art quantitative performance of NowcastingGPT-EVL on real-world extreme weather dataset, especially on detecting and generating extreme rainfall events.

- Provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses highlighting accuracy and reliability improvements compared to previous benchmarks like Nuwä-EVL and PySTEPS.

Overall, the paper makes important advances in precipitation nowcasting using Transformer models, with a focus on better predicting potentially disastrous extreme rainfall events through tailored model architecture and losses. The proposed NowcastingGPT-EVL convincingly outperforms prior methods.
