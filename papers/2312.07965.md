# [Pneumonia Detection on chest X-ray images Using Ensemble of Deep   Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07965)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an ensemble learning method called EL for automated pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The EL method combines three top-performing CNN models - DenseNet169, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformer (VIT) - which are pre-trained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned on the chest X-ray dataset. Features extracted from the three models are concatenated and fed into additional layers consisting of batch normalization, dense, and dropout layers before the final classification output. Compared to the individual CNN models, the proposed EL method achieves better performance with 93.91% accuracy and 93.88% F1-score on the test set. The confusion matrices demonstrate that EL has improved predictive capabilities over the individual models, especially for correctly identifying pneumonia cases. The authors conclude that integrating features from multiple pre-trained CNNs via an ensemble approach enhances pneumonia classification performance on chest X-rays. Limitations are needing to optimize hyperparameters for transfer learning and high variance. Future work is to develop a weighted ensemble method based on each model's accuracy.
