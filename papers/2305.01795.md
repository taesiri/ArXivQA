# Multimodal Procedural Planning via Dual Text-Image Prompting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop models that can generate coherent and useful multimodal (text and image) procedural plans towards achieving a high-level goal?The key hypothesis seems to be:By leveraging the reasoning abilities of large language models and the image generation capabilities of diffusion models through a dual prompting approach, we can generate multimodal plans that provide informative, temporally coherent, and accurate guidance for completing tasks.Specifically, the dual prompting framework called Text-Image Prompting (TIP) uses a Text-to-Image Bridge and Image-to-Text Bridge to ground the text plans in the visual context and vice versa. This allows the model to generate plans that are well-aligned across modalities.The paper aims to demonstrate that this dual prompting approach enables zero-shot multimodal planning that is superior to unimodal or separately generated multimodal plans in terms of informativeness, coherence, and accuracy. The hypothesis is evaluated on two new datasets for this task.In summary, the key question is how to elicit strong multimodal planning abilities by combining reasoning from language models and image generation, which is addressed through the proposed TIP framework and evaluated on new multimodal planning datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing the multimodal procedural planning (MPP) task, where models are given a high-level goal and generate paired sequences of text and image steps to provide guidance for completing the goal. The key challenges are ensuring informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy across modalities.2. Proposing Text-Image Prompting (TIP), a dual-modality prompting method that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion text-to-image models. TIP uses two "bridges":- Text-to-Image Bridge: Uses LLMs to generate explicit scene descriptions that assist the text-to-image model in generating informative, grounded image plans. - Image-to-Text Bridge: Verbalizes the image plans using captions and injects them back into the LLM prompt to improve text plan informativeness and grounding.3. Collecting two new datasets, WikiPlan and RecipePlan, as testbeds for evaluating multimodal procedural planning.4. Demonstrating through human and automatic evaluations that TIP substantially improves over unimodal and basic multimodal baselines on informativeness, coherence, and accuracy for the MPP task on the collected datasets.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the multimodal procedural planning task and the dual text-image prompting method TIP, along with collecting relevant datasets and showing strong performance improvements over baselines. The dual grounding of text and images is a novel aspect enabled by TIP.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes a dual-modality prompting method called Text-Image Prompting (TIP) that leverages large language models and diffusion models to generate coherent and useful multimodal procedural plans consisting of paired text and image steps towards accomplishing a high-level goal.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- This paper introduces a new task of multimodal procedural planning, where models generate paired text and image plans to provide step-by-step guidance for completing a high-level goal. This is a novel formulation not explored in prior work. - Existing procedural planning work has focused on text-only plan generation, while multimodal generation models like DALL-E explore free-form image generation conditioned on text. This paper combines procedural planning and multimodal generation in a goal-directed way.- The proposed Text-Image Prompting (TIP) method leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and diffusion text-to-image models. It connects these models through dual "bridges" for cross-modality grounding. This technique is innovative compared to simply combining separate text and image generators.- The paper introduces two new datasets, WikiPlan and RecipePlan, to benchmark multimodal procedural planning. This helps fill a gap, as most existing V&L datasets do not have temporally coherent text-image pairs suitable for evaluating procedural planning.- Experiments demonstrate strong improvements over unimodal baselines and simpler multimodal approaches. The gains highlight the benefits of TIP's dual grounding, and the difficulty of coherent multimodal planning.- The task formulation, model architecture, and datasets contribute significantly to the fields of embodied AI, multimodal understanding, and controllable generative modeling. The results show promise for unlocking richer knowledge in large pretrained models.In summary, this paper pushes forward multiple research frontiers with its unique problem setup, technical approach, and introduction of new testbeds. The results validate the value of tighter text-image interaction for multimodal planning.
