# [Multimodal Procedural Planning via Dual Text-Image Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01795)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop models that can generate coherent and useful multimodal (text and image) procedural plans towards achieving a high-level goal?

The key hypothesis seems to be:

By leveraging the reasoning abilities of large language models and the image generation capabilities of diffusion models through a dual prompting approach, we can generate multimodal plans that provide informative, temporally coherent, and accurate guidance for completing tasks.

Specifically, the dual prompting framework called Text-Image Prompting (TIP) uses a Text-to-Image Bridge and Image-to-Text Bridge to ground the text plans in the visual context and vice versa. This allows the model to generate plans that are well-aligned across modalities.

The paper aims to demonstrate that this dual prompting approach enables zero-shot multimodal planning that is superior to unimodal or separately generated multimodal plans in terms of informativeness, coherence, and accuracy. The hypothesis is evaluated on two new datasets for this task.

In summary, the key question is how to elicit strong multimodal planning abilities by combining reasoning from language models and image generation, which is addressed through the proposed TIP framework and evaluated on new multimodal planning datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the multimodal procedural planning (MPP) task, where models are given a high-level goal and generate paired sequences of text and image steps to provide guidance for completing the goal. The key challenges are ensuring informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy across modalities.

2. Proposing Text-Image Prompting (TIP), a dual-modality prompting method that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion text-to-image models. TIP uses two "bridges":

- Text-to-Image Bridge: Uses LLMs to generate explicit scene descriptions that assist the text-to-image model in generating informative, grounded image plans. 

- Image-to-Text Bridge: Verbalizes the image plans using captions and injects them back into the LLM prompt to improve text plan informativeness and grounding.

3. Collecting two new datasets, WikiPlan and RecipePlan, as testbeds for evaluating multimodal procedural planning.

4. Demonstrating through human and automatic evaluations that TIP substantially improves over unimodal and basic multimodal baselines on informativeness, coherence, and accuracy for the MPP task on the collected datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the multimodal procedural planning task and the dual text-image prompting method TIP, along with collecting relevant datasets and showing strong performance improvements over baselines. The dual grounding of text and images is a novel aspect enabled by TIP.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes a dual-modality prompting method called Text-Image Prompting (TIP) that leverages large language models and diffusion models to generate coherent and useful multimodal procedural plans consisting of paired text and image steps towards accomplishing a high-level goal.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper introduces a new task of multimodal procedural planning, where models generate paired text and image plans to provide step-by-step guidance for completing a high-level goal. This is a novel formulation not explored in prior work. 

- Existing procedural planning work has focused on text-only plan generation, while multimodal generation models like DALL-E explore free-form image generation conditioned on text. This paper combines procedural planning and multimodal generation in a goal-directed way.

- The proposed Text-Image Prompting (TIP) method leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and diffusion text-to-image models. It connects these models through dual "bridges" for cross-modality grounding. This technique is innovative compared to simply combining separate text and image generators.

- The paper introduces two new datasets, WikiPlan and RecipePlan, to benchmark multimodal procedural planning. This helps fill a gap, as most existing V&L datasets do not have temporally coherent text-image pairs suitable for evaluating procedural planning.

- Experiments demonstrate strong improvements over unimodal baselines and simpler multimodal approaches. The gains highlight the benefits of TIP's dual grounding, and the difficulty of coherent multimodal planning.

- The task formulation, model architecture, and datasets contribute significantly to the fields of embodied AI, multimodal understanding, and controllable generative modeling. The results show promise for unlocking richer knowledge in large pretrained models.

In summary, this paper pushes forward multiple research frontiers with its unique problem setup, technical approach, and introduction of new testbeds. The results validate the value of tighter text-image interaction for multimodal planning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the performance of multimodal procedural planning models, especially in terms of generating more informative, temporally coherent, and accurate text-image plan pairs. 

- Developing better evaluation metrics and benchmarks to quantify the quality of generated text-image plans. The authors note the lack of suitable automatic evaluation metrics as a current limitation.

- Exploring methods to inject more complex language reasoning abilities from large language models into text-to-image generation models. The authors mention the gap in language understanding capabilities between LLMs and current text-to-image models.

- Pre-training unified multimodal models that have strong capabilities in both text and image generation to further improve multimodal procedural planning.

- Collecting larger-scale datasets with diverse multimodal procedural plans to support further progress on this task.

- Developing personalized multimodal procedural planning models that can take into account individual differences in carrying out procedures.

- Exploring other promising applications of multimodal procedural planning, such as generating tutorials, troubleshooting guides, assembly instructions, etc.

- Addressing ethical concerns around potential biases in large pretrained models and ensuring the generated plans avoid harmful or offensive content.

In summary, the key future directions are improving multimodal plan quality, developing better evaluation methods, leveraging unified multimodal models, collecting richer datasets, supporting personalization, expanding applications, and addressing ethical issues.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the multimodal procedural planning (MPP) task, where models are given a high-level goal and must generate paired sequences of text and image steps that provide complementary guidance for completing the goal. The key challenges are ensuring informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy across modalities. The authors propose Text-Image Prompting (TIP), which uses large language models (LLMs) for text generation and diffusion models for image generation. TIP improves multimodal interaction with a Text-to-Image Bridge, where the LLM provides prompts to guide image generation, and an Image-to-Text Bridge, where image captions are used to refine the text plans. To evaluate MPP, the authors collect the WikiPlan and RecipePlan datasets. Experiments show TIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in human and automatic evaluations. The results demonstrate TIP's ability to elicit knowledge from LLMs and generative models to produce coherent multimodal plans in a zero-shot setting.

The paper presents a multimodal procedural planning task, in which models are given a high-level goal and must generate a sequence of text and image steps that provide complementary guidance to complete the goal. The key challenges are ensuring the informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy of the multimodal plan. The authors propose Text-Image Prompting (TIP), which uses large language models (LLMs) to generate text plans and diffusion models to generate corresponding image plans. TIP improves multimodal grounding through two "bridges": 1) the Text-to-Image Bridge uses the LLM to translate text plans into imaginative prompts for the image model, and 2) the Image-to-Text Bridge translates image plans into captions to prompt the LLM to revise the text plan. The authors collect two datasets, WikiPlan and RecipePlan, to evaluate the task. Results show TIP outperforms unimodal and simple multimodal baselines in human and automatic evaluations of informativeness, coherence, and accuracy. TIP highlights the potential of combining LLMs and generative models for zero-shot multimodal planning.

Experiments demonstrate clear improvements over baselines in generating informative, coherent, and accurate text-image procedural plans. The results highlight the promise of prompting-based techniques for unlocking the multimodal knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern AI systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Text-Image Prompting (TIP), a novel dual-modality prompting framework that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image models for multimodal procedural planning. TIP first generates an initial text plan using an LLM in a zero-shot manner. It then generates a textual-grounded image plan using a Text-to-Image Bridge (T2I-B) which leverages the LLM's reasoning abilities to create explicit scene descriptions that assist the text-to-image model. TIP also generates a visual-grounded text plan using an Image-to-Text Bridge (I2T-B) which verbalizes the image plan using captions and injects them back into the LLM prompt to elicit revision capabilities. By connecting the LLM and text-to-image model via the dual bridges, TIP is able to generate multimodal plans with improved informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy across modalities. The method is evaluated on two collected datasets, WikiPlan and RecipePlan, showing substantial improvements over unimodal and multimodal baselines based on human and automatic metrics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the task of multimodal procedural planning, where models are given a high-level goal and must generate coherent paired sequences of text and image steps that provide useful step-by-step guidance for completing the goal. 

The key challenges they aim to address are:

- Ensuring the generated text and image plans are informative enough in their respective modalities to provide useful guidance. 

- Maintaining temporal coherence across the sequence of multimodal steps.

- Achieving high accuracy and complementarity between the text and image plans.

The paper proposes a dual text-image prompting approach called TIP to tackle these challenges by eliciting and combining the capabilities of language models and text-to-image models. The main innovations seem to be the Text-to-Image Bridge and Image-to-Text Bridge components that allow grounding between the textual and visual modalities.

Overall, the paper is focused on developing models that can generate coherent and accurate multimodal procedural plans to provide human-centric guidance, while addressing the lack of suitable multimodal datasets for this task.
