# [How to Craft Backdoors with Unlabeled Data Alone?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods like SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, etc have shown promising results in learning rich feature representations from unlabeled data alone. However, if the unlabeled datasets used for pretraining SSL models are poisoned with backdoors, it can result in backdoored SSL models that behave erratically on triggered test samples. Prior backdoor attacks require access to labeled data, but the attacker may only have access to unlabeled data. Hence, the authors explore a new strict threat model called "no-label backdoors (NLB)" where the attacker has access only to unlabeled data for poisoning SSL models. The key challenge is selecting a proper poison set without label information.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose two strategies for unlabeled poison set selection:

1) Clustering-based Selection: Apply K-means on SSL features to cluster data and treat each cluster as a pseudo-class. Choose the smallest cluster above poison budget size for poisoning. However, K-means is unstable across initializations.  

2) Contrastive Selection: Derived from a mutual information perspective to maximize dependence between inputs and backdoor selection variable. Choose subset with maximal similarity within (positive pairs) and minimal similarity outside the subset (negative pairs). Implemented efficiently by selecting the anchor sample with highest contrastive score.

Main Contributions:
- Explore a new strict backdoor threat model called no-label backdoors that requires only unlabeled data access 
- Propose two strategies for crafting effective backdoors - clustering using pseudolabels and contrastive selection based on mutual information principle
- Evaluate poisoning against SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, Barlow Twins on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100. Proposed strategies significantly outperform random poisoning.
- Analyze properties of poison set selected, feature representations, and performance against backdoor defenses like finetuning.

In summary, the paper presents the first study of backdoor attacks under a strict unlabeled-only threat model, analyzed proposed strategies extensively and highlighted risks for SSL methods.
