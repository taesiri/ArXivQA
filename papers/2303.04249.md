# [Where We Are and What We're Looking At: Query Based Worldwide Image   Geo-localization Using Hierarchies and Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04249)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve worldwide image geo-localization by learning different visual representations for different geographic hierarchies and scenes. The key hypotheses are:1. Learning separate features for different geographic hierarchies (country, region, city, etc) will improve accuracy compared to learning one set of features for all hierarchies.2. Learning separate features for different scene types (urban, nature, indoor, etc) will allow the model to focus on scene-specific visual cues. 3. Adding more geographic hierarchies beyond the typical 3 levels will further improve accuracy by providing a more fine-grained geographic representation.4. The common testing datasets for geo-localization are biased, so a new more challenging and geographically diverse dataset is needed.So in summary, the main research goals are to improve geo-localization by exploiting geographic hierarchies and scenes, and to create a better benchmark dataset. The core ideas are that different hierarchies and scenes require different features, and that existing datasets have limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a novel approach to worldwide image geo-localization inspired by how humans reason about location. The method uses a set of "hierarchy queries" that learn different features for each level of geographic hierarchy (e.g. country, state, city). 2. It is the first model capable of extracting scene-specific information without needing a separate network for each scene type. It does this by learning query embeddings for different environmental scenes.3. It introduces a new testing dataset called Google-World-Streets-15k that reduces biases compared to previous landmark-focused datasets. The new dataset is more evenly distributed geographically.4. It achieves state-of-the-art results on 4 standard geo-localization datasets as well as the proposed Google-World-Streets-15k dataset.5. It provides qualitative analysis showing the model learns interpretable representations for different geographic hierarchies and scenes.In summary, the main contribution is a new geo-localization method that learns hierarchical and scene-specific features to mimic human geo-localization, validated on standard and new challenging datasets. The hierarchy queries and analysis of their representations are key novel aspects.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new transformer-based architecture for worldwide image geo-localization that learns separate visual features for different geographic hierarchies and scenes via hierarchical cross-attention, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and introducing a more challenging real-world test set.
