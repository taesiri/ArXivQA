# [Where We Are and What We're Looking At: Query Based Worldwide Image   Geo-localization Using Hierarchies and Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04249)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve worldwide image geo-localization by learning different visual representations for different geographic hierarchies and scenes. The key hypotheses are:1. Learning separate features for different geographic hierarchies (country, region, city, etc) will improve accuracy compared to learning one set of features for all hierarchies.2. Learning separate features for different scene types (urban, nature, indoor, etc) will allow the model to focus on scene-specific visual cues. 3. Adding more geographic hierarchies beyond the typical 3 levels will further improve accuracy by providing a more fine-grained geographic representation.4. The common testing datasets for geo-localization are biased, so a new more challenging and geographically diverse dataset is needed.So in summary, the main research goals are to improve geo-localization by exploiting geographic hierarchies and scenes, and to create a better benchmark dataset. The core ideas are that different hierarchies and scenes require different features, and that existing datasets have limitations.
