# [Hyperparameter Tuning with Renyi Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03620)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can the tuning of hyperparameters reveal private information about the training data, and if so, how can we tune hyperparameters in a differentially private manner?

The key points are:

- The authors first illustrate through an example that simply tuning hyperparameters based on non-private training can leak private information about individuals in the training data. This motivates the need for differentially private hyperparameter tuning.

- The authors then provide tools and analysis for tuning hyperparameters with differential privacy. In particular, they show that repeatedly running the training procedure a random number of times and outputting the best result can attain much better privacy guarantees than naive composition. 

- They analyze various distributions on the number of repetitions (truncated negative binomial, Poisson) and show the resulting tradeoff between privacy, utility, and runtime.

- They also demonstrate experimentally that tuning hyperparameters privately can prevent leakage on a CNN trained on MNIST.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that tuning hyperparameters non-privately can leak private information, but this can be prevented by carefully tuning hyperparameters under differential privacy, as analyzed in the paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- Showing that hyperparameter tuning can leak private information if done naively without differential privacy protections. The paper gives an illustrative example of how individual outliers can skew the optimal hyperparameter settings, allowing their presence or absence to be inferred.

- Providing tools to perform differentially private hyperparameter tuning. The paper analyzes repeating the training procedure a random number of times according to various distributions on the number of repetitions. This allows much better privacy guarantees than naive composition while still providing good utility. 

- Analyzing the privacy-utility tradeoff of different distributions on the repetitions, both theoretically and experimentally. Distributions like Poisson and truncated negative binomial are shown to offer good tradeoffs.

- Extending the analysis to approximate differential privacy, not just pure differential privacy. This allows the results to be applied when the base training procedure provides approximate DP guarantees.

- Demonstrating limitations on possible improvements to the privacy analysis. The paper shows examples where their upper bounds are nearly tight.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of differentially private hyperparameter tuning, including positive results showing it is possible to tune hyperparameters privately as well as negative results exploring the limits of what can be proven.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in differential privacy and hyperparameter tuning:

- The paper builds directly on prior work by Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019) on differentially private hyperparameter tuning. It improves upon their results by providing tighter privacy guarantees for various distributions on the number of repetitions of the base algorithm. 

- Most prior work on differentially private machine learning has focused on analyzing the privacy of the overall training procedure. This paper specifically tackles the additional privacy leakage due to hyperparameter tuning, which has received relatively little attention.

- For non-private hyperparameter tuning, there is extensive work on adaptive methods like Bayesian optimization. This paper focuses on non-adaptive "random search" for hyperparameter tuning under differential privacy. The adaptive setting was also studied recently by Mohapatra et al. (2021).

- The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of privacy guarantees for different distributions on the number of repetitions. The experiments are simple proof-of-concept on MNIST rather than a large-scale empirical evaluation.

- The techniques draw on and extend the rich literature on RÃ©nyi differential privacy. The proofs rely on probability generating functions, which provide a useful tool for analyzing repetitions of randomized algorithms.

- Overall, this paper makes an important contribution by formalizing and solving the problem of differentially private hyperparameter tuning. It provides solid theoretical grounding and improves upon prior art. The theoretical results seem fairly tight, but more empirical validation on complex models would be useful future work.

In summary, the paper advances the state-of-the-art in differentially private ML by tackling the open problem of hyperparameter tuning and providing theoretical guarantees backed by analysis and experiments. It builds nicely on prior work and introduces useful technical tools.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing techniques to enable safe and effective hyperparameter tuning under differential privacy in adaptive settings, where the choice of hyperparameters depends on previous tuning rounds. The paper focuses on non-adaptive "random search" for hyperparameter tuning.

- Extending the theoretical analysis to other common differential privacy mechanisms beyond noisy stochastic gradient descent, such as the Gaussian mechanism. 

- Exploring whether the privacy guarantees can be further tightened, especially for heavy-tailed distributions like the truncated negative binomial. The paper provides some intuition that major improvements may be difficult.

- Applying the techniques developed to carry out full hyperparameter tuning on complex models like neural networks, and evaluating the tradeoffs empirically. The paper demonstrates the approach on tuning only the learning rate for a CNN.

- Extending the analysis to the high-privacy regime with smaller epsilon values, whereas the paper focuses on moderate privacy.

- Developing methods to automatically select the optimal distribution on number of repetitions for a given privacy budget and base algorithm. The tradeoffs between distributions are complex.

- Exploring connections to the private selection problem more deeply. The paper shows the results can match exponential mechanism for selection up to constants.

In summary, the authors point to several interesting open questions around tightening the analysis, expanding the techniques to broader settings, and better understanding the tradeoffs empirically.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents theoretical results on the privacy implications of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. The authors first show through a simple example that tuning hyperparameters in a non-private manner can leak private information about training data. Motivated by this, they provide tools for tuning hyperparameters privately by repeating a differentially private training procedure a random number of times and outputting the best result. They analyze the privacy guarantees for various distributions on the number of repetitions, including truncated negative binomial and Poisson distributions. The results show that, under certain assumptions, hyperparameter tuning can be done privately with modest privacy cost if each training run is differentially private. The paper also discusses the utility tradeoffs with different repetition distributions. Overall, it provides a rigorous analysis of private hyperparameter tuning and demonstrates that it is feasible with appropriate algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the problem of differentially private hyperparameter tuning. The authors first motivate the problem by showing that simply tuning hyperparameters in a non-private manner can leak private information about individuals in the training data. They give a simple example with an SVM model where the presence of outliers in the training data noticeably affects which hyperparameter values give the best model accuracy. This could enable membership inference attacks. 

The authors then present an algorithm for differential private hyperparameter tuning. The algorithm runs a differentially private training procedure with candidate hyperparameter values a random number of times, following some distribution, and returns the best model produced over all these runs. The privacy analysis shows that, with an appropriate distribution on the number of repetitions (e.g. Poisson or truncated negative binomial), strong privacy guarantees can be obtained even as the expected number of repetitions grows. Experiments on tuning the learning rate of a CNN on MNIST confirm that this technique enables privately tuning hyperparameters with minimal loss in model accuracy compared to a non-private search.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method for differentially private hyperparameter tuning. The algorithm runs a base model training algorithm with candidate hyperparameter values a random number of times K, where K is drawn from a carefully chosen distribution, such as the Poisson or truncated negative binomial distribution. The algorithm returns the trained model with the best validation performance across all runs. By randomly repeating the base model training instead of running it a fixed number of times, the composition properties of differential privacy allow much better privacy guarantees. The paper proves privacy bounds for this approach under RÃ©nyi differential privacy for different choices of distributions for K. Experiments validate that the approach improves privacy for hyperparameter tuning compared to naive composition, while retaining good model accuracy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces techniques for differentially private hyperparameter tuning, showing how to bound privacy leakage from repeated runs needed for tuning through the lens of Renyi differential privacy; it provides a tighter analysis compared to naive composition and gives both theoretical results for various distributions on number of repetitions as well as an experimental demonstration on MNIST.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of hyperparameter tuning with differential privacy. Specifically:

- Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting good values for the hyperparameters of a machine learning model or algorithm. This often involves training models multiple times with different hyperparameter configurations and selecting the best configuration. 

- Differential privacy provides strong privacy guarantees for algorithms operating on sensitive data. Many differentially private training algorithms like DP-SGD have been proposed. 

- However, the privacy analysis for these algorithms typically only considers a single training run. Hyperparameter tuning involves multiple training runs, so it can potentially leak more information. 

- This paper studies whether tuning hyperparameters privately can reveal private information about individuals in the training data. It aims to understand the privacy implications of hyperparameter tuning and provide tools to tune hyperparameters with differential privacy.

In summary, the key question is how to properly account for the privacy loss/leakage when tuning hyperparameters of differentially private learning algorithms. The paper aims to formally study this problem and provide solutions.

The paper provides privacy analyses for different distributions on the number of repetitions like truncated negative binomial and Poisson, showing tradeoffs between privacy, utility, and computation time. Overall, the key ideas revolve around formally quantifying the privacy guarantees for common hyperparameter tuning procedures under differential privacy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new algorithm for differentially private hyperparameter tuning. How does this algorithm compare to prior work on private hyperparameter tuning, such as the analysis based on stability in Chaudhuri and Vinterbo (2013)? What are the advantages of the approach taken in this paper?

2. The privacy analysis in the paper relies on RÃ©nyi differential privacy. Why is this preferred over analyzingprivacy loss in terms of (Îµ,Î´)-differential privacy? What benefits does the RÃ©nyi DP framework provide for analyzing the privacy of this algorithm? 

3. The main technical lemma (Lemma 3) provides a bound on the RÃ©nyi divergence between the outputs of the repeated algorithm in terms of the probability generating function of the number of repetitions. Can you walk through the key steps in the proof of this result? How does it relate the privacy guarantee back to properties of the repetition distribution?

4. The paper analyzes privacy for several distributions on the number of repetitions, such as truncated negative binomial and Poisson. Why are these distributions chosen? What are the tradeoffs between them in terms of privacy, utility, and concentration?

5. How does the privacy analysis deal with the issue of post-processing? The final output involves taking the best result over multiple runs - how is this handled in the proofs?

6. One of the results shows that using a logarithmic distribution for the number of repetitions gives better privacy than a geometric distribution, which was suggested in prior work. Can you explain intuitively why the logarithmic distribution performs better?

7. The utility analysis relies on studying the expected quantile of the output. Why is quantile used to measure utility here rather than something like expected accuracy or loss? What does the quantile tell us about the utility of the algorithm?

8. The paper shows both positive and negative results. What is the significance of the negative result that repeating a fixed number of times does not yield good privacy? How does the positive result circumvent this issue?

9. How do the results extend to the case where the base algorithm satisfies approximate (Îµ,Î´)-differential privacy rather than RÃ©nyi DP? Can you summarize the main idea behind extending the analysis to this case?

10. One limitation mentioned is that the results apply specifically to non-adaptive hyperparameter tuning algorithms. Can you suggest ways the analysis could be extended to adaptive methods like Bayesian optimization while preserving the privacy guarantees?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes a framework for training differentially private deep learning models with RÃ©nyi differential privacy (RDP). The key idea is to tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and noise multiplier in a privacy-preserving way by repeating training multiple times with different hyperparameters sampled randomly from predefined ranges. 

The authors first motivate the need for private hyperparameter tuning by showing how tuning hyperparameters based on model accuracy can leak private information about individual training examples. They then present their algorithm which runs stochastic gradient descent with DP-SGD a random number of times, returning the model and hyperparameters with the best performance. The privacy analysis uses the probability generating function of the random number of repetitions and provides RDP guarantees that only grow logarithmically with the expected number of repetitions.

The paper analytically compares privacy-utility tradeoffs for different distributions on the number of repetitions like Poisson, geometric, and truncated negative binomial. The utility analysis studies the probability of finding a good model and also characterizes the expected quantile performance. Finally, experiments on tuning the learning rate of a CNN on MNIST validate that Poisson sampling of hyperparameters provides the best tradeoff.

Overall, this is a novel application of RDP to enable practical hyperparameter tuning for DP machine learning with formal privacy guarantees. By carefully analyzing the privacy amplification from sampling hyperparameters randomly, the paper develops an approach that provides compelling utility without excessive privacy cost. The analytical results delineate the advantages of different probability distributions for the number of repetitions.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How has the development of targeted ransomware affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations, and what insights can game theory provide into responding to ransomware attacks?

The authors state this focus early on in the Introduction:

"In this paper, we consider how the development of targeted ransomware has affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations to better understand how to respond to ransomware attacks."

They then construct a game theory model of ransomware negotiations to analyze the strategies and investments a malicious actor must make to conduct a successful targeted attack. The goal is to gain new insights into real-world ransomware behavior and optimal response strategies.

So in summary, the main research focus is on using game theory to model targeted ransomware negotiations, in order to elucidate how the dynamics have changed and determine optimal responses. The hypothesis is that game theory can provide useful insights into these ransomware attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker (malicious actor operating ransomware) and a defender (targeted organization). The key features of the model are:

- It focuses on the attacker's investments in reliability of the ransomware, estimating the value of the target's data, and level of aggression in negotiations. 

- It shows how imperfect information leads to the necessity of negotiations, in contrast to a trivial "ideal scenario" where the attacker has perfect information.

- It demonstrates through analysis and simulations that the attacker's optimal strategy balances investment and aggression, rather than maximizing aggression.

- It provides insights into real-world ransomware negotiation strategies and dynamics through the game theory framework. 

Overall, the main contribution is using game theory to model ransomware negotiations in a novel way that captures key features of real-world targeted ransomware campaigns. The analysis provides new theoretical understanding of ransomware negotiation dynamics and strategies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between attackers and targets to understand the dynamics and optimal strategies involved.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of ransomware modeling:

- The use of game theory to model ransomware negotiations is a relatively new approach. Some other papers have used game theory, but focused on different aspects like deterrence or incentive to return data. This paper provides a detailed game theoretic model specifically focused on the dynamics of ransom negotiations.

- Most prior ransomware modeling research has not focused on targeted ransomware attacks on large organizations. This paper incorporates unique features of targeted ransomware like the attacker's need to invest in estimating the value of the target's data. 

- The model includes imperfect information as a key element affecting the negotiations. Many game theory models assume perfect information, but this paper shows how imperfect information leads to non-trivial optimal strategies.

- Compared to basic economic or cost-benefit models of ransomware, this game theory approach provides more strategic insights into the behavior of attackers and defenders. However, the tradeoff is that game theory models require more simplifying assumptions.

- The detailed numerical analysis of the model parameters and profit landscapes goes beyond high-level game theory and shows how the results match with agent-based simulations. This helps verify the model reflects real-world dynamics.

- Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution by bringing game theory modeling to targeted ransomware negotiations. The analysis provides new strategic insights compared to prior ransomware research. The results highlight the importance of balancing aggression and investment for ransomware attackers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Incorporating the attacker's investment in circumventing the defender's security into the model. The paper currently focuses just on the ransom negotiation stage and does not account for the attacker's efforts to breach the defender's systems. Adding this element could allow for modeling deterrence effects based on the defender's security investments.

- Expanding the model to allow for multiple rounds of negotiation offers and counteroffers over time. The current model simplifies the process into a single offer and counteroffer. A more complex negotiation process may reveal additional insights. 

- Considering other factors that influence the ransom amount and negotiation, such as the attacker's costs of providing decryption support and files. The model currently focuses just on reliability of decryption. 

- Analyzing targeted ransomware strains in more detail to quantify differences in aggression, reliability, accuracy, and other model parameters. The paper currently uses illustrative values for these parameters. More precise values could improve the model's accuracy.

- Expanding the model to account for the sale of stolen data during targeted attacks, not just ransom for decryption keys. The dynamics around data theft and extortion could produce further insights.

- Applying game theory to model ransomware scenarios beyond just targeted attacks, such as mass untargeted ransomware campaigns. Different attack types may require modifications or entirely new models.

In summary, the authors propose enhancing the model's complexity and linkage to real-world data, expanding its scope to related ransomware scenarios, and diversifying the factors considered in the negotiation dynamics. Game theory provides a useful foundation to analyze ransomware economics and interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker operating targeted ransomware and a defender organization that has been infected. The model focuses on three key elements of the attacker's strategy that affect negotiations - aggression, investment in reliability of the ransomware, and investment in estimating the value of the target's data. By analyzing the model, the authors show how imperfect information necessitates negotiation and determines optimal strategies. They find the attacker must balance investment and aggression to maximize profit, rather than being infinitely aggressive. The analysis provides insights into real-world ransomware negotiations by modeling the interaction of strategy elements under imperfect information. Overall, the paper applies game theory concepts to model ransomware negotiations and gain a better understanding of the behavior and incentives of actors involved.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper constructs a game theory model to analyze the dynamics of ransomware negotiations between attackers operating targeted ransomware strains and organizations targeted for attack. The model focuses on three key elements of the attacker's strategy: investment in circumventing the target's security, investment in the reliability of the ransomware code, and investment in estimating the value the target places on their encrypted data. The negotiation is modeled as a two-player game, with the attacker making a ransom demand and the target making a counteroffer. If the counteroffer is too low, the attacker may react aggressively by refusing to provide the decryption key. 

Through analysis of the model, the authors show how imperfect information necessitates negotiation, as the attacker can never perfectly estimate the target's valuation of their data. The optimal level of aggression balances the attacker's ability to demand higher ransoms against the risk of aggressive rejection of reasonable counteroffers. The model demonstrates how the key elements of the attacker's strategy interact, and that a balanced investment and aggression strategy maximizes the attacker's expected profit. The insights from this game theory model can aid in understanding the real-world behavior of targeted ransomware operators.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper constructs a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker operating targeted ransomware and a defender organization targeted by the attacker. The model focuses on three key elements of the attacker's strategy: investment in reliability of the ransomware, investment in estimating the value of the target's data, and level of aggression in negotiations. The negotiation is modeled as a two-player non-cooperative game with imperfect information. The defender makes a counteroffer to the attacker's ransom demand, and the attacker either accepts the counteroffer or aggressively rejects it based on a probability related to their aggression level. The model is analyzed to find optimal strategies for both players. Numerical integration and agent-based simulations demonstrate that the attacker's optimal strategy balances investment and aggression levels, rather than maximizing aggression. The imperfect information arising from the attacker's uncertain estimate of the data value makes non-trivial negotiation strategies necessary.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of how targeted ransomware attacks have affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations. In particular, it focuses on how the investments a malicious actor must make to conduct a successful targeted ransomware attack influence the negotiations with the victim organization.  

The key questions examined in the paper are:

- How do a malicious actor's investments in reliability of their ransomware and estimating the value of the victim's data affect ransom negotiations?

- How does imperfect information between the malicious actor and victim organization lead to the necessity of negotiations? 

- What is the optimal negotiation strategy for the malicious actor to balance aggression and investment?

In summary, the paper aims to gain insights into real-world ransomware negotiation dynamics by constructing a game theory model focusing on the malicious actor's investments and imperfect information. The analysis provides guidance on responding to targeted ransomware attacks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

10. The model relies on precise mathematical analysis. What are the tradeoffs versus using a computational or simulation approach? Could the two methods complement each other?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a game theory model to analyze the negotiation dynamics between attackers using targeted ransomware and organizations targeted for ransom. It focuses on how the rise of targeted ransomware has changed the dynamics compared to traditional untargeted ransomware. The model considers three key investments the attacker must make to successfully deploy targeted ransomware: circumventing the target's security, developing reliable ransomware, and estimating the value of the target's data. The negotiation is modeled as the attacker making a ransom demand, the target making a counteroffer, and the attacker deciding whether to accept the counteroffer or react aggressively by abandoning negotiations. The probability of an aggressive reaction increases as the counteroffer decreases. The analysis shows the target's optimal counteroffer depends on the attacker's aggression level and reliability of their ransomware. Meanwhile, the attacker's optimal initial demand depends on their estimate of the target's data value. Imperfect information, specifically the uncertainty in estimating data value, makes negotiation necessary by introducing the risk of aggressive rejection. Numerically integrating over possible data values demonstrates the attacker maximizes profit through a balance of aggression, reliability investment, and estimating accuracy, rather than maximal aggression. This highlights how game theory can provide useful insights into ransomware negotiation dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper models targeted ransomware negotiations as a game between an attacker and a defender, analyzing how the attacker's strategies regarding aggression, ransomware reliability, and estimating the value of the target's data interact to determine the outcome.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker operating targeted ransomware and a defender organization targeted for attack. The model focuses on three key elements of the attacker's strategy that affect negotiations - aggression, reliability of the ransomware, and accuracy in estimating the value of the target's data. Through analysis of the model, the authors show how imperfect information necessitates negotiations where aggressive reactions may occur. They demonstrate how the elements of the attacker's strategy interact, with investments in reliability and estimation accuracy counteracting inherently aggressive tendencies. Numerical analysis reveals an optimal balance of moderate aggression with sufficient investment for maximizing the attacker's expected profit. The insights provided on factors influencing ransomware negotiations can aid in understanding and responding to real-world ransomware attacks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper models the ransomware negotiations as a non-cooperative two-player game between an attacker and a defender. What are some limitations of modeling the negotiations this way, rather than as a cooperative game or with more players? How might the dynamics change if the model was expanded?

2. The paper makes assumptions about the attacker's investments, such as in reliability of the ransomware. How reasonable are these assumptions and functional forms chosen (e.g. Eq 1 for Î²)? What empirical data could help refine or validate the investment models? 

3. Information asymmetry is noted as a key feature of the negotiations. What other forms of imperfect information might be present beyond uncertainty in the data value? How could unknown information like the defender's cost tolerance impact the model?

4. The negotiation process is simplified to a single demand, counteroffer, and accept/reject decision. What nuances of real-world ransomware negotiations are lost with this simplification? How could a more complex negotiation process be modeled?

5. The model assumes the attacker always attempts to provide the decryption key if paid. Under what circumstances might an attacker choose not to decrypt files after payment? How would this change the defender's strategy?

6. The attacker's aggression parameter a is defined in Eq 2. What real-world factors might influence a? How might a be estimated empirically? Are there better definitions that capture observed behavior?

7. The distribution of the attacker's data value estimate in Eq 3 is lognormal. What evidence supports this versus other distributions? What sensitivity analysis could be done on the distribution choice? 

8. The analytic results rely on finding a closed form solution. What numerical methods could provide more flexibility in relaxing assumptions? Where might simulations add insight?

9. The model focuses on profit maximization. How well does this capture real-world goals versus intangibles like reputation? What model changes might better address multiple objectives?

10. What empirical data could be used to test the model validity and refine the parameter estimates? How might the theoretical results guide real-world data collection?
