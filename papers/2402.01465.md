## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Motion planning for autonomous vehicles faces challenges in navigating complex, unpredictable environments while ensuring safety. Traditional analytical methods lack flexibility, and machine learning approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) suffer from instability and interpretability issues. This creates a need for enhanced decision-making capabilities and adaptability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a novel hybrid motion planning approach combining an analytical sampling-based planner with an RL agent that adjusts the planner's cost weights dynamically. 

- The sampling-based planner generates and evaluates hundreds of trajectories in a Frenet frame every timestep using environment predictions.

- The RL agent observes information on ego vehicle states, goals, surroundings, trajectories, and costs to select actions that tune the planner's cost weights for collision probability, jerk etc. Its rewards promote driving safety and efficiency.

- This unique integration of the robustness of analytical methods with the adaptability of RL aims to bridge theory and practical application for autonomous driving.

Main Contributions:
- A hybrid planning architecture synergizing analytical and machine learning approaches to leverage their complementary strengths.  

- Extensive quantitative analysis indicating the hybrid method reduces collisions, risk, and improves lane-goal success rate across various test scenarios.

- An open source framework to enable further research into such hybrid autonomous driving systems.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative methodology combining analytical and learning techniques for adaptable yet safe motion planning along with insights from comprehensive testing, advancing the state-of-the-art in this critical domain. The hybrid design attempts to balance performance, stability and interpretability - key factors for real-world autonomous navigation.
