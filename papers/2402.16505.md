# [Memory GAPS: Would LLMs pass the Tulving Test?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper investigates whether Endel Tulving's framework and experiments on human memory from over 40 years ago can shed light on the memory capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it looks at Tulving's "General Abstract Processing System" (GAPS) model and the distinction between episodic and semantic memory.

Proposed Solution
- The paper transposes Tulving's "direct comparison" experiments that tested recognition versus recall for lists of words in human subjects to LLMs. It compares the results from the LLM memory tests to the original human experiments.  

- The direct comparison tests memory by asking subjects to recognize words from studied lists and recall associated words when prompted. Tests are done both immediately after studying the list and after a delay.

- The framework also introduces the concept of "ecphoric information", which is the output of the retrieval processes that determines recollective experience. This is compared to the vector embeddings and output probabilities in the Transformer architecture underlying LLMs.

Key Findings
- In immediate recognition tests, the LLM performed perfectly on recognizing studied words, unlike human subjects. However, its performance dropped significantly after a delay, more so than humans.

- In recall tests, the LLM performed worse than humans in immediately recalling words from the studied list when prompted with the same words. Its performance decreased further with delays.

- The paper hypothesizes that semantic memory from the LLM's pretraining dominates over formation of new episodic traces. This could account for poorer delayed recall performance compared to humans.

- Overall, the experiments demonstrate similarities and differences in the ecphoric processes hypothesized to underlie retrieval of episodic memories in LLMs versus humans.

Contributions
- Provides a novel framework for evaluating memory capabilities of LLMs based on seminal human memory research.

- Identifies quantitative differences in how LLMs utilize retrieval cues versus episodic memory traces compared to human memory.

- Opens up further research directions on modeling ecphory processes in LLMs based on their learned probability distributions.
