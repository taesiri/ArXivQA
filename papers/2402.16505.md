# [Memory GAPS: Would LLMs pass the Tulving Test?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16505)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper investigates whether Endel Tulving's framework and experiments on human memory from over 40 years ago can shed light on the memory capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it looks at Tulving's "General Abstract Processing System" (GAPS) model and the distinction between episodic and semantic memory.

Proposed Solution
- The paper transposes Tulving's "direct comparison" experiments that tested recognition versus recall for lists of words in human subjects to LLMs. It compares the results from the LLM memory tests to the original human experiments.  

- The direct comparison tests memory by asking subjects to recognize words from studied lists and recall associated words when prompted. Tests are done both immediately after studying the list and after a delay.

- The framework also introduces the concept of "ecphoric information", which is the output of the retrieval processes that determines recollective experience. This is compared to the vector embeddings and output probabilities in the Transformer architecture underlying LLMs.

Key Findings
- In immediate recognition tests, the LLM performed perfectly on recognizing studied words, unlike human subjects. However, its performance dropped significantly after a delay, more so than humans.

- In recall tests, the LLM performed worse than humans in immediately recalling words from the studied list when prompted with the same words. Its performance decreased further with delays.

- The paper hypothesizes that semantic memory from the LLM's pretraining dominates over formation of new episodic traces. This could account for poorer delayed recall performance compared to humans.

- Overall, the experiments demonstrate similarities and differences in the ecphoric processes hypothesized to underlie retrieval of episodic memories in LLMs versus humans.

Contributions
- Provides a novel framework for evaluating memory capabilities of LLMs based on seminal human memory research.

- Identifies quantitative differences in how LLMs utilize retrieval cues versus episodic memory traces compared to human memory.

- Opens up further research directions on modeling ecphory processes in LLMs based on their learned probability distributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the applicability of Endel Tulving's psychological framework of memory, the General Abstract Processing System (GAPS), for assessing and comparing memory performance in Large Language Models versus human subjects through recognition and recall experiments inspired by Tulving's direct comparison tests.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates the applicability of Endel Tulving's General Abstract Processing System (GAPS) framework and Synergistic Ecphory Model (SEM) of human memory to understanding the memory processes and performance of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it adapts Tulving's "direct comparison" experiments that compare memory recognition versus recall in humans to test memory in LLMs. The key findings are:

1) LLMs demonstrate some similarities but also significant differences compared to human memory performance, such as perfect immediate recognition but very poor delayed recall especially when prompted with copy cues. 

2) The differences suggest the relative balance of semantic knowledge versus episodic memory traces may be weighted more heavily toward semantic knowledge in LLMs compared to humans. 

3) The GAPS framework, especially the SEM model of ecphoric information based on the synergy of engram traces and retrieval cues, provides a useful lens for understanding differences in the memory processes of LLMs versus humans.

In summary, the paper makes a contribution in applying Tulving's seminal memory frameworks to analyze and compare memory in large language models versus human subjects. The findings shed light on the current capabilities but also limitations of LLMs in emulating human memory.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Tulving Test - A test designed by Endel Tulving to assess memory performance in recognition and recall tasks. Used in the paper to evaluate LLMs.

- GAPS (General Abstract Processing System) - A pretheoretical framework proposed by Tulving to understand remembering and memory. Includes concepts like encoding, retrieval, engrams, ecphory. 

- Ecphory - The process that brings relevant information in the retrieval environment into interaction with the stored memory trace or engram.

- Engram - The stored memory trace resulting from encoding a past event or episode. 

- Episodic memory - Memory for personal past events and episodes. Assessed in the Tulving Test.

- Semantic memory - General world knowledge not tied to personal episodes. Accessed by cues in the Tulving Test.

- Transformer architecture - The neural network architecture used by LLMs, which has some analogies to the GAPS framework.

- Vector embeddings - The vector representations of words and sentences learned by the Transformer encoder. Hypothesized to be related to engrams.

- Recognition versus recall - The two distinct memory retrieval tasks compared in the Tulving Test. Assess familiarity vs. identification.

So in summary - GAPS, ecphory, engrams, episodic memory, Transformer architectures and semantics are key concepts examined in relation to the Tulving Test of LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using the LLM CLI utility and library to run experiments interacting with LLMs. What are some key capabilities of this library that enabled conducting the experiments? How does it simplify working with LLMs?

2. The process of selecting the 48 words for the study list and corresponding cue words is described briefly. What considerations went into choosing effective cue words of different types (associated, rhyming, unrelated)? How might this impact experimental results?

3. What was the rationale behind running the recognition and recall tests twice - once immediate and once delayed? How do the differences in results help analyze the workings of LLM memory? 

4. The paper analyzes LLM memory performance using concepts like cue valence and conversion thresholds from Tulving's framework. How are these concepts quantified? Can they be adapted to analyze LLMs beyond empirical test performance?

5. What changes were required in the original Tulving framework to tailor the direct comparison experiment format to assessing LLM memory capabilities? What dimensions were considered?

6. The LLM memory capabilities are compared to human memory quantitatively using the test data. What qualitative differences come across and how may concepts like synergistic ecphory be balanced differently? 

7. How can the high immediate recognition performance but contrasting recall performance be analyzed using notions of encoding strength versus information reliability from retrieval cues?

8. Why do rhyming cues fail at retrieving target words from the study list in delayed recall tests? How can the context length limit of LLMs provide an explanation?  

9. The failure of copy cues in delayed recall tests points to pretrained semantic associations overriding episodic memory. How can this hypothesis be tested more definitively?

10. The GAPS elements provide loose analogies to Transformer encoder-decoder paradigms. Can these be developed into a detailed conceptual framework mapping LLM memory processes to psychological concepts?
