## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis enables exploring cellular heterogeneity and diversity, but traditional clustering methods often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, which is crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies.  
- Existing graph neural network (GNN) based methods face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimensionality and high-sparsity.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose scCDCG, a novel framework for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information.

Main Components:
- A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques that effectively captures intercellular structural information while avoiding issues with GNNs.
- A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to handle scRNA-seq data's high dimensionality and sparsity.  
- An autoencoder-based feature learning module that reduces complexity via dimension reduction and feature extraction.

Key Contributions:
- Propose scCDCG, which is suitable for clustering high-dimensional and sparse scRNA-seq data, exploiting intercellular structural information while avoiding limitations of GNNs.
- Introduce a self-supervised learning module via optimal transport to accommodate scRNA-seq data complexity.  
- Demonstrate superior performance and efficiency of scCDCG over 7 established models on 6 real-world scRNA-seq datasets.
- Perform comprehensive ablation studies validating the necessity of each module.

In summary, scCDCG is an innovative framework for accurate and efficient clustering of scRNA-seq data, overcoming limitations in prior methods. It shows great promise as a tool for bioinformatics advancements.
