# [SurfaceAug: Closing the Gap in Multimodal Ground Truth Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal (camera + LiDAR) detectors barely outperform LiDAR-only methods on benchmarks like KITTI. This has been attributed to weaker augmentation strategies caused by the difficulty of preserving cross-modal correspondences. 
- Prior works lack object-level transformations like rotation and scaling that are commonly used to augment LiDAR-only detectors.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose SurfaceAug, a new multimodal ground truth sampling algorithm that enables object-level transformations by resampling both the image and point cloud when pasting objects.

Key Contributions:
- Resamples images by raycasting camera rays against a surface mesh of the pasted object, then sampling colors from the source image.
- Resamples point clouds by raycasting simulated LiDAR rays against the mesh, keeping intersections that fall on the instance mask.
- Simulates LiDAR intensity values using an interpolant and the LiDAR range equation.
- Defines rules to sample valid placements and limit distortion when pasting objects.
- Trains MVX-Net on KITTI using SurfaceAug and outperforms prior augmentation methods, achieving new SOTA for multimodal ground truth sampling.

In summary, the key innovation of SurfaceAug is the use of a surface mesh representation to enable multimodal object-level transformations during ground truth sampling. Experiments show this leads to improved performance compared to prior augmentation techniques.
