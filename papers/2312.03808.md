# [SurfaceAug: Closing the Gap in Multimodal Ground Truth Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal (camera + LiDAR) detectors barely outperform LiDAR-only methods on benchmarks like KITTI. This has been attributed to weaker augmentation strategies caused by the difficulty of preserving cross-modal correspondences. 
- Prior works lack object-level transformations like rotation and scaling that are commonly used to augment LiDAR-only detectors.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose SurfaceAug, a new multimodal ground truth sampling algorithm that enables object-level transformations by resampling both the image and point cloud when pasting objects.

Key Contributions:
- Resamples images by raycasting camera rays against a surface mesh of the pasted object, then sampling colors from the source image.
- Resamples point clouds by raycasting simulated LiDAR rays against the mesh, keeping intersections that fall on the instance mask.
- Simulates LiDAR intensity values using an interpolant and the LiDAR range equation.
- Defines rules to sample valid placements and limit distortion when pasting objects.
- Trains MVX-Net on KITTI using SurfaceAug and outperforms prior augmentation methods, achieving new SOTA for multimodal ground truth sampling.

In summary, the key innovation of SurfaceAug is the use of a surface mesh representation to enable multimodal object-level transformations during ground truth sampling. Experiments show this leads to improved performance compared to prior augmentation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

SurfaceAug is a new multimodal data augmentation method that pastes objects by resampling both images and point clouds to enable object-level transformations, outperforming prior work on car detection tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new multimodal ground truth sampling algorithm called SurfaceAug that enables object-level transformations of pasted objects in both images and point clouds. Specifically:

- SurfaceAug introduces a method to preserve multimodal consistency across out-of-plane transformations by using an intermediate surface mesh representation of objects. 

- It formulates rules to ensure realistic placement and appearance of pasted objects.

- It proposes a mathematical approach to simulate LiDAR intensity values.

- It shows experimentally that training the MVX-Net detector on KITTI data augmented with SurfaceAug improves performance on car detection over previous augmentation methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for multimodal ground truth sampling.

So in summary, the key contribution is the SurfaceAug algorithm that advances multimodal data augmentation through its ability to paste transformed objects while preserving cross-modality correspondences. This helps close the performance gap between multimodal and LiDAR-only detectors.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Multimodal object detection
- Sensor fusion
- LiDAR and camera fusion
- Data augmentation
- Ground truth sampling
- SurfaceAug (the proposed method)
- Point cloud and image resampling
- Object-level transformations
- KITTI dataset
- 3D bounding box detection
- Sim2real gap
- LiDAR intensity modeling
- LiDAR and camera ray tracing
- Mesh reconstruction 
- Pose graph optimization

The paper proposes a new data augmentation method called SurfaceAug for training multimodal (LiDAR and camera) object detectors. It focuses on ground truth sampling, where additional labeled instances of objects are synthetically added to the training data. SurfaceAug is able to resample and transform entire objects in both the LiDAR point cloud and camera image to enable more diverse and realistic data augmentation. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate improved performance over prior work, especially for 3D car detection. So the key themes are multimodal detection, data augmentation through ground truth sampling, liDAR and camera consistency, and outperforming prior methods.
