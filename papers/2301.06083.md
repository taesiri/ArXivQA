# [Discrete Point-wise Attack Is Not Enough: Generalized Manifold   Adversarial Attack for Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a more effective adversarial attack method for face recognition models that produces adversarial examples with better generalization ability and higher attack success rates? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Existing adversarial attack methods for face recognition models tend to overfit to particular image factors like expression or makeup when attacking a single image. This results in poor generalization to other unseen images of the target identity. 

2) Expanding the attack to multiple images of a target identity, representing different states like expressions, will improve generalization of the adversarial examples.

3) Leveraging domain knowledge like facial action coding to generate a continuous manifold of adversarial examples, rather than just discrete examples, will further enhance attack effectiveness.

4) Adding constraints and supervisory signals based on facial structure can improve the visual quality of the generated adversarial examples.

The central goal is to develop a new adversarial attack method called Generalized Manifold Adversarial Attack (GMAA) that expands the attack to multiple target identity states and generates a continuous semantic manifold of adversarial examples to achieve better generalization, higher attack success rate, and more natural appearance compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed GMAA approach actually achieves these hypothesized improvements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a new paradigm called Generalized Manifold Adversarial Attack (GMAA) for generating adversarial examples against face recognition systems. 

- GMAA expands both the target domain and adversarial domain compared to previous attack methods:
  - For the target domain, it attacks a state set of the target identity rather than a single image, which improves generalization.
  - For the adversarial domain, it leverages domain knowledge (facial expressions) to expand from discrete points to a continuous manifold, strengthening the attack.
  
- It instantiates GMAA using facial expressions as the domain knowledge, allowing generation of semantically continuous adversarial examples by interpolating between expression codes.

- As a minor contribution, it uses expression editors for dual supervision of global structure and local texture to improve visual quality.

- Through extensive experiments, it demonstrates the improved attack success rate, generalization ability, and visual quality of GMAA compared to prior methods.

In summary, the key novelty is the new GMAA paradigm that expands both the target and adversarial domains to enhance attack performance. It is instantiated for faces using expression as domain knowledge for a semantically continuous adversarial manifold.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new paradigm called Generalized Manifold Adversarial Attack (GMAA) to enhance adversarial attack performance on face recognition models by expanding the target domain to attack multiple states of an identity and leveraging facial expression editing techniques and domain knowledge to expand the adversarial domain from discrete points to continuous manifolds.
