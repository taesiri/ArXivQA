# [Discrete Point-wise Attack Is Not Enough: Generalized Manifold   Adversarial Attack for Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a more effective adversarial attack method for face recognition models that produces adversarial examples with better generalization ability and higher attack success rates? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Existing adversarial attack methods for face recognition models tend to overfit to particular image factors like expression or makeup when attacking a single image. This results in poor generalization to other unseen images of the target identity. 

2) Expanding the attack to multiple images of a target identity, representing different states like expressions, will improve generalization of the adversarial examples.

3) Leveraging domain knowledge like facial action coding to generate a continuous manifold of adversarial examples, rather than just discrete examples, will further enhance attack effectiveness.

4) Adding constraints and supervisory signals based on facial structure can improve the visual quality of the generated adversarial examples.

The central goal is to develop a new adversarial attack method called Generalized Manifold Adversarial Attack (GMAA) that expands the attack to multiple target identity states and generates a continuous semantic manifold of adversarial examples to achieve better generalization, higher attack success rate, and more natural appearance compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed GMAA approach actually achieves these hypothesized improvements.
