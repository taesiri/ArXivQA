## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring prompt-based learning for more tasks beyond classification and generation, such as information extraction and text analysis tasks. The authors note that applying prompting methods to these tasks is less straightforward and will likely require reformulating the tasks or performing effective answer engineering.

- Improving answer engineering, including developing methods to handle tasks with many classes or long answers, and finding ways to deal with multiple valid answers for generation tasks.

- Doing more systematic studies to understand the tradeoffs between different prompt tuning strategies. The field currently lacks a clear understanding of when to use strategies like prompt-only tuning versus full prompt+LM tuning.

- Expanding research on multi-prompt learning methods, including prompt ensembling, prompt augmentation, prompt composition/decomposition, and prompt sharing for multi-task/domain/lingual learning. Many open questions remain about how best to leverage multiple prompts.

- Studying prompt transferability and finding ways to make prompts less tied to specific models. There has been little analysis so far on whether prompts can transfer across models.

- Exploring new pre-training objectives and methods tailored to prompting, rather than just using models developed for the standard pre-train then fine-tune paradigm.

- Developing more theoretical analysis and guarantees for prompting methods. The current theoretical understanding of why prompting works is limited.

- Addressing issues around calibrating uncertainty estimates from language models when used for prompting. The predicted probabilities are often miscalibrated.

So in summary, many open research questions remain around extending prompting approaches to new tasks/scenarios, improving multi-prompt learning, developing tailored pre-training methods, enhancing prompt transferability, and providing theory and calibrated predictions. The authors lay out a detailed research agenda for the field to make prompting methods more effective, generalizable, and interpretable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a systematic survey of prompting methods in natural language processing. Prompting methods aim to make use of language model pre-training by reformulating downstream tasks into a cloze-style format that is similar to the pre-training objective. The key components of prompting methods are prompt engineering, which involves finding effective ways to reformulate the task, and answer engineering, which involves defining an appropriate output space. The paper provides a formal notation for prompting methods, overviews common pre-trained language models used for prompting, and organizes prompting techniques along several axes like prompt shape, search method, and whether tuning is used. It discusses applications of prompting like text classification, summarization, and commonsense reasoning, and analyzes research trends in the field. The paper aims to provide a structured understanding of prompting methods to make this promising paradigm more accessible. Overall, it delivers a comprehensive overview of the foundations, techniques, applications, and open challenges for prompting methods in NLP.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a formalization and survey of prompting methods in natural language processing. Prompting methods use language models to perform prediction tasks by reformulating the original input into a prompt with blanks that the model fills in. The first paragraph summarizes the background. Traditional supervised learning trains a model to predict outputs from inputs. Recently, pre-trained language models have become popular, which are trained on massive unlabeled corpora to predict text, then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Prompting methods allow using these pre-trained models to perform tasks by creating textual prompts with slots for the model to fill in. 

The second paragraph summarizes the technical content. The paper first formally defines prompting, which converts an input to a prompt using a template, searches over candidate answers to fill blanks, then maps the predicted answer to the actual output. The survey categorizes prompting methods along several dimensions: choice of pre-trained model, prompt engineering, answer engineering, expanding the prompting paradigm, and training strategies. It surveys applications of prompting in knowledge probing, text classification, information extraction, reasoning tasks, question answering, text generation, multimodal learning, and meta-applications. Finally, it relates prompting to other paradigms like ensemble learning and few-shot learning, and analyzes the field quantitatively and chronologically.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a template-based named entity recognition method using the pre-trained seq2seq model BART. The key idea is to enumerate all possible text spans in a given sentence as candidate entities and adopt a generate-and-rank framework to generate the type for each span. Specifically, for each text span, the method constructs a cloze-style prompt with the span wrapped in the template (e.g., "[Span] is a [Z] entity"). The [Z] placeholder is where BART generates an entity type token. To enable BART to generate entity types, the method first pre-defines an entity type vocabulary and fine-tunes BART on labeled data to predict entity types. During inference, the method feeds all span prompts to the fine-tuned BART and generates an entity type for each span. The (span, entity type) pairs are further ranked based on the conditional probability of generating the entity type. The top-ranked entity span and type pairs are selected as final outputs. The whole process does not require any feature engineering or external resources. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
