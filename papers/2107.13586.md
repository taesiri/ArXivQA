## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not seem to have a clearly stated central research question or hypothesis. It appears to be a survey paper that provides an overview of prompt-based learning methods in natural language processing. 

The key ideas covered in the paper are:

- Prompt-based learning is an emerging paradigm in NLP where instead of training a model end-to-end on input-output examples, pre-trained language models are adapted to new tasks using prompts and demonstrations. 

- Prompts reformulate the original input into a textual prompt with blanks that the language model can fill in. This allows leveraging knowledge acquired during pre-training.

- The paper formally defines prompt-based learning, discusses design considerations like choice of pre-trained model and prompt engineering, and provides a typology of concepts.

- It summarizes prior work on various aspects of prompting like prompt shape, automated prompt search, multi-prompt learning, and training strategies.

- The applications of prompting methods across NLP tasks like text classification, QA, summarization etc. are discussed.

- Connections to related topics like few-shot learning and challenges in prompt engineering are analyzed.

So in summary, this survey paper aims to provide a structured overview of the prompt-based learning paradigm, its techniques and applications, rather than answering a specific research question. The key hypothesis seems to be that prompting is a promising new direction for effectively utilizing pre-trained language models.

- Conduct more systematic studies to understand the tradeoffs between different parameter tuning strategies for prompts and language models.

- Develop better methods for prompt ensembling, prompt decomposition/composition, and prompt augmentation that alleviate issues like length limits.

- Explore techniques for multi-task, multi-domain, and multi-lingual prompt learning by sharing and interacting prompts across tasks/domains/languages.

- Choose pre-trained language models that are best suited for prompting methods through systematic comparison.

- Develop theoretical understanding and guarantees for prompting methods.

- Improve prompt transferability across different models. 

- Explore synergistic combinations of prompting methods and other paradigms like pre-training objectives tailored for prompting.

- Develop methods to calibrate generation probabilities from language models to ensure good probabilistic predictions when using prompts.

Overall, the authors highlight many interesting open research questions in areas like expanding the applicability of prompting methods, engineering better prompts and answers, theoretical analysis, transferability, and combinations with other methods.

Prompting methods aim to make use of pre-trained language models to perform downstream tasks by reformulating the task into a cloze-style prompt that is filled in by the language model. The key components of prompting methods include the choice of pre-trained model, prompt engineering to create effective prompts, answer engineering to constrain the output space, and training strategies like prompt tuning. The paper provides a unified mathematical notation to describe prompting methods, organizes prior work into a typology, and also includes a meta-analysis of research trends. Overall, the paper gives a comprehensive overview of the emerging research area of prompting methods, which allow language models to perform a variety of NLP tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot setting without explicit fine-tuning for each task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a systematic survey and organization of research works on prompting methods in natural language processing. In contrast to traditional supervised learning which trains a model to predict output y given input x, prompting methods make use of language models pretrained on large amounts of text. To adapt these models to downstream tasks, the input is modified into a textual prompt containing slots to be filled in. The language model can then be used to fill in the slots and make predictions. 

The paper provides a formal definition of prompting methods, covering concepts like prompting functions, prompt templates, and answer searching. It then organizes prompting methods along several key dimensions: choice of pretrained models, prompt engineering techniques, answer engineering techniques, multi-prompt learning methods, and training strategies. The survey also categorizes the variety of NLP applications where prompting has been applied. Finally, it connects prompting to related paradigms in NLP and machine learning, identifies current challenges, and provides a meta-analysis of research trends. Overall, the paper aims to systematically organize knowledge in this emerging research area and make it more accessible to interested researchers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a template-based named entity recognition (NER) method using pre-trained auto-regressive language models. The key idea is to reformulate the NER task as a text generation problem by enumerating text spans in the input sentence and generating their entity labels through prompts. 

Specifically, given an input sentence, the method first enumerates all possible text spans. For each span, two prompts are constructed to determine whether it is an entity mention or not. The prompt contains the original sentence with the target span masked and a cloze question (e.g. "Mike went to [X]. [X] is a \texttt{[Z]} entity."). The language model then fills in the \texttt{[Z]} slot, predicting whether the span is an entity ("person") or not ("none").

By prompting the language model to generate an entity label for each text span separately, this method avoids the difficulty of jointly modeling the sequence labeling nature of NER, and takes advantage of the pre-trained auto-regressive model's strong text generation capability. Experiments show that this prompt-based method achieves competitive results with standard NER models. The main novelty lies in the problem reformulation and the enumeration-and-prompting approach.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper appears to be a survey paper reviewing research on what the authors call "prompt-based learning" in natural language processing (NLP). The key ideas seem to be:

- Traditional NLP has relied on supervised learning, where models are trained to predict outputs y given inputs x. This requires large labeled datasets. 

- An emerging paradigm is to instead pretrain language models (LMs) that predict the probability of text sequences P(x), then use these LMs for downstream tasks by "prompting" them - converting inputs x into textual "prompts" x' with blanks for the model to fill in.

- The prompts allow the pretrained LM to be used for downstream tasks with little or no labeled data, in a "few-shot" or even "zero-shot" manner. This avoids the need for large labeled datasets.

- However, designing effective prompts requires "prompt engineering". The paper reviews methods for manual and automated prompt design.

- The paper also discusses other aspects like strategies for tuning the LM and prompts, applications of prompting, and open challenges.

In summary, the key focus seems to be introducing and providing a structured review of this new "prompt-based learning" paradigm, which allows pre-trained LMs to be effectively adapted to downstream tasks through prompting instead of traditional supervised training. The paper aims to explain the foundations, important concepts, applications, and open problems in this emerging research area.
