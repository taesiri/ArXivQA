# [RealKIE: Five Novel Datasets for Enterprise Key Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing key information extraction benchmarks lack realism in terms of the complexity of practical enterprise data extraction tasks. Specific challenges include:
    - Poor document quality leading to OCR artifacts and text serialization issues
    - Sparse annotations within long documents causing class imbalance
    - Complex table layouts that must be considered to discriminate between labels
    - Varied data types needing extraction, from dates/prices to long clauses

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces RealKIE, a benchmark of 5 challenging document datasets for advancing key information extraction:
    1. SEC S1 Filings - investment analysis of financial docs
    2. US Non-Disclosure Agreements - legal analysis 
    3. UK Charity Reports - audit/diligence analysis
    4. FCC Invoices - accounts payable/receivable
    5. Resource Contracts - legal diligence
- Documents have manual text span annotations indexed to OCR output
- Mimics real-world enterprise extraction tasks and associated challenges

Contributions:
- 5 datasets capturing complexities of real-world extraction tasks, 3 of which are novel contributions
- Detailed annotation process, document processing techniques, and baseline modeling methodology
- Analysis highlighting remaining challenges related to layout, imbalance, context length
- Establishes testbed to drive research into industry-applicable extraction models/methods

The paper introduces a benchmark called RealKIE to stimulate research into key information extraction methods that can handle practical challenges seen in enterprise settings. It provides 5 document datasets with span annotations that exhibit poor quality, sparse labels, complex layouts, and varied data types. Strong baselines are presented, but layout models in particular require more work to succeed on this data. By capturing real-world task complexity, RealKIE aims to push extraction technologies applicable to industry problems.
