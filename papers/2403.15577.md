# [Autonomous Driving With Perception Uncertainties: Deep-Ensemble Based   Adaptive Cruise Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15577)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of developing an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system for autonomous vehicles that utilizes camera sensors to estimate the distance to a lead vehicle. ACC systems aim to track a driver-set speed while maintaining a safe distance to lead vehicles. However, perception uncertainties from camera-based systems can impact downstream decision-making and control, potentially compromising safety. The high-dimensionality of image data and lack of interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) further exacerbates this challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a modularized development approach. First, a Deep Ensemble of DNN regressors is used to estimate the distance headway from RGB images and quantify the uncertainty in this estimate. The Deep Ensemble produces a Gaussian mixture model representing the distribution of the distance headway. Second, a Stochastic Model Predictive Controller (MPC) utilizes the distributional estimate from the Deep Ensemble to optimize the acceleration trajectory of the ego vehicle. The MPC incorporates chance constraints to provide probabilistic guarantees on maintaining a safe distance.

Key Contributions:
- A Deep Ensemble is developed to estimate the distance headway to a lead vehicle from camera images. The ensemble methodology improves robustness, especially for out-of-distribution scenarios.
- A Stochastic MPC controller is formulated to leverage the Deep Ensemble's estimates and uncertainties. The MPC provably maintains safe distance with high probability.
- The integrated ACC system achieved good performance in simulation case studies and tests using a real-world traffic dataset. The system maintained safety while tracking speed and following lead vehicles.
- The ACC system maintained robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios with different weather conditions and vehicle models compared to the training distribution.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of a Deep Ensemble distance estimator with a Stochastic MPC controller to enable safe and robust ACC for autonomous driving using camera sensors. The proposed approach was demonstrated to work well across various conditions.
