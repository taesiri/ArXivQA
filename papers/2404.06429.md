# [Magic-Boost: Boost 3D Generation with Mutli-View Conditioned Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06429)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recently, there has been significant progress in 3D content generation by leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion models. One promising approach involves fine-tuning 2D models to produce multi-view images which are then reconstructed into 3D models. However, the generated 3D assets from such methods still lack intricate textures and complex geometries due to inconsistencies and limited resolution. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes Magic-Boost, a multi-view conditioned diffusion model that significantly refines coarse 3D generative results through brief SDS optimization. Given a coarse 3D model and corresponding synthesized multi-view images (e.g. from Instant3D), Magic-Boost effectively enhances the model by leveraging the multi-view images to provide precise SDS guidance.

Specifically, Magic-Boost:
- Extracts dense local features from multi-view inputs using a U-Net at fixed timestep. 
- Employs self-attention across views to implicitly encode 3D correlations.
- Introduces data augmentations like noise/scale perturbations to improve robustness. 
- Presents an Anchor Iterative Update loss to address SDS over-saturation.

Together, Magic-Boost enriches local detail in geometry/texture of the coarse inputs within 15 minutes, generating high-quality 3D assets.

Main Contributions:
- A multi-view conditioned diffusion model that provides precise SDS guidance for refining coarse 3D generations
- Efficient extraction of dense local features using U-Net at fixed timestep
- Data augmentation strategies to facilitate robust training 
- Anchor Iterative Update loss to alleviate over-saturation in SDS optimization
- Significantly improved 3D asset quality in terms of intricate geometry and authentic textures
