# [ArtAdapter: Text-to-Image Style Transfer using Multi-Level Style Encoder   and Explicit Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02109)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces ArtAdapter, an innovative text-to-image (T2I) style transfer framework that achieves unprecedented fidelity in capturing artistic styles from references images while closely adhering to textual descriptions. At its core is a multi-level style encoder that extracts hierarchical style embeddings combined with an Explicit Adaptation mechanism in the diffusion model backbone to focus adaptation on artistic style. An Auxiliary Content Adapter provides weak guidance on content structure during training to avoid style references dominating content. Additionally, a fast finetuning approach allows for nuanced style refinements. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate ArtAdapterâ€™s superior performance over other methods in accurately transferring styles ranging from delicate details to high-level composition while preventing style references' content from overriding textual semantics. The method also allows flexible balancing of style versus text alignment and creative mixing of styles. Through its technical innovations, ArtAdapter sets a new standard for text-guided image generation that faithfully renders stylistic expression.
