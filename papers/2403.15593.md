# [FairerCLIP: Debiasing CLIP's Zero-Shot Predictions using Functions in   RKHSs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15593)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP can propagate or amplify societal biases present in the training data and also learn to rely on spurious correlations instead of meaningful features. 
- Existing debiasing methods for CLIP are limited in:
    - Type of bias handled: Most only handle spurious correlations, not intrinsic dependencies between attributes
    - Labels needed for training: Some require ground-truth labels, others don't, but no single method works in both cases
    - Efficiency: Some have slow convergence during training leading to high latency

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FairerCLIP, a general debiasing approach applicable to both intrinsic dependencies and spurious correlations. 
- It can learn with or without ground-truth labels through an iterative refining of pseudo-labels.
- The debiasing problem is formulated in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) using a statistical dependence measure that captures all types of correlations between representations and attributes.
- This lends itself to an alternating optimization with closed-form solutions per step, enabling faster convergence.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates a single general method can outperform prior specialized baselines in handling both intrinsic dependencies and spurious correlations, and in learning with or without labels
- Shows kernel methods are effective for competing debiasing objectives on frozen CLIP backbones; enjoy closed-form solutions for faster training, scale reasonably to medium-sized datasets, and work better in low data regimes
- Empirically demonstrates appreciable accuracy gains over baselines on benchmark fairness and spurious correlation datasets

In summary, the paper proposes a flexible, efficient and high-performing approach to debias frozen CLIP models by formulating the problem in RKHSs and using an alternating optimization strategy. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate its advantages.
