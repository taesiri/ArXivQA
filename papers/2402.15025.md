# [Practice Makes Perfect: Planning to Learn Skill Parameter Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers a robot equipped with a library of parameterized skills that can be sequenced to accomplish long-horizon tasks. Initially, the robot only has general prior distributions over the skill parameters. The key problem is how should the robot improve its parameter selection policies through autonomous experience so that it gets better at solving human-provided tasks over time. This is framed as an embodied active learning problem.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes that the robot should spend its free time planning to actively practice skills. The core idea is to repeatedly: (1) select a skill, (2) plan to satisfy preconditions for that skill, (3) practice the skill using an explore parameter distribution, (4) update the parameter policy with the practice data. The key novelty is in how skills are selected for practice. 

The proposed approach ("Estimate, Extrapolate & Situate") selects skills according to how much the overall task success rate would improve if that skill's competence improved. This involves (1) estimating current skill competence from data, (2) predicting how much competence would improve with additional practice ("extrapolating"), and (3) determining how overall task success rates would change given the competence improvement ("situate"). This connects practice directly to task performance gains.

Contributions:
- Formalizes the problem of active skill practice for improving task performance in robotic systems with prior knowledge and learning capabilities.
- Proposes the "planning to practice" strategy and specifically the Estimate, Extrapolate & Situate (EES) method for skill selection.
- Empirically demonstrates in simulation and real-robot experiments that EES enables efficient improvements in task success rates compared to alternatives.
- Shows real-robot learning and task improvement in two long-horizon mobile manipulation domains using a Spot robot.

The key insight is that practice should be directed toward skill competence improvements that would most benefit overall task success rates, not just improving the lowest performing skills. By estimating, extrapolating and situating skill competence improvements, the proposed approach makes practice directly task-relevant.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Estimate, Extrapolate and Situate (EES) for a robot to autonomously decide which parameterized skills to actively practice during free time in order to most efficiently improve performance on human-provided long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in the real world.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called "Estimate, Extrapolate & Situate (EES)" for a robot to autonomously decide which skills to practice during its free time in order to maximize improvements in accomplishing human-given tasks. Specifically, EES involves:

1) Estimating the current competence of each skill based on past outcomes

2) Extrapolating how much the competence would improve if the skill was practiced again and its parameter policy updated 

3) Situating the extrapolated competence improvement in the distribution of human-given tasks to select the skill whose practice would most improve overall human task success rates

The key ideas are to avoid practicing skills that are impossible to improve or irrelevant to tasks, and instead focus practice on skills whose improvement would most benefit performance on the task distribution. Experiments in simulation and on a real robot demonstrate that EES enables more efficient learning of skill parameter policies compared to other baseline strategies.

In summary, the main contribution is the EES method for active practice of skills that is situated in and directed towards improving performance on human-given long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Parameterized skills - Skills that have continuous parameters that can be set, such as grasp location, sweeping velocity, etc. Learning to set these parameters is a key focus.

- Parameter policy learning - Learning policies that select good parameters for skills based on the state. 

- Planning - Using symbolic planning techniques to sequence skills to accomplish goals.

- Competence - The probability of a skill succeeding from an applicable state. Estimating and extrapolating competence is important. 

- Embodied active learning - The problem of an agent autonomously and sequentially deciding how to gather data to improve its performance on external tasks.

- Estimate, Extrapolate & Situate (EES) - The proposed 3-step approach to selecting skills to practice. Estimates current competence, extrapolates how competence would improve, and evaluates impact on task performance.

- Reset-free online learning - Paradigm where the agent alternates between solving given tasks and taking actions to learn, without environment resets.

- Long-horizon mobile manipulation - Challenge problem domain involving sequencing many skills with a mobile manipulator to accomplish tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a 3-step process of estimating, extrapolating, and situating skill competence. What are the key advantages of each step? How do they build on each other to enable more effective skill selection?

2. The competence estimation method uses a Bayesian time series model with cycle priors and an observation model. Walk through the details of this model. What are the benefits of taking a probabilistic, temporal approach here? How does it improve over simpler regression or classification models?

3. The competence extrapolation step predicts how competence would change after one additional practice. This requires making assumptions about the relationship between practice and competence improvement. What assumption does the method make here and why? How could this assumption be relaxed or improved upon? 

4. Situating the competence requires aggregating over an empirical distribution of previously seen tasks. What are the limitations of using the empirical distribution here versus the true (but unknown) task distribution? Could there be failure cases where this leads the method astray?

5. The method relies on access to symbolic planning operators and the ability to plan. How does leveraging the relationship to AI planning impact the overall approach? What limitations does this introduce and how might they be addressed?

6. Assumption 1 in the paper requires that all skills are reachable through some sequence of actions. What are the implications of this assumption in the lifelong, reset-free setting? How could the approach be extended to relax this assumption?

7. The exploration strategy for selecting skill parameters is epsilon-greedy. What are other possibilities here and how might they impact the overall method? Are there any particularly good matches between certain exploration strategies and the competence-focused skill selection?

8. How does the method address and handle noise, error, and uncertainty - both in the real world experiments and the simulation experiments? What types of failures occur and how does the system cope? What further improvements could make the system more robust?

9. The comparison to MAPLE-Q highlights challenges in directly comparing to deep RL methods. What modifications were made to MAPLE-Q to make the comparison more fair? Even with these changes, what underlying differences make the comparison difficult?

10. The method relies heavily on manually engineered components, such as predicates, operators, and feature engineering. How could these be learned instead? Why was it still effective to manually specify them? What tradeoffs are being made with this choice?
