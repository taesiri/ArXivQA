# [FORML: A Riemannian Hessian-free Method for Meta-learning with   Orthogonality Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18605)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many machine learning problems like PCA, ICA, neural networks etc involve optimizing parameters with nonlinear constraints. Modeling constraints as optimizations on Riemannian manifolds is a popular approach. 
- However, meta-learning approaches that aim to learn the optimization process itself are computationally very expensive on Riemannian manifolds. This is because computing gradients requires backward propagation through manifold operations like retraction and orthogonal projection.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Hessian-free meta-learning approach called First Order Riemannian Meta-Learning (FORML) that uses a first-order approximation to compute gradients instead of propagating through the optimization path. 

- Specifically, FORML performs gradient descent both in the inner loop (to adapt to individual tasks) and outer loop (to update meta-parameters) on the Riemannian manifold. 

- To compute outer loop gradients, instead of differentiating through the entire inner loop optimization, the gradient of the final inner loop update step is directly used. This avoids expensive second-order derivatives.

- Theoretical derivation of this first-order approximation is provided for the Stiefel manifold case.

Contributions:
- Proposes a efficient way to perform meta-learning on Riemannian manifolds by avoiding expensive second-order derivatives.

- Provides theoretical analysis and derivation of the first-order approximation for the Stiefel manifold case.

- Empirically evaluates FORML on few-shot image classification tasks and shows improvements over baseline MAML and other meta-learning methods.

- Overall, enables extending meta-learning approaches to problems with Riemannian constraints in an efficient and scalable manner.
