# [CV 3315 Is All You Need : Semantic Segmentation Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12571)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus seems to be evaluating and comparing different semantic segmentation methods, with a goal of finding an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency for a road scene segmentation task. Specifically, the key aspects appear to be:- Reviewing existing semantic segmentation approaches, including CNN-based (ResNet, UNet, DeeplabV3Plus) and transformer-based (SegFormer) models. - Analyzing the pros and cons of these methods in terms of capability for spatial information extraction, edge reconstruction, lightweight designs, and global relations establishment.- Conducting experiments on the SegFormer architecture to explore the performance vs efficiency trade-off across different model sizes (B0, B2, B5).- Applying useful training and evaluation tricks like transfer learning, learning rate scheduling, class balanced loss, online hard example mining, and multi-scale testing to further optimize SegFormer. - Comparing results to select the best candidate model for the road scene segmentation task, considering accuracy, computational efficiency, and other factors.So in summary, the key hypothesis seems to be that transformer-based SegFormer models can achieve an optimal balance between high segmentation accuracy and efficiency for this application, if properly optimized. The experiments aim to validate this and determine the best specific SegFormer configuration.
