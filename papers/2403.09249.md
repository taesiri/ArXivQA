# [Leveraging Constraint Programming in a Deep Learning Approach for   Dynamically Solving the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on solving the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) in real-time. The FJSSP involves scheduling operations across machines while optimizing objectives like minimizing makespan. It is an NP-hard problem. Recent approaches rely on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) but have limitations - inability to leverage existing techniques like constraint programming (CP) optimally for smaller instances, and extensive exploration hampering performance.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a hybrid approach combining the strengths of CP and deep learning. It involves:

1) Training a heterogeneous graph neural network via behavioral cloning using optimal solutions generated by CP. This eliminates the need for exploration in DRL, enhances sample efficiency, and performance.

2) Introducing a CP capability predictor using supervised learning to assess if CP can solve an instance in real-time. 

3) Jointly generating solutions - using the trained model for initial complex stages, then switching to CP once the instance is simplified enough as predicted by the capability predictor.

Main Contributions:

- A new training methodology for scheduling problems using optimal CP solutions  
- CP capability predictor to identify when to transition between methods
- Novel joint construction of solutions combining deep learning and CP
- Extensive evaluation showing superior performance over 5 state-of-the-art DRL methods and a CP solver
- Demonstrates promise for application to other combinatorial optimization problems via experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem

The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of deep learning and CP to effectively solve the FJSSP in real-time, outperforming existing methods. The principles explored can enable better hybrid techniques for combinatorial optimization.
