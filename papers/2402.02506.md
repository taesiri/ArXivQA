# [Device Scheduling and Assignment in Hierarchical Federated Learning for   Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02506)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) is proposed to alleviate the scalability issue of traditional Federated Learning (FL) when accommodating a massive number of IoT devices. In HFL, multiple edge servers are introduced to distribute the workload of model aggregation. However, HFL still suffers from high communication and computation overheads when all devices participate in training. Besides, existing HFL systems lack effective device scheduling and assignment methods. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an HFL framework containing:
1) An improved K-Center (IKC) algorithm for device scheduling. IKC schedules a subset of devices at each global iteration to approximate an IID dataset for training. This accelerates the convergence of HFL. 
2) A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach for device-to-edge assignment. The DRL agent assigns devices to edges quickly while balancing workloads across edges.  
3) Resource allocation conducted within each edge server to optimize bandwidth and CPU frequency allocation.

Main Contributions:
1) Formulation of a joint communication and computation optimization problem for HFL training cost minimization.
2) Proposal of IKC for scheduling devices from different distributions to construct an approximately IID dataset for efficient HFL training.
3) Design of a DRL-based device assignment method using dueling double deep Q-network (D$^3$QN). D$^3$QN achieves comparable performance to benchmarks but with lower latency.
4) Extensive experiments on FashionMNIST & CIFAR10 showing the proposed framework reduces HFL's training cost by 50-70% compared to no device scheduling.

In summary, the paper provides an HFL optimization framework with scheduling, assignment and resource allocation methods to significantly improve efficiency. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

 According to the paper, the main contributions are summarized as follows:

1. It formulates a joint communication and computation optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of time delay and energy consumption for training the entire hierarchical federated learning (HFL) algorithm in an Internet of Things (IoT) system. 

2. It proposes an improved K-Center (IKC) algorithm to deal with the device scheduling problem in HFL. The IKC algorithm enables selecting only a fraction of IoT devices for model training while ensuring learning efficiency.

3. It introduces a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach to tackle the device assignment problem in HFL. The DRL model performs comparably to the existing device assignment approach while achieving a faster assignment process. 

4. It adopts convex optimization tools to perform resource allocation for each edge server after device scheduling and assignment.

5. It conducts extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed HFL framework significantly reduces the system cost compared to baseline methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an improved K-Center (IKC) algorithm for device scheduling in hierarchical federated learning (HFL). How exactly does IKC address the issues of high overhead and repetitive device selection compared to the vanilla K-Center (VKC) approach?

2. In formulating the optimization problem for HFL, what is the rationale behind minimizing the weighted sum of time delay and energy consumption? How does this objective capture the key practical concerns in HFL system design?

3. The paper decomposes the optimization problem into three sub-problems - device scheduling, device assignment, and resource allocation. Why is this decomposition an effective strategy? What are the interactions between these three sub-problems?  

4. For the DRL-based device assignment method, how exactly is the state space designed to capture the relevant information for making each assignment decision? Why are bidirectional LSTM networks well-suited for this problem?

5. What are the key considerations in designing the reward function for the DRL device assignment method? How does the choice of reward function incentivize the DRL agent to make decisions comparable to the benchmark HFEL method?

6. How do the comparisons between IKC scheduling and VKC scheduling isolate the impact of addressing non-IID data in HFL systems? What aspects of performance gains can be directly attributed to IKC's ability to handle non-IID data better?

7. For what types of HFL application scenarios would scheduling only 30% of devices be recommended over 50%? What are the tradeoffs involved in this choice regarding model accuracy, time delay, energy use, etc.?

8. How could the modular design of the overall HFL framework proposed in this paper help facilitate practical deployment? What components could be changed or customized for different applications?

9. Could the IKC scheduling method be applied to traditional federated learning systems with a single centralized server? Would any modifications need to be made?
