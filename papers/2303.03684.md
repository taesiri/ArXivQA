# [MOSO: Decomposing MOtion, Scene and Object for Video Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03684)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a two-stage motion, scene and object decomposition framework (MOSO) for video prediction. - The main hypothesis is that decomposing videos into motion, scene, and object components and modeling them separately can improve video prediction performance. - In the first stage, MOSO-VQVAE decomposes a video into motion, scene, and object components and encodes them into discrete tokens. - In the second stage, MOSO-Transformer generates future video frames by first predicting scene and object tokens, then generating motion tokens conditioned on the predicted scene/object tokens.- The key intuition is that modeling scenes, objects, and motions separately allows handling their different characteristics and patterns, leading to better video prediction. - Experiments show state-of-the-art results on several video prediction benchmarks, supporting the hypothesis that decomposing videos into semantic components improves video prediction.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly decomposing videos into motion, scene, and object and modeling them separately improves video prediction performance compared to modeling videos directly as a whole. The experiments support this hypothesis.
