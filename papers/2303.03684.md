# [MOSO: Decomposing MOtion, Scene and Object for Video Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03684)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes a two-stage motion, scene and object decomposition framework (MOSO) for video prediction. - The main hypothesis is that decomposing videos into motion, scene, and object components and modeling them separately can improve video prediction performance. - In the first stage, MOSO-VQVAE decomposes a video into motion, scene, and object components and encodes them into discrete tokens. - In the second stage, MOSO-Transformer generates future video frames by first predicting scene and object tokens, then generating motion tokens conditioned on the predicted scene/object tokens.- The key intuition is that modeling scenes, objects, and motions separately allows handling their different characteristics and patterns, leading to better video prediction. - Experiments show state-of-the-art results on several video prediction benchmarks, supporting the hypothesis that decomposing videos into semantic components improves video prediction.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly decomposing videos into motion, scene, and object and modeling them separately improves video prediction performance compared to modeling videos directly as a whole. The experiments support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

According to my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel two-stage framework MOSO (MOtion, Scene and Object) for video prediction. The key idea is to decompose videos into motion, scene, and object components and conduct video prediction at the token level.2. It develops MOSO-VQVAE in the first stage to learn the video decomposition and encoding. Specifically, it uses separate encoders to encode motion, scene, and object video components into discrete tokens. It also develops a time-independent decoder that can flexibly visualize and manipulate the decomposed components. 3. It proposes MOSO-Transformer in the second stage to conduct video prediction at the token level. It first predicts scene and object tokens, then generates motion tokens conditioned on the predicted scene/object tokens. By modeling videos at the token level, it avoids manipulating individual pixels.4. Extensive experiments show MOSO achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging video prediction benchmarks. It also demonstrates strong performance on unconditional video generation and video interpolation tasks.5. MOSO provides an intuitive and effective way to decompose and manipulate video components. The decomposition also helps model distinct motion patterns and maintain clear object identities in video prediction. The token-level modeling further reduces the complexity and enables long-term video generation.In summary, the key innovation is the motion/scene/object decomposition framework for token-level video prediction and generation. Both the decomposition strategy and token-level modeling contribute to the superior performance and manipulation ability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage framework called MOSO for video prediction that decomposes videos into motion, scene, and object components, encodes them into discrete tokens, and then predicts future video tokens by first generating the scene and object tokens and then predicting motion tokens conditioned on them.
