# [ACCESS: Prompt Engineering for Automated Web Accessibility Violation   Corrections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16450)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Despite laws and guidelines like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), over 90% of websites still fail to meet accessibility requirements for people with disabilities. Fixing violations manually is expensive, time-consuming and error-prone. Prior work has focused on automatically detecting violations, but not correcting them. There is a need for tools that can automatically fix accessibility errors to create more inclusive web experiences.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents a novel approach to automatically correct accessibility violations in website DOM using foundation models. It introduces ACCESS, a benchmark to evaluate violation corrections. It leverages large language models (LLMs) like GPT and prompt engineering to generate fixes for violations extracted from the DOM. An "ACCESS Agent" implements the corrections by modifying the DOM elements.  

The paper collects violations for 25 URLs using Playwright tests. It assigns severity scores to violations and computes aggregate scores per URL. Prompts are constructed using techniques like few-shot learning and ReAct which guide the LLM to output corrected HTML. The agent replaces incorrect HTML with LLM suggestions in the DOM. Improvements are evaluated by re-running Playwright and comparing initial and final severity scores.

Main Contributions:
- First general benchmark (ACCESS) to evaluate automatic accessibility violation corrections 
- Novel approach using LLMs and prompt engineering to automatically modify DOM to fix violations
- Accessibility corrections directly in the DOM instead of just detecting errors
- Quantitative analysis showing over 50% decrease in violation severity scores after applying corrections
- Demonstrates improvements in web accessibility without expensive manual effort
- Sets path for future work on automating accessibility for inclusive web experiences

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the high-level solution and techniques used, the novel contributions made over prior approaches, the quantitative results achieved, and the potential impact on promoting web accessibility and inclusion.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel approach to automatically correcting web accessibility violations by modifying the document object model (DOM) in real time using foundation models and prompt engineering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of an automated system to correct web accessibility violations using large language models and prompt engineering techniques. Specifically:

- The authors created a novel benchmark called ACCESS to evaluate the performance of models in reducing accessibility violation errors. This involves assigning numerical severity scores to violations and comparing scores before and after corrections. 

- They collected a dataset of website URLs and used the Playwright API to identify accessibility violations. This dataset was used to generate prompts to feed into LLMs.

- They developed a system called ACCESS Agent that takes the violation data, generates prompts using techniques like React and few-shot learning, feeds the prompts to LLMs like GPT-3.5 to get suggested corrections, and implements the corrections by modifying the DOM of websites.

- Through prompt engineering, they achieved over 50% reduction in accessibility violation errors across their dataset. The React prompting approach with reasoning and validation performed the best.

In summary, the key contribution is using LLMs and prompt engineering for the first time to automatically correct accessibility violations in website DOM, with significant reduction in errors. This lays the groundwork for developing real-world tools to enhance web accessibility.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a semi-automatic approach to correcting web accessibility violations. How does this approach balance the efficiency of automation with the accuracy of human input? What specific prompt engineering techniques are used to achieve this balance?

2. The paper introduces a new benchmark called ACCESS for evaluating accessibility violation correction. What metrics does this benchmark use to quantify severity of violations and performance of correction models? How was the weighting system devised for the different impact categories? 

3. The ReAct prompting method performed the best out of the prompting techniques tested. What aspects of ReAct prompting enable it to reduce hallucinations and adapt to different environments? How does it accomplish effective reasoning and action blending?

4. The paper found higher success rates in correcting certain textual violation types compared to visual ones. What underlying limitations of current LLMs does this highlight? How can future research address these limitations?

5. Region errors made up the highest percentage of violations in the dataset. What makes these errors particularly complex for LLMs to correct automatically? Would incorporating the entire DOM as input help address ARIA errors more effectively?

6. How was the dataset of website URLs constructed? What proportion of sites had fewer vs higher numbers of violations? What implications does this have for future data collection?

7. The paper categorizes the websites in the dataset by type (shopping, government etc). Do certain categories typically have more accessibility issues? Should future work focus on collecting data from certain website types? 

8. The results show GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in a baseline test. What aspects of GPT-4 enable this, and why could only a smaller dataset be tested for GPT-4?

9. What are some real-world applications and implications of an automated accessibility violation correction tool? Who would benefit from its adoption and how?

10. What directions for future work does the paper suggest, such as enhancing the diversity and size of the violations dataset? How could deep learning techniques augment capabilities further?
