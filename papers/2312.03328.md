# [Deep Learning for Koopman-based Dynamic Movement Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03328)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for learning robotic motions from demonstrations by combining dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) and Koopman operator theory. Specifically, the authors develop an autoencoder dynamic mode decomposition (aDMD) framework that projects nonlinear dynamical systems into linear latent spaces so that solutions reproduce desired complex motions. The autoencoder enables generalizability and scalability to new motions, while the linear latent space provides interpretability. They validate their approach on the LASA handwriting dataset, showing performance comparable to extended DMD but with far fewer training examples of each letter. A key advantage is that their method only requires one example trajectory per motion, and can generalize to new motions not seen during training without retraining. The autoencoder compression also makes this method promising for application to high-dimensional robotic systems. Overall, this work provides an important step toward enabling robots to efficiently and robustly learn a wide repertoire of dynamic skills from limited demonstrations.
