# [Beyond Static Evaluation: A Dynamic Approach to Assessing AI Assistants'   API Invocation Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11128)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evaluating AI assistants' ability to invoke APIs have limitations. Static evaluations using pre-defined dialogs can be misleading as they don't capture real-time interactions. Manual evaluations with real humans are accurate but resource intensive. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called Automated Dynamic Evaluation (AutoDE) to evaluate API invocation capabilities without human involvement. 
- AutoDE uses a user agent module based on a large language model (LLM) that is designed to emulate human patterns and interactions. The user agent follows a user script to guide dialogs.
- AutoDE aims to uncover issues overlooked in static evaluations and align closely with manual human evaluations.

Key Contributions:
- A practical dynamic evaluation framework (AutoDE) that achieves high correlation with human evaluations for assessing API mastery.
- Creation of an API invocation benchmark and evaluation of commercial/open-source assistants on it. 
- Analysis of issues in API invocation that are exposed through dynamic but not static evaluations. For example, reluctance to invoke APIs, illusory parameter queries.
- Demonstration that AutoDE identifies strengths/weaknesses invisible in static analyses. When using the Llama 2.7B Chat system as the user agent, AutoDE attained 0.99 consistency with human annotation in assessing four AI assistants.

In summary, the paper presents AutoDE as an automated substitute for expensive human assessment that can uncover deficiencies in an assistant's API mastery through simulated interactions. Experiments highlight its closer alignment to human evaluation compared to conventional static methods.
