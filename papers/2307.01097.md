# [MVDiffusion: Enabling Holistic Multi-view Image Generation with   Correspondence-Aware Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01097)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we enable holistic multi-view image generation with correspondence-aware diffusion?The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:1. Proposing MVDiffusion, a multi-view image generation architecture based on a latent diffusion model pretrained on perspective images, that can simultaneously generate consistent multiple images. 2. Inserting correspondence-aware attention (CAA) blocks into the diffusion model's UNet to enforce consistency across views based on pixel-to-pixel correspondences.3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of MVDiffusion on two multi-view image generation tasks:- Generating high-resolution panoramic images from text prompts, with the capability to extrapolate a full 360Â° view from a single perspective.- Generating multi-view images conditioned on depths and poses, for texturing a scene mesh.4. Proposing a new metric to quantify multi-view consistency of generated images based on PSNR computed over overlapping regions.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by incorporating correspondence awareness into a diffusion model through the proposed CAA blocks, they can enable holistic and consistent multi-view image generation, which they demonstrate through state-of-the-art results on two tasks. The key novelty is using the CAA mechanism for cross-view interactions and consistency in a diffusion model framework.
