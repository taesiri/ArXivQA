# [From Discrete to Continuous: Deep Fair Clustering With Transferable   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16201)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "From Discrete to Continuous: Deep Fair Clustering With Transferable Representations":

Problem:
- Existing deep fair clustering methods assume sensitive attributes are discrete (e.g. gender, race) and do not work for continuous attributes (e.g. proportion of a gender). However, continuous attributes are common in real-world data.
- Current methods achieve fair clustering by minimizing dependence between clustering outputs and sensitive attributes. But the transferability of the learned representations to other downstream tasks is ignored. Also, imposing fairness at the output level does not guarantee fairness when representations are transferred.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a flexible deep fair clustering method that handles both discrete and continuous sensitive attributes by modeling fairness as a mutual information optimization problem.
- Impose fairness at the representation level by minimizing mutual information between representations and sensitive attributes. Show theoretically this guarantees fairness for downstream tasks. 
- Design clustering-friendly objective function to learn representations that have high utility for unseen tasks.

Main Contributions:
- First fair clustering method that handles both discrete and continuous sensitive attributes in a unified framework.
- Investigate for the first time transferability of representations learned from fair clustering to other tasks. Impose fairness at representation level to ensure fairness of transferred tasks.
- Experimental results on datasets with discrete and continuous attributes demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art fair clustering methods.
- Validate transferability by showing representations learned improve performance and fairness on few-shot classification tasks.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel deep fair clustering approach that is flexible to handle different types of sensitive attributes and learns representations that are both fair and transferable to unseen downstream tasks.
