# [Homomorphism Counts for Graph Neural Networks: All About That Basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08595)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have limited expressive power, especially when it comes to counting graph patterns like cycles. This limits their ability to learn functions that rely on counting such patterns.

- Two main approaches aim to address this: 1) Enrich graphs with subgraph counts, 2) Enrich graphs with homomorphism counts. But it's unclear how these compare in terms of expressiveness gain.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a more fine-grained approach that incorporates homomorphism counts of all structures in the "basis" of the target pattern. This basis consists of all possible contractions of the pattern graph.

- Show theoretically and empirically that this provides strictly more expressiveness without additional computational overhead compared to existing approaches.

Main Contributions:

- Prove that using the homomorphism basis is more expressive than using the target parameter itself, for both node-level and graph-level counts (Theorem 1).

- Show the approach is as efficient as subgraph counting, which is the most efficient known way to compute many useful graph parameters (Section 3.2).

- Demonstrate the framework avoids redundant information, works for node-level counts, and goes beyond fixed patterns to properties like graphlets or logical specifications (Sections 3.3-3.5).

- Validate improved expressiveness on benchmarks and show significant performance gains over baseline GNNs on real-world regression and link prediction tasks (Section 4).

Overall, the paper strengthens connections between graph theory and GNNs, and provides a targeted way to inject information to boost model expressiveness and performance. The flexibility of the framework enables diverse future applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes injecting the homomorphism counts of all graphs in the "basis" of a target graph parameter into graph neural networks as features, arguing it is more expressive and efficient than just using the parameter itself or subgraph counts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Studying the expressivity of graph neural networks (GNNs) with respect to injecting graph motif parameters, and showing that injecting the homomorphism basis of a parameter is more expressive than injecting the parameter itself. This applies even for higher-order GNNs.

2. Showing additional benefits of the proposed approach, such as naturally avoiding redundant information and applying at both graph- and node-levels.

3. Providing a flexible framework that goes beyond fixed pattern counting as in previous work, allowing the injection of information like graphlet counts or logical properties.

4. Empirically validating the theoretical findings on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating state of the art expressivity results and significant improvements on real-world regression and link prediction tasks compared to prior approaches.

Overall, the key contribution is a theoretically-grounded and empirically verified approach for increasing the expressive power of GNNs through a fine-grained injection of homomorphism basis counts, with a variety of benefits over prior techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Graph neural networks (GNNs)
- Expressive power of GNNs 
- Homomorphism counting
- Graph motif parameters
- Subgraph counting
- Homomorphism basis
- Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) 
- 1-dimensional Weisfeiler Leman graph isomorphism test (1-WL)
- Subgraph GNNs
- Node-level subgraph information
- Graph-level homomorphism information

The paper discusses limitations of standard GNN architectures like MPNNs in terms of their ability to count certain graph patterns like cycles. It argues for incorporating homomorphism counts of the "basis" structures of target patterns as node or graph-level features to enhance model expressivity. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that using the homomorphism basis subsumes and is more expressive than prior methods of injecting subgraph or raw homomorphism counts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does computing the homomorphism basis of a graph motif parameter compare in computational complexity to directly computing the parameter itself? Does using the homomorphism basis provide any computational benefits?

2) The paper argues that providing a GNN with the homomorphism basis of a graph motif parameter is more expressive than providing just the parameter itself. Can you explain the intuition behind why this is the case?

3) The homomorphism basis approach is shown to avoid redundant information compared to just providing subgraph or homomorphism counts directly. What specific properties of homomorphisms make this avoidance of redundancy possible?

4) How does the concept of the homomorphism basis extend to providing localized, node-level subgraph information? Explain the connection shown in the paper between anchored graph quotients and node-level subgraph counts.

5) Beyond subgraph counting, what other kinds of graph properties or parameters can the homomorphism basis approach be applied to? What examples are discussed in the paper?

6) What assumptions need to be made about a GNN architecture in order for the strict expressiveness gains from using the homomorphism basis to hold? When do these assumptions not necessarily apply?

7) The paper empirically evaluates the homomorphism basis approach on a variety of datasets and tasks. Can you summarize some of the key results and how they validate the theoretical claims made in the paper?

8) What open questions remain regarding the optimal choice of basis to provide as features to a GNN for a given task or domain? What analyses would help provide more understanding here?  

9) How does the concept of graph treewidth relate to the ability of GNN architectures to express certain homomorphism counts? What are the practical implications of this connection?

10) The paper focuses on undirected graphs. What changes or additional considerations need to be made to apply the homomorphism basis framework to directed graph domains?
