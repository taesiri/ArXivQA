# [Adversarially Masked Video Consistency for Unsupervised Domain   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies unsupervised domain adaptation for egocentric action recognition. Existing benchmarks like Epic-Kitchen have small domain gaps between different kitchen environments. To enable more challenging evaluation, the authors propose a new benchmark called U-Ego4D using videos from different regions in the large-scale Ego4D dataset. Bridging the domain gap is difficult due to various shift factors like backgrounds, viewpoints and motion. Current methods perform alignment using full input views which can lead to trivial solutions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a transformer-based model with two novel components - Generative Adversarial Domain Alignment Network (GADAN) and Masked Consistency Learning (MCL). 

GADAN contains an adversarial mask generator and a domain-invariant encoder. The generator produces masks to maximize domain discrepancy of masked source and target features. The encoder is trained to minimize this discrepancy. This avoids trivial solutions by alignment in masked space.

MCL enforces prediction consistency between masked and full target views to improve discrimination. Pseudo-labels of full views are used due to unavailability of target labels.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of a new more challenging benchmark U-Ego4D for video domain adaptation using different regions of Ego4D dataset

- A transformer-based model containing two novel components - GADAN and MCL - to utilize masked views for effective domain alignment and discrimination

- State-of-the-art performance on Epic-Kitchen and the proposed U-Ego4D benchmark
