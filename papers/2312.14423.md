# [Efficacy of Machine-Generated Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large instruction-tuned language models (fine-tuned to respond to instructions) have demonstrated impressive ability to generalize to new tasks zero-shot. However, they rely heavily on limited human-written instruction data, hindering their generality.

Proposed Solution: 
- Conduct quantitative study to analyze the efficacy of machine-generated annotations for fine-tuning compared to human annotations.
- Generate synthetic labels using GPT-3 for text classification and question answering tasks. 
- Fine-tune BERT using human annotations and GPT-generated annotations separately.
- Compare model performance on human versus machine-generated annotations.

Key Contributions:
- Generated synthetic annotations for classification and QA using GPT-3 with 78.54% label accuracy.
- Fine-tuned model achieved 96.01% performance on GPT labels relative to human labels for classification. 
- For classification, model performance with GPT labels was 79.5% vs 82.8% for human labels.
- For QA, model performance dropped significantly with GPT labels (33.6% accuracy) versus human labels (48.99% accuracy).
- Show machine-generated annotations are effective for simpler classification but limitations exist for complex QA task.
- Demonstrate annotations from language models can substantially reduce resource overhead for fine-tuning.

In summary, they quantitatively evaluate efficacy of machine-generated annotations for fine-tuning models, demonstrating promise for reducing human effort while maintaining strong performance on classification. More work needed for complex QA tasks.
