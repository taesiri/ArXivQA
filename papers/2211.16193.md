# [In-Hand 3D Object Scanning from an RGB Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16193)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is how to reconstruct the 3D shape and appearance of an unknown object from an RGB video sequence captured while the object is being manipulated by hands. Specifically, the paper focuses on the challenging problem of simultaneous 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, where estimating both the shape of the object and the camera pose trajectory is difficult without proper initialization. The key hypotheses/claims of the paper are:- Standard Structure-from-Motion methods like COLMAP fail on in-hand scanning of objects due to lack of distinct textures and features in all regions of the object. They can only provide reliable camera poses for highly textured objects.- Simultaneous 3D reconstruction and pose estimation by neural rendering methods like NeRF are prone to failure/divergence without proper pose initialization.- Splitting the video into segments and reconstructing object parts within each segment can provide better pose initialization for a global reconstruction.- A regularization loss can help avoid degenerate shapes and stabilize the optimization when shape is underconstrained due to fewer views.- Rendered depths from previous estimates can help constrain the shape from undergoing large deviations.The paper aims to demonstrate a robust reconstruction and pose estimation method for in-hand scanning that does not rely on textures, works for arbitrary objects, and does not need pose supervision or prior training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for in-hand 3D object scanning from an RGB image sequence. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a method that can reconstruct both textured and poorly textured objects from an RGB video of the object being manipulated, without requiring any prior object knowledge or ground truth poses.- Handling the challenges of simultaneous tracking and reconstruction, which is prone to drift, by splitting the input sequence into overlapping segments. Tracking and reconstruction is done independently on each segment, allowing incremental reconstruction of different object surfaces. The segments are then merged for full reconstruction.- Introducing a shape regularization loss to avoid degenerate shapes during early optimization when constraints are limited. Also using a synthetic depth loss to stabilize tracking against drift.- Achieving camera pose estimation without reliance on texture features like COLMAP by combining both geometric and texture information during tracking. This enables reconstruction of textureless objects.- Demonstrating results on real datasets including handheld captures and achieving better reconstructions than COLMAP, and comparable results to methods that use ground truth poses.In summary, the key contribution is a practical RGB-based reconstruction method for in-hand scanning that can handle both textured and textureless objects through a tracking-based approach and suitable regularization strategies. The method does not require any pose initialization or object priors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method for reconstructing the 3D shape and appearance of an unknown object being manipulated by hands from an RGB video sequence, by representing the object with implicit neural fields, splitting the sequence into segments to enable incremental tracking and reconstruction, and aligning the per-segment reconstructions into a complete model.The key ideas are using implicit neural fields to represent object shape and appearance, splitting the sequence to enable incremental tracking, and aligning per-segment reconstructions.

Experiments on in-hand object datasets demonstrate that the approach can reconstruct both textured and textureless objects.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper presents a method for reconstructing the 3D shape and appearance of an unknown object from an RGB video showing the object being manipulated by hands. This is an interesting and challenging problem in the field of 3D reconstruction and vision-based tracking. - Most prior work on 3D reconstruction relies on multi-view images with known camera poses. This paper tackles the more difficult setting where camera poses are unknown and must be jointly estimated along with the 3D model.- The proposed method builds on recent neural implicit representations like NeRF which can represent geometry and appearance with MLPs. The key novelty is in the optimization strategy to enable joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.- Compared to learning-based single-image methods, this approach does not require training on objects from the same categories. It can generalize to reconstruct completely novel objects.- The incremental tracking and segmentation approach helps address challenges like drift and failure modes when new surfaces appear during manipulation. This seems like an important contribution for in-hand scanning.- The experiments convincingly demonstrate reconstruction and pose estimation results on par with or better than strong baselines including COLMAP and methods using ground truth poses.- Quantitative and qualitative results on challenging real datasets highlight the advantages over prior art, especially for texture-less objects where classic SfM methods fail.In summary, this paper makes nice contributions in terms of the problem formulation, the proposed method, and experiments on a practical use case. The approach outperforms prior works and could enable more widespread adoption of vision-based 3D scanning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are some key future research directions suggested in the paper:- Exploring different neural network architectures and loss functions for the occupancy and color fields to improve reconstruction quality. The authors mention autoencoders as a potential alternative to MLPs.- Incorporating hand pose information to provide additional cues for estimating object pose during challenging scenarios like texture-less and symmetric objects. - Extending the method to dynamic non-rigid objects like cloth by incorporating neural implicit representations that can model deformation.- Applying the approach to monocular dense SLAM systems by reconstructing both the background scene and the manipulated object. This could enable applications like persistent AR where virtual content needs to be anchored to real objects.- Developing ways to perform incremental tracking and surface completion in an end-to-endDifferentiable manner rather than splitting it into multiple stages.- Exploring ways to minimize or eliminate the need for pre-trained segmentation networks to obtain object masks. Self-supervised techniques for foreground segmentation could help here.- Extending the method to handle translucent and reflective objects where modeling visibility and appearance becomes more complex.In summary, the main future directions are improving representation capacity, incorporating additional cues like hand pose, expanding the scope to dynamic scenes and objects, reducing reliance on external modules like segmentation networks, and developing end-to-end frameworks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method for in-hand 3D object scanning from an RGB image sequence. The key idea is to simultaneously reconstruct the 3D model of the unknown object and estimate its pose in each frame. This is challenging because as the object rotates during scanning, visual features continuously appear and disappear which can cause tracking drift. To address this, the method splits the input sequence into overlapping segments based on the object's apparent area. Tracking and reconstruction is performed independently in each segment, which provides coarse pose estimates. The segments are then aligned and merged before performing a global optimization over all frames to achieve the final reconstruction. Key components of the approach include an optical flow loss for pose constraints, a shape regularization loss to prevent degenerate shapes, and a synthetic depth loss to stabilize tracking. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the approach can reconstruct both textured and textureless objects and estimate accurate pose trajectories. The method outperforms previous approaches like COLMAP that rely solely on visual features.
