# [Scaling Spherical CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05420)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to scale spherical CNNs to larger problems so they can be competitive with other state-of-the-art models. The key hypotheses are:- Larger spherical CNN models with adequate capacity and efficiency can achieve strong performance on real-world tasks involving spherical data and rotational symmetries.- Spherical CNNs can be competitive with graph neural networks and transformers on molecule property prediction and weather forecasting tasks.Specifically, the paper investigates:- Novel variants of common neural network components like nonlinearities, normalization, and residual connections that improve expressivity and efficiency of spherical CNNs.- An efficient implementation of spherical CNN operations optimized for TPUs.- Application-specific input representations and modeling choices for molecules and weather data that allow spherical CNNs to work well.The overarching goal is to demonstrate spherical CNNs can be scaled to much larger sizes than prior work, making them viable for complex scientific applications at a scale not previously possible. The experiments on molecular property prediction and multiple weather forecasting tasks aim to validate the hypotheses.
