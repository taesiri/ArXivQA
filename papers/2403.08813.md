# [Federated Deep Q-Learning and 5G load balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08813)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Load balancing between base stations is still a persisting issue in cellular networks despite technological advancements. Centralized resource allocation methods can solve the load balancing problem but are NP-hard and not practical for real-world network deployment.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using federated deep Q learning to inform each user equipment (UE) about the load status of each base station (BS) to achieve load balancing. 
- Each UE has a small deep Q learning model deployed locally that takes the UE's state and each BS's load as input and outputs the action of selecting the best BS for the UE to connect to in order to maximize its transmission rate.
- A xAPP deployed on the Near RT RIC platform in O-RAN architecture periodically broadcasts updated BS load information to UEs. The UEs use this to update their model's state and decide on BS selection. The xAPP also coordinates the handovers based on decisions from the UEs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a federated learning based load balancing approach with decentralized decision making at the UEs to reduce complexity and serverside computational load.
- Integrates the solution with O-RAN architecture by deploying xAPP and using Near RT RIC platform for handover coordination after local decisions at the UEs.
- Simulation results show minor increase in overall throughput and handovers compared to MAX-SINR scheme but consistent improved QoS across UEs with proposed method.

In summary, the paper presents a federated deep Q learning based load balancing technique for 5G networks that leverages O-RAN architecture to enable decentralized BS selection decisions at the UEs leading to reduced complexity and serverside load. The simulation results demonstrate consistent QoS improvements confirming the efficacy of the proposed solution.
