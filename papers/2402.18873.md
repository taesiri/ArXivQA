# [Reducing Hallucinations in Entity Abstract Summarization with   Facts-Template Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18873)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Entity abstract summarization aims to generate a correct and fluent summary about a given entity based on relevant Internet documents. However, current methods based on pretrained language models (PLMs) suffer from hallucinations - generating non-factual information about the entity. This is an intrinsic drawback of PLMs and is challenging to eliminate under the traditional sequence-to-sequence framework.

Proposed Solution: The authors propose a facts-template decomposition framework called SlotSum to reduce hallucinations. Specifically, they decompose the summary into two components - Facts that represent the key factual information about the entity which PLMs tend to fabricate, and Template that contains generic content with slots for facts that PLMs can generate properly. 

First, SlotSum generates a template with slots marked by special tokens from the input documents. Then, it predicts the facts for each slot based on the documents. To correct potential erroneous predictions, SlotSum rectifies the predictions with external knowledge sources. Finally, the summary is constructed by filling the predicted/corrected facts into the template slots.

Main Contributions:

- Propose SlotSum, an explainable entity abstract summarization framework that disentangles facts from summaries to reduce hallucinations.

- Construct a new dataset WikiFactSum by combining WikiSum and WikiBio to evaluate factuality of summaries.

- Experiments show SlotSum generates significantly more factual summaries than baseline models when provided with credible external knowledge, while retaining comparable performance without additional knowledge.

- The facts-template decomposition makes SlotSum highly controllable and explainable. Facts can be easily edited to ensure correctness.

In summary, by decomposing summaries into facts and templates, and integrating external knowledge, SlotSum is able to reduce hallucinations in an explainable way for entity abstract summarization.
