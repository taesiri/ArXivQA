# [Understanding prompt engineering may not require rethinking   generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03957)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Why does prompt engineering for vision-language models like CLIP suffer so little from overfitting, even when prompts are heavily tuned or optimized on a training set?

The paper investigates this question by analyzing prompt engineering through the lens of PAC-Bayes generalization bounds. The key hypotheses appear to be:

1)Treating prompts as a discrete hypothesis class and using a language model as a prior leads to tight PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for prompt engineering, even on large domains like ImageNet.

2) These bounds help explain why prompt engineering generalizes well despite manual tuning or greedy optimization of prompts on training data. 

3) Prompt engineering with vision-language models does not suffer from the same lack of theoretical grounding as conventional deep learning models when it comes to generalization.

So in summary, the central research question is understanding and explaining why prompt engineering seems to generalize so well, even when prompts are heavily tuned on training data. The paper hypothesizes that PAC-Bayes bounds with an LM prior provide a theoretical justification for this empirical observation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is showing that classical PAC-Bayes bounds, when applied to the discrete hypothesis class defined by prompts (with a language model prior), can provide remarkably tight generalization bounds for prompted vision-language models, even on complex datasets like ImageNet. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Demonstrating that prompt engineering does not seem to suffer from overfitting despite extensive tuning on the training set. The performance on held-out test data remains strong.

- Framing prompts as a discrete hypothesis class and applying PAC-Bayes bounds using a language model prior. This results in the tightest generalization bounds achieved thus far on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, often within just a few percent of the true test error. 

- Showing the bound serves well for model selection, as the prompts with the best bound tend to have the lowest test error.

- Providing evidence that discrete prompting methods are more robust to overfitting compared to conventional deep nets, e.g. not fitting random labels well.

- Highlighting the importance of the discrete nature of prompts combined with an informative prior (the language model) in enabling such tight generalization guarantees.

In summary, the work theoretically supports prompt engineering as a principled approach compared to conventional deep learning, despite its reliance on manual tuning. The tight generalization bounds are made possible by framing prompts as a relatively small, discrete hypothesis class amenable to classical PAC-Bayes analysis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that classical PAC-Bayes bounds, when applied to the discrete hypothesis class defined by prompts with a language model prior, provide remarkably tight generalization guarantees for prompt engineering on vision-language models, suggesting it may be a more principled approach than conventional deep learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points of comparison between this paper and other related work:

- This paper studies prompt engineering, which is an emerging paradigm for using large pretrained language models like CLIP in a zero-shot way for downstream tasks. Most prior work has focused on learning continuous prompt embeddings, while this paper analyzes discrete prompt tokens.

- For generalization bounds, this paper shows that classical PAC-Bayes bounds can give surprisingly tight non-vacuous guarantees for prompt engineering on large datasets like ImageNet. This is a significant improvement compared to prior PAC-Bayes bounds for deep learning models, which are often quite loose. 

- The paper frames prompt engineering as optimization over a discrete space of tokens. Related work has proposed gradient-based methods to directly learn discrete prompts, but analyzing generalization has been lacking. This paper provides a theoretical justification.

- Compared to general bounds for deep learning, analyzing prompts allows bypassing some fundamental challenges like accounting for model complexity. The discrete nature of prompts lets the authors leverage classical techniques like PAC-Bayes in a novel way.

- For model selection, the PAC-Bayes bound correlates well with test performance, unlike most bounds for neural networks. So these prompts bounds could practically guide practitioners.

- One limitation is that the strong guarantees rely on the generalization of the underlying vision-language model like CLIP. The analysis does not explain this. So the bounds are conditional on having a good base model.

In summary, this paper connects prompt engineering to classical statistical learning theory in a novel way. It shows both theoretically and empirically that discrete prompting circumvents challenges surrounding deep learning generalization. The discrete token space allows surprisingly tight non-vacuous bounds via basic tools like PAC-Bayes.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing tighter PAC-Bayes bounds for prompt engineering in the small data regime. The authors note that their bounds are still somewhat loose when only a small amount of labeled data is available. Exploring ways to obtain tighter PAC-Bayes bounds with few examples (such as using data-dependent priors) could be fruitful. 

- Investigating more sophisticated prompt search techniques. The greedy search algorithm used in the paper is simple but does not produce very coherent or interpretable prompts. The authors suggest exploring techniques like constrained optimization or leveraging other language models to generate more natural prompts.

- Analyzing the effects of different vocabulary choices. The paper shows that restricting the search vocabulary (e.g. to only English words) can improve interpretability and potentially generalization. More work could be done on studying how vocabulary selection impacts prompt engineering.

- Addressing the data contamination issue. The authors acknowledge the difficulty in evaluating true zero-shot performance when the foundation model may have seen the test data during pretraining. Approaches to measure or mitigate data contamination could better validate the generalization conclusions.  

- Connecting prompts to model internals. While the paper analyzes prompts from an input space perspective, connecting the discrete prompts to representations and computations inside the foundation model could provide more insight into why prompt engineering generalizes well.

- Scaling up prompt analysis. The empirical study focuses on smaller image datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet. Evaluating whether the conclusions hold for larger-scale domains like video, speech, and multi-modal tasks could be interesting.

In summary, the authors point to several directions like tighter bounds, more sophisticated search, investigating properties like vocab choice and interpretability, mitigating data contamination, and connecting prompts to model internals as avenues for future work. Advancing our theoretical understanding of prompt engineering seems like the overarching theme.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper demonstrates that classical PAC-Bayes generalization bounds, when applied to the discrete hypothesis class defined by prompts engineered for vision-language models like CLIP, are remarkably tight even for large and complex datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. The authors show that treating prompt engineering as defining a distribution over discrete tokens, and using a language model as a prior over those tokens, yields PAC-Bayes bounds that are vastly tighter than prior bounds for deep learning models. For instance, they achieve a 32% error bound on ImageNet classification which is within 6% of the true test error. This suggests that, despite potential overfitting during prompt engineering, it provides a well-grounded approach to building classifiers with pretrained models. The tight generalization guarantees contrast with conventional deep learning models that lack clear theoretical justification. However, the analysis relies on the generalization ability of the underlying vision-language model itself. Overall, this work provides theoretical justification for the common practice of prompt engineering, showing it does not suffer from the same lack of understanding as other deep learning techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper demonstrates that classical PAC-Bayes bounds, when applied to the discrete hypothesis class defined by prompts for pretrained vision-language models, can provide remarkably tight generalization guarantees. The authors show that by using a language model as a prior over prompts and treating engineered prompts as a point mass posterior, they can derive PAC-Bayes bounds that are often within just a few percentage points of the true test error, even on complex datasets like ImageNet. For example, their bound for an ImageNet classifier is only 6% looser than the actual test error. This represents a significant improvement over prior PAC-Bayes bounds for deep learning models. The tightness of these prompt-based bounds supports the idea that prompt engineering, despite potential overfitting during manual tuning, provides a principled approach to harnessing pretrained models.

The core insight enabling these tight bounds is the discrete nature of engineered prompts. By applying PAC-Bayes to distributions over tokens rather than neural network weights, the authors can leverage the strong prior provided by a language model. Their bounds rely on an assumption that the vision-language encoder is not trained on the prompt engineering dataset, since this would implicitly add model complexity not captured in the bound. While hard to verify for existing models like CLIP, the authors argue this is similar to typical zero-shot evaluations. Overall, this work provides a theoretical justification for the common practice of prompt engineering, in contrast to the lack of generalization theory surrounding conventional deep learning. The simplicity of achieving non-vacuous bounds highlights the value of discrete prompts for controlled use of pretrained models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper studies the generalization properties of discrete prompts for image classification using pretrained vision-language models like CLIP. It proposes using classical PAC-Bayes bounds, with a language model like LLaMA as a prior over the discrete prompt space, to derive generalization guarantees on prompts. The KL divergence between this prior and the point mass posterior given by a specific prompt provides a bound on the generalization error. Empirically, this PAC-Bayes bound is remarkably tight, often within just a few percent of the actual test error, on datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet when applied to prompts produced via greedy search or manual engineering. The discrete nature of the prompt space, compared to the continuous parameter space of neural networks, enables much tighter generalization guarantees. Overall, this principled use of PAC-Bayes bounds provides a theoretical justification for the common practice of prompt engineering despite concerns over potential overfitting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of the paper are:

- The paper is studying the generalization behavior and theoretical guarantees of prompt engineering for image classification tasks using pretrained vision-language models like CLIP. 

- In particular, it aims to explain why prompt engineering seems to work well without overfitting, even when prompts are manually designed or optimized in a greedy fashion on the training data.

- The authors show that classical PAC-Bayes bounds, applied to the discrete hypotheses defined by text prompts, are remarkably tight - often within just a few percent of the actual test error on datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet. 

- This demonstrates that prompt engineering has much better generalization properties compared to conventional deep learning models, for which obtaining non-vacuous bounds is very difficult.

- The authors argue this provides a theoretical justification for the common practice of prompt engineering, despite concerns it could potentially overfit. The tight generalization bounds show it is actually a principled approach.

- However, the efficacy of prompts still fundamentally relies on the generalization of the underlying vision-language model, which the analysis does not address.

In summary, the key question is why prompt engineering works well without overfitting, and the authors provide evidence this is due to the discrete nature of prompts enabling tight generalization bounds using standard techniques like PAC-Bayes.

- Generalization - The ability of a model to perform well on new unseen data, not just the training data. Understanding generalization is key to building reliable ML systems.

- PAC-Bayes bounds - A technique from statistical learning theory to derive generalization bounds or guarantees on a model's test error. 

- Tight bounds - The PAC-Bayes bounds derived for prompt engineering are remarkably tight, often within a few percent of the true test error. This is a big improvement over bounds for deep learning models.

- Discrete prompts - Treating prompts as discrete tokens provides a relatively small hypothesis space amenable to theoretical analysis. This is contrasted with continuous/soft prompts.

- Language model prior - Using a pre-trained language model as the prior over prompts is crucial for obtaining tight PAC-Bayes bounds.

- Data contamination - An issue is that the vision model may be contaminated by seeing the training data, violating assumptions. But prompt engineering seems robust empirically.

- Structural risk minimization - Optimizing PAC-Bayes bounds during search leads to tighter bounds and less overfitting.

In summary, the key ideas are around explaining why prompt engineering generalizes well by modeling it as discrete search with an informative language model prior and deriving tight generalization guarantees via PAC-Bayes bounds and structural risk minimization.
