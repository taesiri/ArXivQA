# [Adaptive Spot-Guided Transformer for Consistent Local Feature Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16624)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to obtain dense correspondences between images while maintaining local consistency and handling large scale variations.The key hypotheses are:1. Maintaining local consistency in matching can be achieved by using a spot-guided aggregation module, where each pixel is guided by similar high-confidence neighboring pixels to focus attention on local candidate regions. 2. Handling large scale variations can be achieved by using an adaptive scaling module, where depth information from coarse matches is used to crop grids of adaptive sizes for refinement.So in summary, the paper proposes a novel Adaptive Spot-guided Transformer (ASTR) that jointly handles these two challenges in a unified architecture to achieve consistent and robust local feature matching. The spot-guided aggregation module aims to maintain local consistency, while the adaptive scaling module handles scale changes.
