# [Improving Lens Flare Removal with General Purpose Pipeline and Multiple   Light Sources Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16460)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) How to synthesize more realistic flare-corrupted images to simulate the general auto-exposure mode and take tone mapping into consideration? 2) How to recover one or multiple light sources naturally and avoid the hard threshold?The key points are:- The paper argues that existing methods for synthesizing flare-corrupted images by directly adding flare images to scene images do not properly account for tone mapping and auto-exposure effects in real camera image processing pipelines. This can lead to unrealistic synthetic images. - The paper proposes a new pipeline to synthesize flare images that uses pixel-wise convex combinations between scene and flare images in inverse gamma space. This is claimed to produce more realistic flare images.- Existing flare removal methods often remove light sources along with flare. The paper proposes a new strategy to recover multiple light sources of varying shapes, illumination, etc by convexly averaging input and output based on illuminance levels. This avoids hard thresholds.- Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis pipeline and light source recovery strategy. A new test dataset of real flare images from consumer electronics is also introduced to evaluate generalization.In summary, the main goals are to improve realism of synthetic flare images and better preserve light sources through new proposed techniques. The central hypotheses appear to be that these techniques will enhance flare removal performance and generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a new method to synthesize more realistic flare-corrupted images for training flare removal models. This avoids issues like distribution shift and overflow compared to prior synthesis methods.2. Developing a new strategy to smoothly recover multiple light sources in a flare removal result, avoiding hard thresholds used in prior work. 3. Contributing a new test dataset of real flare images from various consumer cameras to evaluate generalization of flare removal methods. 4. Showing improved lens flare removal performance and light source preservation using their proposed synthesis pipeline and recovery strategy. Experiments demonstrate benefits over prior state-of-the-art flare removal methods.In summary, the key novelties seem to be in flare image synthesis, light source recovery, and benchmark dataset contribution to push the state-of-the-art in computational lens flare removal and evaluation. The proposed methods aim to improve realism, avoid artifacts, and recover details better than prior techniques.
