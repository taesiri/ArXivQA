## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MUSE, a novel multi-locality search algorithm for automating quantum variational learning. MUSE systematically searches multiple neighborhoods in the space of initial points to find the best combinations of initial points, circuit parameters, and data preprocessing options that maximize the performance of quantum variational classifiers and regressors. Through extensive simulations on real-world datasets, the authors demonstrate that MUSE boosts the accuracy of quantum variational classifiers by 2.3x on average and improves the predictive quality of quantum variational regressors from negative to positive R^2 scores. Moreover, with MUSE, the performance of quantum variational models becomes on par with classical machine learning counterparts like SVMs, random forests, and neural networks. The simulations provide strong evidence that MUSE can effectively optimize key factors like initial conditions and preprocessing to unlock the power of quantum variational circuits across both classification and regression tasks. By automating the search for high-performance operating points, MUSE is a promising step towards scalable, practical quantum variational learning.
