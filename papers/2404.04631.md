# [On the Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs): False Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04631)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the limitation of large language models (LLMs) with regards to false attribution, which is the incorrect representation that someone is the author of a work when they actually are not. Specifically, the authors study how recent state-of-the-art LLMs perform on the task of automatic author attribution for short texts from books. Accurate author attribution is important but can be challenging and costly to obtain human annotations.  

Methodology:
The authors select the 10 most popular books according to Project Gutenberg and split them into chunks of 400 words. Three open access, state-of-the-art LLMs are evaluated: LLaMA-2-13B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemma-7B. The models are prompted in a zero-shot setting to predict the author for each chunk. Then 162 chunks from each book are randomly sampled for human evaluation, based on a confidence level of 95% and margin of error of 7%. A new hallucination metric called Simple Hallucination Index (SHI) is also introduced.  

Results: 
Mixtral 8x7B has the best accuracy of 73.7% and lowest average SHI of 0.249, but still suffers from high hallucination (SHI of 0.87) for some books. There is a strong negative correlation between accuracy and SHI, demonstrating SHI's effectiveness in scoring hallucinations. All models perform poorly on books written by Smollett.

Contributions:
1) A new generalizable hallucination metric SHI for evaluating LLMs. 
2) Publicly released LLM-annotated data chunks that can aid attribution tasks.
3) First systematic demonstration of false attribution problem in LLMs for book chunks.

The paper provides valuable insights into the limitations of LLMs regarding hallucinations and false attributions. The introduced SHI metric can help build more trustworthy AI systems. Analyzing the problem better enables more focused efforts towards solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates three large language models on the task of author attribution for short texts from popular books, introduces a new metric to quantify hallucination, and finds that while the models can perform well, they still demonstrate concerning levels of hallucination, especially for certain authors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is threefold:

1. It introduces a new metric called the Simple Hallucination Index (SHI) to quantify the amount of hallucination or false attribution in the predictions made by large language models (LLMs) on an author attribution task. 

2. It evaluates three state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA-2-13B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemma-7B) on the task of author attribution for short text chunks from the 10 most popular books on Project Gutenberg. It systematically analyzes their performance and hallucination rates using the new SHI metric.

3. It publicly releases the LLM-annotated datasets of text chunks from these books to aid further research and benchmarking of models on this task. The paper also shows the limitation of LLMs regarding false attribution on this dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and demonstration of a new generalizable metric called SHI to quantify hallucination in LLMs, an evaluation of LLMs for false attribution on a new dataset, and the public release of that dataset.

The paper introduces a new metric called the Simple Hallucination Index (SHI) to measure the tendency of LLMs to falsely attribute authorship of texts. It evaluates three state-of-the-art LLMs in a zero-shot setting on the task of author attribution for short chunks of text from popular books. The key terms reflect this focus on analyzing hallucination and accuracy tradeoffs for LLMs on an author attribution task, using a new proposed metric.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new hallucination metric called SHI. What are the key components that make up this metric and what does each component measure? How is it different from existing metrics like truthfulness and factuality ensemble?

2. The authors evaluate 3 LLMs (LLaMA-2-13B, Mixtral 8x7B, Gemma-7B) on the task of author attribution. What specific capabilities of these models make them suitable for this task? What are their key differences?  

3. The authors use a sample size of 162 chunks per book for human evaluation. Walk through the statistical calculations used to arrive at this number based on confidence level and margin of error. How would the sample size change if different values were chosen?

4. The annotation methodology has a 3-fold loop with iterative prompt redesign. Explain each phase of this loop (initial prompt, follow up prompt 1, follow up prompt 2) and the types of issues they were designed to address. 

5. The paper finds that all 3 LLMs struggle with attributing chunks from Smollett's books to the correct author. Analyze possible reasons why Smollett's writing style or content could be more challenging for neural models compared to other authors.

6. Accuracy has a strong negative correlation with the SHI metric across models. Explain why this correlation makes logical sense and provides evidence for SHI effectively capturing hallucination.

7. Even though Mixtral 8x7B has the best overall performance, it has a high SHI score of 0.87 for one book. Analyze the tradeoffs between predictive accuracy and propensity for hallucination. 

8. The books are split into 400 word chunks. Discuss the considerations in selecting an appropriate chunk size and how it impacts model performance. What would be the tradeoffs of using smaller or larger chunk sizes?

9. The paper focuses solely on English language books. How could the methodology be extended to model performance across other languages? What additional complexities might arise?

10. The authors suggest evaluating closed LLMs like ChatGPT as future work. Compare the differences in model architecture, data, and training between closed vs open LLMs. What specific advantages or limitations might closed LLMs have for this task?
