# [FRDiff: Feature Reuse for Exquisite Zero-shot Acceleration of Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03517)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose FRDiff, a novel method to accelerate diffusion models by exploiting temporal redundancy in feature maps. They observe high similarity in specific intermediate feature maps across adjacent denoising steps, enabling reuse of features without quality degradation. Compared to simply reducing model evaluations, feature reuse better retains high-frequency details. However, it struggles with low frequencies, while reducing evaluations does the opposite. Thus, FRDiff strategically combines both - using "jumps" to preserve low frequencies initially, and feature reuse later to maintain details. Additionally, they propose a "score mixing" technique that linearly interpolates the jump and reuse scores based on a schedule. Experiments across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate 1.8x acceleration over advanced sampling techniques within the same quality level. The method is broadly applicable in a zero-shot manner without additional fine-tuning. In summary, FRDiff advances zero-shot optimization of diffusion models by jointly leveraging reduced evaluations and feature reuse, striking an improved speed versus fidelity trade-off.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called FRDiff that can accelerate diffusion models by reusing feature maps with high temporal similarity across denoising steps, achieving up to 1.8x speedup without compromising output quality or requiring additional fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing FRDiff, a novel diffusion model acceleration method by exploiting temporal redundancy in the model's feature maps. 

2. Identifying that the diffusion model's feature maps exhibit high similarity across neighboring time steps.

3. Proposing a Feature Reusing (FR) based method that can skip computation of layers by reusing the output feature maps from preceding time steps.

4. Proposing a score mixing method to further enhance output quality by balancing frequency components of the diffusion model. 

5. Showing extensive results demonstrating that FRDiff can further accelerate existing sampling methods by up to 1.8x without any additional training on various tasks and datasets.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Diffusion models can generate high-quality and diverse images but suffer from expensive computational costs due to the repeated denoising steps required. This poses a major obstacle to their widespread adoption. Previous work has attempted to address this by reducing denoising steps using advanced solvers, but this misses opportunities to update fine details and causes quality degradation.

Key Idea:
This paper proposes to reuse feature maps with high temporal similarity across frames to save computation without compromising quality. Their analysis shows certain modules in diffusion models exhibit such redundancy. Reusing these features selectively can accelerate diffusion models significantly.

Proposed Method (FRDiff):
1) Feature Reuse (FR) - Reuse feature maps of residual and transformer blocks from preceding "keyframe" steps. Allows acceleration without additional training.

2) Score Mixing - Linearly interpolate reused and original scores over time. Uses reused score in later steps to preserve high-freq details, and original score in early steps to maintain low-freq content.

Contributions:  
1) Identify and analyze temporal redundancy in diffusion models to motivate feature reuse
2) Propose FRDiff method combining feature reuse and score mixing for Pareto-optimal quality/latency tradeoff
3) Demonstrate up to 1.8x acceleration over baselines on various diffusion models and datasets, without fine-tuning
4) Provide extensive analysis and ablation studies on design choices to validate approach

In summary, this paper makes diffusion models much faster using feature reuse, unlocking their practical benefits with minimal constraints. FRDiff pushes state-of-the-art in zero-shot acceleration.
