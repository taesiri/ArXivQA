# [FRDiff: Feature Reuse for Exquisite Zero-shot Acceleration of Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03517)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose FRDiff, a novel method to accelerate diffusion models by exploiting temporal redundancy in feature maps. They observe high similarity in specific intermediate feature maps across adjacent denoising steps, enabling reuse of features without quality degradation. Compared to simply reducing model evaluations, feature reuse better retains high-frequency details. However, it struggles with low frequencies, while reducing evaluations does the opposite. Thus, FRDiff strategically combines both - using "jumps" to preserve low frequencies initially, and feature reuse later to maintain details. Additionally, they propose a "score mixing" technique that linearly interpolates the jump and reuse scores based on a schedule. Experiments across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate 1.8x acceleration over advanced sampling techniques within the same quality level. The method is broadly applicable in a zero-shot manner without additional fine-tuning. In summary, FRDiff advances zero-shot optimization of diffusion models by jointly leveraging reduced evaluations and feature reuse, striking an improved speed versus fidelity trade-off.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called FRDiff that can accelerate diffusion models by reusing feature maps with high temporal similarity across denoising steps, achieving up to 1.8x speedup without compromising output quality or requiring additional fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing FRDiff, a novel diffusion model acceleration method by exploiting temporal redundancy in the model's feature maps. 

2. Identifying that the diffusion model's feature maps exhibit high similarity across neighboring time steps.

3. Proposing a Feature Reusing (FR) based method that can skip computation of layers by reusing the output feature maps from preceding time steps.

4. Proposing a score mixing method to further enhance output quality by balancing frequency components of the diffusion model. 

5. Showing extensive results demonstrating that FRDiff can further accelerate existing sampling methods by up to 1.8x without any additional training on various tasks and datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is exploiting temporal redundancy in the diffusion model's feature maps to reuse features across time and enhance sampling efficiency, along with a score mixing technique to maintain output quality. The method provides significant acceleration on multiple models and tasks in a zero-shot manner.
