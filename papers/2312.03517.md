# [FRDiff: Feature Reuse for Exquisite Zero-shot Acceleration of Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03517)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose FRDiff, a novel method to accelerate diffusion models by exploiting temporal redundancy in feature maps. They observe high similarity in specific intermediate feature maps across adjacent denoising steps, enabling reuse of features without quality degradation. Compared to simply reducing model evaluations, feature reuse better retains high-frequency details. However, it struggles with low frequencies, while reducing evaluations does the opposite. Thus, FRDiff strategically combines both - using "jumps" to preserve low frequencies initially, and feature reuse later to maintain details. Additionally, they propose a "score mixing" technique that linearly interpolates the jump and reuse scores based on a schedule. Experiments across various diffusion models and datasets demonstrate 1.8x acceleration over advanced sampling techniques within the same quality level. The method is broadly applicable in a zero-shot manner without additional fine-tuning. In summary, FRDiff advances zero-shot optimization of diffusion models by jointly leveraging reduced evaluations and feature reuse, striking an improved speed versus fidelity trade-off.
