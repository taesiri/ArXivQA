# [SEEDS: Emulation of Weather Forecast Ensembles with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can deep generative diffusion models be used to efficiently emulate operational weather forecast ensembles and generate a large number of plausible and skillful ensemble members at low computational cost?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Diffusion models can be trained on historical forecast data to learn to generate new ensemble members with realistic spatial coherence, correlations, and spectral characteristics.2) The generated ensembles can match or exceed the skill of operational physics-based ensembles in terms of predictive metrics like RMSE, anomaly correlation, and CRPS. 3) The models can generate thousands of ensemble members at negligible computational cost after training, enabling assessment of extreme or rare events.4) When trained to correct systematic biases, the generated ensembles can be more reliable and accurate for tail events compared to the original operational ensembles.5) The methodology can augment existing small operational ensembles by in-filling gaps and expanding the envelope of possible states beyond the few operational samples.So in summary, the central research thrust is using deep generative modeling to create skillful and inexpensive emulators of operational forecast ensembles for uncertainty quantification. The key hypotheses relate to the realism, skill, extreme event coverage, debiasing ability, and efficiency of the proposed approach.
