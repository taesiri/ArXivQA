# [SEEDS: Emulation of Weather Forecast Ensembles with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14066)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can deep generative diffusion models be used to efficiently emulate operational weather forecast ensembles and generate a large number of plausible and skillful ensemble members at low computational cost?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Diffusion models can be trained on historical forecast data to learn to generate new ensemble members with realistic spatial coherence, correlations, and spectral characteristics.2) The generated ensembles can match or exceed the skill of operational physics-based ensembles in terms of predictive metrics like RMSE, anomaly correlation, and CRPS. 3) The models can generate thousands of ensemble members at negligible computational cost after training, enabling assessment of extreme or rare events.4) When trained to correct systematic biases, the generated ensembles can be more reliable and accurate for tail events compared to the original operational ensembles.5) The methodology can augment existing small operational ensembles by in-filling gaps and expanding the envelope of possible states beyond the few operational samples.So in summary, the central research thrust is using deep generative modeling to create skillful and inexpensive emulators of operational forecast ensembles for uncertainty quantification. The key hypotheses relate to the realism, skill, extreme event coverage, debiasing ability, and efficiency of the proposed approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new method called SEEDS (Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler) that uses deep generative diffusion models to emulate physics-based ensemble weather forecasts. The key idea is to use just a few (e.g. 2) physics-based forecasts to condition the generative model to sample a much larger ensemble (e.g. 512 members).2. Demonstrating two variants of SEEDS: one for generative ensemble emulation that aims to match the distribution of the operational forecast ensemble, and another for generative post-processing that aims to correct biases compared to reanalysis data. 3. Showing that the generated ensembles have similar or improved statistical properties and forecast skill compared to the operational physics-based ensembles, especially for rare/extreme events. The generated samples also have realistic spatial coherence and spectral characteristics.4. Highlighting the computational efficiency of the approach - it can generate hundreds to tens of thousands of ensemble members at a fraction of the cost of running the physics-based model.5. Discussing the potential of using this generative AI approach for uncertainty quantification in weather forecasting and climate modeling more broadly.So in summary, the key novelty is using deep generative models to emulate operational weather forecast ensembles in a computationally efficient manner, with results suggesting this is a promising approach to improve ensemble forecasts and quantify uncertainty.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on using AI to generate probabilistic weather forecasts:- Previous work has focused on using AI to improve aggregate forecast statistics like the ensemble mean and spread. This paper differs in that it uses a generative model to sample full high-dimensional weather maps that retain spatial correlations.- Other studies have used convolutional neural networks or GANs to generate or enhance a global measure of forecast uncertainty. This paper employs a transformer architecture tailored to the structure of atmospheric data to generate weather-like maps.- Prior work has shown skill in calibrating or debiasing limited-size ensembles. A unique aspect here is using a generative model to create very large ensembles (100s to 1000s of members) at low computational cost.- The proposed method directly outputs weather forecast samples, as opposed to just uncertainty estimates. This allows capturing variable interactions and enables new applications compared to solely getting the mean and spread.- The paper demonstrates that the generative model can accurately capture tail events and assign higher probabilities to rare weather occurrences that traditional small ensembles miss.- It introduces a generative post-processing task, beyond just emulating the operational ensemble, to correct for biases and improve reliability.- The method is shown to extract meaningful forecast information beyond what is contained in the few input seeding forecasts. This suggests it learns representations of the dynamical attractor.In summary, the key novelties are the use of a tailored generative model to create full weather forecast ensembles that retain spatial and variable correlations, the ability to generate large ensembles at low computational cost, and the demonstration of skill in forecasting rare events relative to limited-size physics ensembles.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Conducting case studies on high-impact weather events to further evaluate the performance of their SEEDS model, especially for applications like tropical cyclone tracking.- Exploring more deeply the statistical modeling mechanisms used by models like SEEDS to extract information from weather data and infill the ensemble forecast distribution. This could provide more insight into how the models are able to generate informative ensemble members beyond just the seeds.- Applying the generative AI methodology to climate modeling, where generating a large number of ensemble climate projections is important for quantifying uncertainty about future climate. The authors believe this approach could play an increasing role in climate risk assessment. - In general, the authors believe their application of generative AI to weather forecast emulation is just one of many ways it could help accelerate progress in operational numerical weather prediction. They hope their work spurs more applications of generative AI in weather and climate research.So in summary, some of the key directions are: more in-depth case studies and model analysis, extending the approach to climate modeling, and exploring other applications of generative AI to weather forecasting and climate projection. The authors see their work as part of a broader trend of leveraging AI to improve weather and climate modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes the use of deep generative diffusion models for probabilistic weather forecasting. The method amortizes the computational cost of traditional ensemble forecasting by learning to emulate ensembles from historical training data. The models are trained on retrospective forecasts from an operational forecasting system and can generate additional ensemble members by conditioning on only a few seed forecasts from the operational system. The generated ensembles are shown to have similar statistical properties and predictive skill compared to traditional physics-based ensembles. A variant of the approach that blends the operational ensemble with a reanalysis dataset during training is also proposed, which helps reduce systematic biases in the operational system. Overall, the generative modeling approach enables inexpensive generation of very large ensemble forecasts, which is particularly beneficial for quantifying the likelihood of extreme weather events. The computational efficiency and scalability of the method could enable new applications in both weather forecasting and climate modeling.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in two paragraphs:The paper proposes a method to efficiently generate large ensembles of weather forecasts using generative artificial intelligence. The approach relies on probabilistic diffusion models, which are first trained on historical forecast data to learn the distribution of plausible weather states. The models can then generate an unlimited number of new ensemble forecasts by taking just 1 or 2 operational forecast members as input seeds. The generated ensembles not only produce realistic weather maps, but also match or exceed the skill of traditional physics-based ensembles across a range of metrics including RMSE, anomaly correlation, and extreme event likelihoods. A key advantage is the low computational cost, with the models able to generate hundreds of forecast members per minute on a TPU cluster. Two versions of the generative model are developed: one that emulates the operational ensemble distribution, and another that corrects for biases in the operational system by blending in historical reanalysis data during training. Experiments demonstrate that both models can produce reliable and skilled ensemble forecasts. The bias-corrected generative model is particularly effective, providing the most reliable forecasts globally across lead times and the highest skill for extreme events. Overall, the proposed generative approach enables inexpensive creation of very large ensembles, overcoming computational constraints and enhancing assessment of high impact weather risks. The method offers an efficient alternative to traditional ensemble forecasting that could augment physics-based prediction systems.
