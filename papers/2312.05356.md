# [Neuron Patching: Neuron-level Model Editing on Code Generation and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Neuron Patching: Neuron-level Model Editing on Code Generation and LLMs":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being adopted for code generation tasks but require regular updates to fix bugs, improve safety, and handle new versions of dependencies. 
- Retraining LLMs is costly and can lead to catastrophic forgetting. Rule-based methods lack flexibility to cover accumulated changes. 
- There is a need for effective, efficient and reliable techniques to update the knowledge in LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a neuron-level model editing approach called MENT (Model Editing via Neuron Targeting) to modify coder LLMs.
- It locates buggy neurons using attribution methods, estimates oracle parameters to overwrite those neurons, and plans neuron update order using a novel editing gain measure.  
- MENT edits a small number of neurons (1-2 neurons) to change model behavior for a specific input, enabling fast and precise updates.

Key Contributions:
- First work on neuron-level editing of generative models for improving code generation quality.
- MENT is an effective approach that outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin on next-token prediction tasks.
- MENT is efficient, resolving errors by patching only 1-2 critical neurons on average.
- Evaluation on a new benchmark shows MENT strikes a good balance between generalization and specificity.
- Case study demonstrates MENT's compatibility with LLM chain-of-thought reasoning to automatically update dependent behaviors.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel neuron-level model editing technique called MENT that can effectively, efficiently and reliably update the knowledge in LLMs for coding tasks. It edits only a very small number of neurons to change model behaviors as needed, making it suitable for continuous learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MENT, a novel and effective neuron-level model editing approach to patch transformer language models for high-quality source code generation by locating and overwriting critical neurons to resolve errors in next-token predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It proposes a novel and effective model editing approach called MENT (Model Editing via Neuron Targeting) for patching large language models (LLMs) to resolve errors in next-token prediction for coding tasks. 

2. It introduces formal definitions and new concepts like "patch set", "probe set", "edit-action", "skip-action", etc. to clarify the model editing process.

3. It evaluates MENT extensively on three coding tasks - API-seq recommendation, line-level code generation, and pseudocode-to-code translation. The results show MENT is effective, efficient, and reliable in terms of generalization and specificity compared to baselines. The paper also releases a new benchmark dataset for evaluating generalization and specificity of model editing techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating the novel MENT approach for effectively and reliably editing LLMs to resolve errors in next-token predictions for coding tasks. The introduced concepts and benchmark dataset also enable further research into model editing.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Model editing - The overall concept of modifying the parameters of a pretrained neural model to update its knowledge and behaviors.

- Neuron-level model editing - Editing models at the granularity of individual neurons, as opposed to layer-level editing.

- Code generation - The paper focuses on using model editing to improve code generation by large language models. Relevant tasks include API sequence recommendation, line-level code generation, and pseudocode to code translation.  

- Effectiveness - Evaluating the capability of model editing techniques to successfully resolve errors in language model predictions.

- Efficiency - Assessing the speed and number of edited neurons required to resolve language model errors. 

- Generalization - The ability of edits to improve predictions on new, unseen data related to the original data used for editing.

- Specificity - The degree to which edits impact only related data and predictions based on the intent of the editing, without affecting unrelated predictions.

- Attribution methods - Used to identify critical neurons contributing to incorrect predictions that should be edited.

- Heuristic oracle estimation - Techniques proposed to efficiently compute updated parameter values for edited neurons.

- Planning - Prioritizing the order in which critical neurons are edited based on expected gains.

The key focus is using targeted neuron-level edits to effectively and efficiently improve code generation model performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the intuition behind using Input X Gradient for locating the buggy neurons in MENT? Why is it more suitable than other attribution methods for this task?

2. How does MENT construct the virtual probability distribution where the target token becomes the argmax token? Explain the ladder swapping algorithm for achieving this.

3. The paper mentions pathway-level editing in MENT. Explain what a pathway refers to in this context and how editing at the pathway-level is different from standard MENT.

4. What are the pros and cons of using the neuron-parameter oracle proposed in MENT versus more straightforward approaches like simply swapping target and argmax token probabilities?

5. Explain the edit-action simulation and editing-gain measure used by MENT to prioritize the order of patching buggy neurons. Why is this better than directly using attribution scores?  

6. Compare and contrast the effects of MENT with intrinsic editing techniques like KN versus extrinsic editing techniques like GRACE. What are the tradeoffs?

7. How suitable is MENT for tasks requiring high-quality reasoning versus simpler tasks like synonym replacement? Explain with examples of potential use cases.

8. What are some ways the localization of buggy neurons in MENT could be further improved? For example, by incorporating editing strategy into the attribution process.

9. The paper demonstrates MENT's capability to automatically propagate edited knowledge through chain-of-thought reasoning. Expand on the significance of this capability.

10. What directions for future work on neuron-level model editing does this paper motivate? What are remaining open challenges?
