# [TreeForm: End-to-end Annotation and Evaluation for Form Document Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Form understanding is an important task in visually rich document understanding (VRFU). However, current datasets like FUNSD have limitations: they decompose the task into separate labeling and linking tasks, have annotation inconsistencies, and don't fully capture hierarchical structures like tables. This makes end-to-end evaluation and complete form parsing difficult.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes new end-to-end evaluation metrics for FUNSD-style annotations, including a tree F1 score and node alignment accuracy (NAA) metric.
- It introduces a new tree-based annotation scheme called TreeForm that more fully captures form structure in a JSON format, including headers, questions/answers, and tables. 
- It details how to convert FUNSD annotations to TreeForm, using spatial information and heuristics to reconstruct details like tables.
- TreeForm predictions can be evaluated using a modified normalized tree edit distance called GAnTED.

Main Contributions:
- Novel end-to-end metrics to evaluate FUNSD annotation predictions
- New TreeForm annotation scheme that more completely captures form structure
- Method to convert FUNSD to TreeForm annotations 
- Evaluation of TreeForm using GAnTED scores
- Experiments applying state-of-the-art models on FUNSD and TreeForm, assessing tradeoffs and providing initial baselines

In summary, the paper tackles limitations of existing form understanding datasets by proposing improved evaluation schemes and a new TreeForm annotation format that could enable better form parsing. Initial experiments showcase some benefits of these proposals.
