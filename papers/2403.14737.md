# [FedMef: Towards Memory-efficient Federated Dynamic Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "FedMef: Towards Memory-efficient Federated Dynamic Pruning":

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of models across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, deploying FL on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to the high demand for computation and memory to train deep learning models. 
- Existing federated pruning methods rely on initially training dense models which is not suitable for edge devices. Recent works use federated dynamic pruning but suffer from significant accuracy drop after pruning and high activation memory usage.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FedMef, a novel memory-efficient federated dynamic pruning framework to generate specialized sparse models directly on devices.

Key Components:
- Budget-Aware Extrusion (BaE): Salvages important information from low-magnitude parameters marked for pruning by transferring it to other parameters using a surrogate loss function. This preserves post-pruning accuracy.
- Scaled Activation Pruning (SAP): Effectively reduces activation memory usage by pruning activations during training using Normalized Sparse Convolutions, which centers activations around zero.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces BaE to reduce information loss during federated dynamic pruning, preserving post-pruning accuracy.
- Proposes SAP to significantly compress activation memory without relying on batch normalization layers.
- Achieves superior accuracy and 28.5% memory savings compared to state-of-the-art methods on image classification datasets and models.
- Establishes new benchmarks for federated dynamic pruning on more complex datasets like CINIC-10 and TinyImageNet.

In summary, the paper makes vital contributions in addressing issues of post-pruning accuracy drop and high activation memory in federated dynamic pruning to facilitate specialized sparse model development directly on resource-constrained edge devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

FedMef is a federated learning framework that introduces budget-aware extrusion to reduce information loss during pruning and scaled activation pruning to effectively compress activation caches, achieving higher accuracy and lower memory footprint compared to prior federated dynamic pruning methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing FedMef, a novel federated dynamic pruning framework that is memory-efficient. FedMef has two key components:

1) Budget-aware extrusion (BaE): This is proposed to address the issue of significant post-pruning accuracy degradation in existing federated dynamic pruning methods. BaE transfers essential information from low-magnitude parameters marked for pruning to other parameters, preserving this information and minimizing accuracy loss during pruning. 

2) Scaled activation pruning (SAP): This is proposed to reduce the high activation memory usage of models, which is a problem not addressed well in prior federated dynamic pruning works. SAP effectively prunes activation caches during training to reduce memory footprints. To enhance SAP's efficacy, the paper utilizes Normalized Sparse Convolution layers instead of batch normalization.

In summary, FedMef with these two components is able to deliver specialized sparse models that meet accuracy and memory constraints, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets and models based on the experiments shown. It makes federated learning more amenable for resource-constrained edge devices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Federated learning (FL): The paper focuses on applying neural network pruning techniques to federated learning scenarios.

- Dynamic pruning: The paper proposes a framework for federated dynamic pruning, which adaptively prunes and grows the model during training. 

- Budget-aware extrusion (BaE): A technique proposed in the paper to transfer information from parameters marked for pruning to others before pruning to prevent accuracy loss.

- Scaled activation pruning (SAP): Another technique proposed to prune activation caches to reduce memory usage, using Normalized Sparse Convolution layers.  

- Memory footprint: The paper aims to create specialized pruned models that meet both accuracy and memory constraints, so memory footprint is a key term.

- Post-pruning accuracy degradation: The paper addresses the issue of models losing significant accuracy after pruning in federated scenarios.

- Model efficiency: Pruning helps enhance model efficiency and reduce resource usage, an important consideration in cross-device federated learning.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around federated learning, dynamic pruning techniques, maximizing efficiency and accuracy with limited memory, preventing post-pruning degradation, and meeting on-device constraints.
