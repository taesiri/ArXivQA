## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Designing effective prompts/instructions to elicit high-quality responses from large language models (LLMs) can be challenging. 
- There is a need for guidelines on crafting prompts that optimize LLMs' performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces 26 principles for creating better prompts when querying different scales of LLMs. 
- These principles aim to enhance prompts in aspects like clarity, specificity, interactivity, content style, and handling complex tasks.

Key Principles:
- Improve clarity by making prompts concise, context-relevant, task-aligned, bias-avoidant.  
- Use examples, affirmative language, audience specification.  
- Engage via clarifying questions from LLM to user.
- Modulate content style directly, avoid polite language.
- Break down complex tasks into simpler prompt sequences.

Experiments and Results:
- Test principles on LLaMA and GPT models using human evaluation for quality and correctness.
- Find average 57.7% gain in quality and 67.3% in accuracy from using principles.
- Larger models benefited more from principled prompts.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive set of 26 empirically verified principles for creating better prompts.
- Significantly boosts response quality and correctness for LLMs.   
- Principles enhance interaction for users and reveal model capabilities.
- Provides guidance for researchers working on LLM prompting.

In summary, the paper tackles the challenge of effectively prompting LLMs by introducing structured principles that improve relevance, accuracy and information elicitation from LLMs across scales. The principles and experiments provide insight into stronger prompting methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces 26 principles for designing effective prompts to improve the quality and accuracy of responses from large language models across tasks and scales.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing 26 guiding principles for designing effective prompts to improve the quality and accuracy of responses from large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- The paper introduces 26 principles across 5 categories - prompt structure/clarity, specificity/information, user interaction, content/style, and complex tasks/coding. These principles provide guidance on crafting better prompts.

- It evaluates the effectiveness of using these prompt principles on various scales of LLMs - LLaMA-1/2 (7B, 13B, 70B) and GPT-3.5/4. Results show that employing the principles leads to significant improvements in response quality (57.7% boosting) and accuracy (67.3% correctness).

- The principles are more effective for larger models. Gains when moving from smaller LLaMA models to GPT-4 exceed 40% for some principles. This suggests principles help better utilize model capabilities.

- The principles and evaluation benchmark provide a methodology and guidelines for researchers/users to design prompts that can better focus LLMs and elicit quality, accurate responses.

In summary, the key contribution is a set of prompt engineering principles demonstrated to enhance LLM performance, especially for larger models. The principles and methodology simplify interacting with LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces 26 principles for prompting large language models. What motivated the authors to come up with these specific principles? How were they identified and formulated based on analyzing model behaviors?

2. The principles are grouped into 5 broad categories as shown in Table 2. What is the rationale behind this categorization? How do the categories relate to different aspects of prompting complexity?

3. Principle 5 recommends using phrases like "Explain to me like I'm 11 years old" for clarity. How does tailoring the explanation to different imagined audiences improve model performance? Were any psychological principles of communication considered here?  

4. The concept of "correctness" is used as an evaluation metric, referring to accuracy and relevance. What are some challenges in quantifying this abstract notion of correctness? How might the human judgement process introduce subjectivity?

5. What tradeoffs did the authors need to consider between conciseness versus providing sufficient context when crafting prompts? Could there be scenarios where verbosity improves responses despite the guideline favoring brevity?

6. Principle 16 suggests assigning a role to the model. How does role-playing change how the model perceives and completes tasks? Are there any risks or downsides to framing the model-user relationship this way?

7. The chain-of-thought method is recommended in Principle 19 for complex tasks. How does explicitly guiding the model through incremental steps enhance its reasoning ability compared to free generation?

8. How efficiently can these principles scale to extremely specialized domains with esoteric terminology? Would the improvements be less pronounced for niche technical questions? 

9. Beyond the quantitative metrics used, how can the subjective quality of creativity, wit, or nuanced language understanding be evaluated for model outputs?

10. What are some of the long-term societal impacts if such prompt engineering principles enter mainstream applications of large language models? Could overly engineered prompts negatively affect authenticity?
