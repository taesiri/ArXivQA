# [Principled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2,   GPT-3.5/4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Designing effective prompts/instructions to elicit high-quality responses from large language models (LLMs) can be challenging. 
- There is a need for guidelines on crafting prompts that optimize LLMs' performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces 26 principles for creating better prompts when querying different scales of LLMs. 
- These principles aim to enhance prompts in aspects like clarity, specificity, interactivity, content style, and handling complex tasks.

Key Principles:
- Improve clarity by making prompts concise, context-relevant, task-aligned, bias-avoidant.  
- Use examples, affirmative language, audience specification.  
- Engage via clarifying questions from LLM to user.
- Modulate content style directly, avoid polite language.
- Break down complex tasks into simpler prompt sequences.

Experiments and Results:
- Test principles on LLaMA and GPT models using human evaluation for quality and correctness.
- Find average 57.7% gain in quality and 67.3% in accuracy from using principles.
- Larger models benefited more from principled prompts.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive set of 26 empirically verified principles for creating better prompts.
- Significantly boosts response quality and correctness for LLMs.   
- Principles enhance interaction for users and reveal model capabilities.
- Provides guidance for researchers working on LLM prompting.

In summary, the paper tackles the challenge of effectively prompting LLMs by introducing structured principles that improve relevance, accuracy and information elicitation from LLMs across scales. The principles and experiments provide insight into stronger prompting methodology.
