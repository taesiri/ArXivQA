# [Crossing Linguistic Horizons: Finetuning and Comprehensive Evaluation of   Vietnamese Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is a lack of large language models (LLMs) specialized for the Vietnamese language, despite extensive pretraining of multilingual models. Current models exhibit limitations in effectively handling Vietnamese NLP tasks.
- There is also an absence of systematic benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for assessing Vietnamese LLM capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Fine-tune the LLaMa-2 model using the QLoRA technique on Vietnamese datasets like Wikipedia and news articles to develop performant open-source Vietnamese LLMs.  
- Build a comprehensive evaluation framework with 10 common scenarios and 31 metrics to thoroughly assess capabilities of 8 Vietnamese LLMs. New reasoning datasets are also introduced.

Key Outcomes:
- Release of 13B and 70B parameter Vietnamese LLMs demonstrating enhanced linguistic comprehension and generative abilities over smaller models.
- Analysis showing larger models introduce more biases, uncalibrated outputs, with performance heavily influenced by training data quality.  
- Evaluation framework and models open-sourced to facilitate further research into Vietnamese LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- First fine-tuning and release of 13B and 70B open-source Vietnamese LLMs.
- Comprehensive evaluation of major Vietnamese LLMs across diverse scenarios, focusing on accuracy, robustness, fairness, bias and toxicity.
- Development and release of tailored Vietnamese reasoning datasets and benchmark suite for driving future research.

In summary, the key innovation is the creation of larger-scale Vietnamese LLMs using meticulous fine-tuning and comprehensive evaluations to highlight current capabilities and room for improvement. The overall effort significantly progresses Vietnamese NLP research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents the fine-tuning and comprehensive evaluation of large Vietnamese language models across diverse tasks and metrics, introducing novel reasoning datasets and highlighting insights on model scale, datasets, and prompt engineering for performance optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The fine-tuning and release of three Vietnamese LLMs with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters based on LLaMa-2 by leveraging data from the Vietnamese Wikipedia and Vietnamese News-Corpus.

2. Conducting comprehensive evaluations of eight Vietnamese LLMs across ten common application scenarios, focusing on aspects such as accuracy, robustness, fairness, bias, and toxicity. Additional criteria are tailored to each specific scenario.

3. Introduction of two novel Vietnamese reasoning datasets inspired by MATH and Synthetic reasoning.

4. Analysis of LLM performance revealing that (i) larger language models exhibit unseen capabilities compared to smaller counterparts; (ii) larger language models tend to manifest more biases, produce uncalibrated results, and are more susceptible to the influence of input prompts; (iii) the key factor influencing LLM performance is the quality of the training or fine-tuning datasets.

The paper makes important contributions in terms of releasing new Vietnamese LLMs, establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework, constructing new datasets, and providing analysis into factors influencing LLM performance. The insights are significant for understanding how to enhance Vietnamese LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions fine-tuning LLaMa-2 models with QLoRA. Can you elaborate more on how QLoRA works and why it is suitable for fine-tuning large language models, especially in low-resource environments? 

2. When fine-tuning the LLaMa-2 variants, hyperparameters like LoRA rank, Î±, dropout etc. were kept uniform. What is the reasoning behind this? Would optimizing these hyperparameters individually lead to better performing models?

3. The evaluation encompasses 10 distinct tasks spanning various capabilities of LLMs like reasoning, knowledge, etc. What motivated the selection of these specific tasks and datasets for the comprehensive analysis? Are there any other assessment capabilities that could be relevant?  

4. Prompt engineering plays an important role in unlocking LLM performance. Can you expand more on the various prompt styles tested in the analysis - weak, medium, normal, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting? How do they target different objectives in evaluation?

5. The findings reveal larger LLMs exhibit enhanced capabilities but also manifest more biases, produce less calibrated results and get influenced more by prompts. What are the reasons behind these trade-offs? How can these be mitigated through better training strategies?

6. The results indicate that model scale alone does not determine performance, but training data quality is a key factor. What characteristics of the Wikipedia and News dataset contributed positively to LLM performance after fine-tuning? How to ensure training data itself is unbiased and balanced?

7. When testing for fairness, techniques like replacing names based on race and pronouns based on gender are utilized. Do these techniques effectively evaluate all real-world biases? What are other ways bias testing in LLMs can be made more robust?

8. The toxicity detection model employs the ViT5 architecture on UiT-ViCTSD dataset. What are the benefits of a vision-based model like ViT5? Would other architectures like LSTM give better performance in identifying textual toxicity? 

9. The analysis reveals the resilience of GPT models against typographical errors. What training strategies can induce such robustness against noisy inputs for non-GPT LLMs? Is there a tradeoff between robustness and performance?

10. The qualitative results showcase output responses across diverse tasks and models. Is there scope to add more quantitative metrics that can score these responses to allow standardized LLM benchmarking and comparisons? If so, what metrics seem suitable?
