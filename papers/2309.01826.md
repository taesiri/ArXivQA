# [One Wide Feedforward is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01826)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: What is the role and importance of the Feed Forward Network (FFN) component in Transformer models for machine translation? 

The key hypotheses explored are:

1) The FFN components contain a high degree of redundancy across layers in the encoder and decoder.

2) The FFN components, especially in the decoder, can be substantially reduced or even removed without major impacts on model accuracy.

3) The parameters from pruned FFN components can be reallocated to expand the width of the remaining FFNs, allowing the model to regain accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

So in summary, the paper investigates the redundancy and importance of FFNs through extensive experimentation with sharing, pruning, and expanding these components. The overarching goal is to understand if Transformer models can be made more parameter-efficient by rethinking the allocation of parameters from FFNs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is exploring the role of the Feed Forward Network (FFN) in Transformer models for machine translation. The key findings are:

- The FFN contains a high degree of redundancy between layers and between the encoder and decoder. This allows substantially reducing the number of parameters by sharing or removing FFNs with minimal impact on accuracy.

- Sharing a single FFN across all encoder layers and removing the decoder FFN leads to significant parameter savings and faster inference speed with only a small drop in BLEU score. 

- Increasing the dimension of the shared encoder FFN while removing the decoder FFN results in a model with similar size but improved accuracy compared to the baseline Transformer Big. This One Wide FFN model achieves gains of up to 0.9 BLEU while also being faster.

- Analysis of the internal representations shows the proposed models have high similarity to the baseline Transformer, indicating they capture similar information despite having fewer redundant parameters. 

In summary, the paper shows the FFN can be substantially reduced or shared across layers with little impact on accuracy. The proposed One Wide FFN model is a very parameter-efficient configuration that outperforms the baseline Transformer Big.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores reducing redundant parameters in the Transformer architecture for machine translation by sharing or removing the feedforward network (FFN) across encoder and decoder layers, finding that sharing a single widened FFN in the encoder and removing the decoder FFN maintains accuracy while substantially reducing parameters and latency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper explores reducing redundancy in transformer models, a topic that has been studied from other angles like pruning attention heads. This work provides a new perspective by focusing on sharing/removing feedforward networks (FFNs).

- Most prior work on parameter sharing for transformers has involved some form of layer-wise sharing, where subsets of layers share parameters. This paper shows that sharing a single FFN across all encoder layers works just as well, a more extreme form of sharing.

- While some previous papers have proposed sharing FFN parameters across encoder layers, this paper takes it further by completely removing the FFN from the decoder. Showing the decoder FFN can be removed with little accuracy drop is a novel finding.

- Many works have proposed modifications to the transformer architecture itself (e.g. replacing FFN with sparse networks). This paper sticks to the standard architecture but alters FFN sharing, making the findings broadly applicable.

- The analysis of representational similarity between models using techniques like CKA is thorough, going beyond just reporting accuracy. This provides insight into how the internal representations change with different FFN sharing schemes.

- The extensive experiments on multiple datasets, languages, and model types (multilingual, low-resource, etc) demonstrate the generality of the core findings.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive exploration of FFN redundancy in transformers, using both extensive experiments and representation analysis. The specific findings around severe FFN sharing are novel, as is the complete removal of the decoder FFN. The work builds on prior research while carving out a unique perspective on efficient transformers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Exploring ways to further reduce redundancy in Transformer models. The paper shows the FFN contains redundancy, but there may be additional opportunities to reduce redundancy in attention mechanisms or other components. Identifying and removing other redundant parts could lead to even more efficient models.

- Applying the approach of sharing/dropping FFNs to other sequence modeling tasks beyond machine translation, such as text summarization, question answering, etc. The paper focuses only on MT so it's unknown if the findings generalize. Testing on more tasks would help validate the broad applicability.

- Developing more advanced methods for sharing parameters across layers. The paper uses simple tied weights, but more sophisticated sharing approaches like conditional computation could be explored. This might allow models to adaptively determine which layers to share based on the input.

- Analyzing the effect of shared/dropped FFNs when scaling up model size and data. The paper tests mainly on base/big architectures, but it's unclear if the trends hold when going to even bigger models trained on more data.

- Studying whether redundancy reduction through FFN sharing impacts robustness or generalization. The representations may end up less redundant but it's unknown if that affects susceptibility to adversarial examples or performance on out-of-distribution data.

In summary, the main future directions are 1) finding additional avenues for redundancy reduction, 2) testing the approach on more tasks, 3) developing more advanced parameter sharing methods, and 4) understanding how it interacts with scaling and generalization. Overall the paper opens up many interesting research questions around efficient and compact Transformer design.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper explores the role of the Feed Forward Network (FFN) in Transformer models for machine translation. The authors find that the FFN contains a high degree of redundancy between layers and between the encoder and decoder. By sharing or removing the FFN across layers, they are able to substantially reduce parameters and increase inference speed with only a minor drop in BLEU score. In particular, they find sharing a single FFN across the encoder and removing the FFN entirely from the decoder performs well. Furthermore, widening this shared encoder FFN recovers the parameters and accuracy lost from sharing and dropping FFNs, and even improves upon the baseline Transformer Big model. The authors conduct similarity analyses showing the internal representations of the reduced models remain highly similar to the baseline Transformer. Overall, the paper demonstrates the FFN's redundancy and that Transformer models can be made much more efficient by appropriately sharing or removing the FFN.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores the role of the Feed Forward Network (FFN) component in Transformer models for machine translation. The FFN makes up a large portion of the model parameters, but its contribution has been less studied compared to the attention mechanism. The authors investigate whether the FFN contains redundancy across layers, and if parameters can be reduced by sharing or removing FFNs. 

They find the FFN is substantially redundant, especially in the decoder. Sharing an FFN across all encoder layers causes just a small drop in BLEU score. Removing the FFN from the decoder also has little impact. Combining parameter sharing and removal, using one shared encoder FFN and no decoder FFN reduces parameters by 41% with only a 1 BLEU loss. The authors also show this reduced model can regain the original accuracy by widening the shared encoder FFN. Overall, their proposed "One Wide FFN" model attains higher accuracy and lower latency compared to the baseline Transformer Big using a similar parameter budget. The work provides insights into the role of FFNs and how Transformer models can be made more parameter efficient.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper explores the role of the Feed Forward Network (FFN) in Transformer models for machine translation. The authors investigate the impact of sharing or removing the FFN across different layers of the encoder and decoder. In particular, they show that sharing a single FFN across all encoder layers and removing the FFN from the decoder layers leads to significant reductions in model size and increases in inference speed, with minimal impact on translation accuracy. Furthermore, the authors propose a novel model called "One Wide FFN" which uses this reduced architecture but increases the dimension of the shared encoder FFN to match the original number of parameters. This model achieves improved accuracy and latency compared to the standard Transformer Big model. The main analysis involves thorough experiments with FFN sharing and pruning on top of Transformer Big/Base architectures across several language pairs. Additionally, the authors conduct similarity analysis using CKA and LNS to compare the internal representations of the proposed architectures vs. the baseline Transformer.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the role and importance of the Feedforward Network (FFN) component in the Transformer architecture for neural machine translation. Specifically, it is investigating whether the FFN in each layer is redundant and if the parameters can be reduced or shared across layers without significantly impacting model accuracy. 

The key questions the paper seems to be exploring are:

- How important is the FFN component compared to the attention mechanism in Transformers? Can FFNs be pruned or parameters shared across layers without hurting performance much?

- Is there redundancy in the FFN components across layers? Can we share or eliminate some FFNs and still achieve comparable accuracy? 

- Can we share parameters of the FFN across the encoder and decoder modules? Are the encoder and decoder FFNs equally important?

- By sharing or eliminating FFNs, can we reduce model size and improve inference latency while maintaining accuracy?

- If we reduce FFN parameters by sharing/pruning, can we compensate by making the remaining FFN wider to regain the model capacity lost?

So in summary, the paper is analyzing the role and redundancy of FFNs in Transformers and proposing methods to reduce FFN parameters and improve efficiency while retaining model accuracy. The key goal seems to be making Transformers more compact and faster without compromising too much on quality.
