# [Proxy-based Item Representation for Attribute and Context-aware   Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06145)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel proxy-based item representation (PIR) method that represents each item as a weighted sum of learnable proxy embeddings. The motivation is to address issues with standard item embedding tables, which struggle to learn adequate representations for infrequent, long-tail items. The PIR method computes item representations compositionally based on item attributes and context, ensuring they reside inside a well-trained simplex where the vertices are proxy embeddings. This allows infrequent items to borrow training signals from frequent items in an end-to-end framework. Specifically, a neural network takes item attributes and context as input and outputs proxy weights, which are normalized via softmax and used to combine the proxy embeddings into the final item representation. An additional frequent item bias can be added to further incorporate collaborative signals for popular items. Experiments on recommendation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: the proposed PIR method consistently improves results across datasets when incorporated into existing models like BPR++, SASRec++, and CARCA. For example, the full model ProxyRCA achieves 17\% higher NDCG than prior methods on the Amazon Fashion dataset, using only 10\% of the parameters. The representations also show improved quality for infrequent items. Overall, PIR offers a plug-and-play approach to boost recommendation accuracy and address item embedding limitations.
