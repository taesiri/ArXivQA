# [Proxy-based Item Representation for Attribute and Context-aware   Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural recommendation models represent items as embeddings in a large lookup table. However, infrequent items suffer from inadequate training opportunities, resulting in poor embeddings that hurt performance. 
- The number of items grows indefinitely in real-world scenarios, leading to huge embedding tables that are inefficient in memory andcomputation.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a proxy-based item representation (PIR) that represents each item as a weighted sum of a small set of learnable proxy embeddings.
- The weights are computed from item attributes/context via a neural network and passed through a softmax to ensure the item vector lies in a simplex where the vertices are the well-trained proxy embeddings.
- For frequent items, additional learnable bias terms are added to the weights to incorporate collaborative signals. This allows learning hybrid item relationships in an end-to-end framework.

Contributions:
- PIR ensures all item vectors reside in a well-trained space to acquire guaranteed quality representations, while allowing infrequent items to borrow signals from frequent items via the shared proxies.
- Compositional item computation from proxies prevents indefinite parameter growth with new items.
- PIR can replace the item encoding layer of any sequential recommendation model in a plug-and-play manner. Experiments on multiple datasets and models show consistent significant improvements in accuracy of up to 17% while using only 10% of the parameters.
- Analysis proves properties like content locality and bias priority that explain PIR's effectiveness.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel proxy-based methodology to address key issues of huge inefficient item embeddings by representing all items compositionally inside a well-trained space for superior recommendation accuracy and efficiency.
