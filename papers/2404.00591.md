# [Task-Space Riccati Feedback based Whole Body Control for Underactuated   Legged Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Whole-body controllers (WBC) are widely used for trajectory stabilization in dynamic legged locomotion. However, their performance relies heavily on the tuning of certain parameters like task priorities and PD feedback gains. Manual tuning of these parameters is time-consuming and relies on engineering experience.

- For underactuated floating base systems like legged robots, using fixed PD gains for the floating base task is inadequate as the dynamics vary with state. The limitations imposed by underactuation and friction cone constraints are not accounted for.

Proposed Solution:
- Linearize the unactuated floating base dynamics around a reference trajectory to get a time-varying linear model. 

- Formulate a constrained finite horizon LQR with this model that incorporates friction cone constraints. Solve for the Riccati gain at each time step.

- Use the Riccati gain to construct a state feedback control law for the floating base task instead of using fixed PD gains. This considers the impact of underactuation and constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing how underactuation and friction cone constraints limit the floating base task space, which fixed PD gains fail to address.

- A method to compute time-varying feedback gains for the floating base task by formulating a constrained LQR based on the linearized model.

- Replacing fixed PD gains with the proposed Riccati feedback method in WBC improves tracking performance, as validated through simulations on a biped (up to 50% improvement) and experiments on a quadruped (up to 46% improvement).

- Reduces manual tuning effort compared to heuristic tuning of PD gains. The proposed method is model-based instead of model-free.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to systematically design the floating-base feedback gains in whole-body control for legged robots by formulating a constrained linear quadratic regulator based on a linearized model of the unactuated dynamics and friction cone constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a systematic parameter design mechanism for the floating-base feedback control within the whole-body controller (WBC) for underactuated legged locomotion. Specifically, the paper:

1) Analyzes the limitations of using user-tuned PD feedback gains for the floating-base task in WBC, showing that it fails to adequately consider the underactuation of the legged system. 

2) Formulates a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based on the linearized model of the unactuated floating-base dynamics, while incorporating physical constraints like friction cones. The resulting Riccati gain is then used to construct a new floating-base feedback law.

3) Validates the proposed approach through extensive simulations on a bipedal model and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot. Results show significant improvements in tracking performance over user-tuned methods, while also reducing tuning effort.

In summary, the key contribution is using an LQR-based systematic design to automate and enhance the floating-base feedback control in WBC for underactuated legged systems. This reduces reliance on heuristic tuning and improves tracking performance.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

The paper proposes using an LQR approach to compute a Riccati gain and construct improved floating-base feedback control for the whole-body controller of underactuated legged robots. This is compared to conventional user-tuned PD control methods. Validations are done in simulations and hardware experiments on a bipedal and a quadruped robot. The key ideas focus on accounting for the underactuated dynamics and friction cone constraints when designing the floating-base controller.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the proposed method solves a time-variant LQR at each control timestep to compute the Riccati feedback gain. What are the potential drawbacks of solving an optimization in the control loop compared to using a pre-computed gain? How can the computational efficiency be improved?

2. The friction cone constraints are approximated using a second-order Taylor expansion of the log barrier function. What impact could this approximation have on the actual satisfaction of friction cone constraints? How sensitive is the control performance to inaccuracies in the friction cone approximation?

3. The paper validates the approach using a bipedal simulation and quadruped hardware experiments. How well would you expect the methods to generalize to other legged robots like hexapods or humanoids? Would modifications be needed to handle different contact conditions?

4. The paper mentions limitations regarding deviations from the linearized trajectory. What modifications could be made to improve robustness for larger deviations or disturbances? For example, could online adaptation of the linearization be beneficial?

5. How sensitive is the control performance to inaccuracies in the model used for linearization? Could model errors lead to degradation of the computed control actions? How could this be addressed?

6. What impact does the selection of cost function matrices Q and R have on the resulting Riccati feedback gain and control performance? How should these matrices be selected appropriately?

7. The paper uses a commercially available quadruped robot for validation. What additional experiments could provide more insight into the advantages and limitations of the method? For example, testing on more dynamic motions.

8. The paper focuses only on feedback control of the floating base. How suitable would the proposed method be for other operational space tasks like foot trajectory control? What modifications would need to be made?

9. What effect does the discretization time step used in the LQR formulation have on the control performance? Is there an optimal time step that balances complexity and performance?

10. The paper mentions replanning for handling larger deviations from the trajectory. How frequently would replanning need to be performed to maintain stability and performance for highly dynamic motions? What is the limit of disturbance that can be handled before failure?
