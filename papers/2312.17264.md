# [ESGReveal: An LLM-based approach for extracting structured data from ESG   reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Extracting accurate and consistent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data from corporate reports is challenging due to the vast number of reports in varied formats. This limits effective ESG performance analysis and disclosure at the corporate and industry level.  

Proposed Solution - ESGReveal:
The paper proposes ESGReveal, an approach that utilizes large language models (LLMs) and retrieval augmented generation to systematically extract structured ESG data from reports. ESGReveal has 3 key components:

1. ESG Metadata Module: Defines query framework per ESG reporting standards e.g. entities, extensions, expressions. This adapts the system across standards.

2. Report Preprocessing Module: Imports and processes ESG reports to build a searchable database for the LLM agent module. Structures texts, outlines, tables.  

3. LLM Agent Module: Retrieves report data using similarity search over ESG metadata vectors. Feeds prompts with retrieved data to GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGLM for data extraction.

Main Contributions:  

1. Designed and implemented ESGReveal for extracting crucial ESG indicators and actions from reports systematically.  

2. Evaluated performance of different LLMs on analyzing ESG disclosures. GPT-4 achieved 76.9% data extraction accuracy and 83.7% disclosure analysis accuracy.

3. Analyzed ESG reports of 166 major HKEX-listed firms using ESGReveal. Found average environmental disclosure at 69.5% and social disclosure at 57.2% indicating need for more transparency.

In summary, the paper demonstrates ESGReveal's efficacy in improving accuracy of analyzing ESG reporting practices using latest LLMs. Analysis of HKEX company reports reveals areas for enhancing sustainability performance transparency across industries.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces ESGReveal, a novel LLM and RAG-based approach for extracting structured environmental, social, and governance data from corporate reports, evaluates its performance in analyzing ESG disclosures of Hong Kong-listed companies across sectors, and reveals room for improvement in disclosure practices as well as common and industry-specific ESG actions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this research include:

1. Designing and executing ESGReveal for systematic extraction of crucial numerical and textual data from corporate ESG reports.

2. Assessing the performance of different large language models in ESG information retrieval, setting a baseline for further ESG data processing and analytical studies.

3. Utilizing ESGReveal to evaluate ESG reports from a representative subset of companies on the HKEx, providing industry benchmarks for ESG conduct and reporting.

In summary, the paper introduces a new method called ESGReveal for extracting structured data from ESG reports using large language models, evaluates the performance of different LLMs on this task, and applies the method to analyze ESG reporting practices of companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the ESGReveal method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions enhancing the adaptability of ESGReveal across diverse ESG reporting standards. What specific steps could be taken to improve the flexibility of the ESG metadata module to incorporate additional emerging ESG frameworks? 

2. The accuracy analysis reveals a consistent gap between disclosure coverage ($Acc_{DC}$) and data extraction ($Acc_{DE}$) across the benchmarked LLMs. What factors could explain this discrepancy and how can the model architecture be refined to minimize it?

3. How exactly does incorporating domain knowledge in the ESG metadata module lead to significant performance gains for LLMs with weaker comprehension capacities like GPT-3.5? What modifications to the knowledge integration approach can further boost accuracy?

4. The paper analyzes average disclosure rates across industries but does not examine variance within sectors. What statistical analyses could reveal useful industry-specific insights into disclosure rate distributions?  

5. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission trends are analyzed across sectors. How can the model be extended to systematically extract Scope 3 emissions data as well and identify reduction opportunities in supply chains?

6. Pictorial data extraction is stated as a limitation. What techniques can augment multimodal, visual information extraction from ESG reports? How will this impact analysis accuracy?

7. The paper suggests industry-specific ESG datasets could enhance analysis granularity. What methods can enable customized, automated dataset development per sector to power accurate, tailored assessments?

8. Real-world validation requires applying ESGReveal across reports globally, not just Hong Kong firms. What cross-cultural model refinement is needed to handle multilingual reports effectively?

9. How exactly does more effective document structuring and information retrieval in the enhanced RAG framework translate to gains of over 20% in analysis accuracy?

10. The paper suggests expanding ESGReveal's scope to climate-related documents. What are the additional technological and data challenges involved? How specifically can the modular architecture be leveraged?
