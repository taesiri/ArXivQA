## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have potential for improved computational efficiency but current neuromorphic chips have limitations in flexibility of neural models, synapse density to support large-scale SNNs, and on-chip learning capabilities. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new neuromorphic chip called Darwin3 with the following main contributions:

1) A domain-specific instruction set architecture (ISA) that can efficiently describe diverse spiking neuron models and learning rules. It has 10 core instructions and some extended instructions.

2) A novel connectivity compression mechanism to represent SNN topology that significantly reduces memory usage for synaptic connections. It achieves up to 4096x neuron core fan-in and 3072x fan-out improvement compared to physical memory depth.

3) The Darwin3 chip architecture uses a 2D mesh of computing nodes. It supports up to 2.35 million neurons, making it the largest neuromorphic chip in terms of neuron scale. 

4) Experiments show the ISA provides 2.2x-28.3x code density advantage over other chips. Darwin3 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and latency when benchmarked on typical SNN applications, both for inference and on-device learning.

5) Two large-scale applications demonstrated: spiking VGG-16 ensembling with 1.05 million neurons and directly-trained SNN for maze solving with up to 2.35 million neurons, showing practical effectiveness.

In summary, the paper introduces a new neuromorphic chip called Darwin3 with innovations in its ISA and connectivity compression to achieve much improved flexibility, synapse density and on-chip learning capabilities compared to prior art. Extensive experiments validate its state-of-the-art performance.
