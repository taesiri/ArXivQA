# A Benchmark for Understanding and Generating Dialogue between Characters   in Stories

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: Can machines understand and generate dialogue between characters in stories? Specifically, the authors aim to explore whether computational models can capture the traits of different characters and the relationships between them in order to understand and generate coherent and natural dialogue that advances story plots. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling character representations will improve machine performance on understanding and generating dialogue in stories.To test this, the authors propose two new tasks:1) Masked Dialogue Generation: Generating coherent missing dialogue turns in a story given context. 2) Dialogue Speaker Recognition: Predicting the speaker of a dialogue turn from candidate characters.They construct a new Chinese story dataset with annotated dialogues to support evaluation of these tasks. Their proposed model incorporates learned character representations and is shown to outperform baselines on both tasks.In summary, the central research question is whether machines can properly understand and generate inter-character dialogue to advance story plots, which requires capturing relationships between characters. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling character representations helps address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposes two new tasks for understanding and generating dialogue in stories: Masked Dialogue Generation and Dialogue Speaker Recognition.- Introduces a new dataset called DialStory containing 105k Chinese stories with a large amount of dialogue.- Shows the difficulty of the proposed tasks by testing existing models with automatic and manual evaluation. - Proposes to learn explicit character representations to improve performance on these tasks. Experiments show this approach can generate more coherent and informative dialogue, and achieve higher speaker recognition accuracy.- Provides benchmark datasets, tasks and models to spur research in understanding and generating dialogue between characters in stories.In summary, the paper presents the first comprehensive study on modeling dialogue between characters in stories, including new tasks, dataset, models and experiments. The key idea is to learn representations of story characters to better capture their traits and relationships for dialogue generation and understanding.
