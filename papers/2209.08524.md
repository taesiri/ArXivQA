# [A Benchmark for Understanding and Generating Dialogue between Characters   in Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08524)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: Can machines understand and generate dialogue between characters in stories? 

Specifically, the authors aim to explore whether computational models can capture the traits of different characters and the relationships between them in order to understand and generate coherent and natural dialogue that advances story plots. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling character representations will improve machine performance on understanding and generating dialogue in stories.

To test this, the authors propose two new tasks:

1) Masked Dialogue Generation: Generating coherent missing dialogue turns in a story given context. 

2) Dialogue Speaker Recognition: Predicting the speaker of a dialogue turn from candidate characters.

They construct a new Chinese story dataset with annotated dialogues to support evaluation of these tasks. Their proposed model incorporates learned character representations and is shown to outperform baselines on both tasks.

In summary, the central research question is whether machines can properly understand and generate inter-character dialogue to advance story plots, which requires capturing relationships between characters. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling character representations helps address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposes two new tasks for understanding and generating dialogue in stories: Masked Dialogue Generation and Dialogue Speaker Recognition.

- Introduces a new dataset called DialStory containing 105k Chinese stories with a large amount of dialogue.

- Shows the difficulty of the proposed tasks by testing existing models with automatic and manual evaluation. 

- Proposes to learn explicit character representations to improve performance on these tasks. Experiments show this approach can generate more coherent and informative dialogue, and achieve higher speaker recognition accuracy.

- Provides benchmark datasets, tasks and models to spur research in understanding and generating dialogue between characters in stories.

In summary, the paper presents the first comprehensive study on modeling dialogue between characters in stories, including new tasks, dataset, models and experiments. The key idea is to learn representations of story characters to better capture their traits and relationships for dialogue generation and understanding.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two new dialogue-focused NLP tasks, Masked Dialogue Generation and Dialogue Speaker Recognition, as well as a new Chinese story dataset called DialStory to support research on understanding and generating dialogue between characters in stories.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key things to note about how this paper compares to other research in dialogue generation and understanding for stories:

- This is the first paper to specifically focus on character dialogue in stories, proposing two new tasks - masked dialogue generation and dialogue speaker recognition. Most prior work has focused on broader story generation or dialogue in other domains like conversational AI.

- The paper introduces a new large-scale Chinese story dataset, DialStory, with over 100k stories and automatic annotations of dialogue turns and speakers. This provides a strong foundation for research on these new tasks. Many existing story datasets are smaller or do not have dialogue annotations.

- The proposed tasks aim to assess a model's ability to capture character traits, emotions, motivations, and relationships for dialogue generation and understanding. This is a unique goal compared to typical dialogue tasks which often focus on general chit-chat abilities. 

- The authors propose learning explicit character representations from story context to improve performance on the tasks. Other related work has dynamically updated states but not derived standalone character representations.

- Experiments demonstrate the difficulty of the tasks for strong dialogue/language models like BART, and show the benefits of the proposed character modeling approach. Both automatic metrics and human evaluation are used.

- There is still room for improvement on the tasks using the introduced dataset, especially to address some common errors like contradiction and repetition. The character representations could also potentially be enhanced further.

Overall, the novel tasks, dataset, and modeling approach significantly advance research on character dialogue in stories. The comprehensive benchmark and analysis push forward this new subfield of dialogue research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some potential future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Dynamically updating character representations during story generation. The authors currently derive static character representations from the input text, but mention it could be beneficial to update these dynamically as the story plot develops.

- Expanding the dataset for the Dialogue Speaker Recognition (DialSpk) task. The authors note the dataset for evaluating story-level accuracy on this task is small, so expanding it could enable more thorough evaluation.

- Exploring the proposed tasks and models on more complex AI interactive games/stories beyond the current datasets. The tasks and character modeling approaches could extend to multi-party conversational AI systems.

- Improving story coherence by addressing the different error types (e.g. inter-sentence repetition) that both the proposed model and baselines exhibit. The authors provide quantitative analysis of these errors to motivate future improvement.

- Generalizing the character modeling techniques to other languages and story datasets. The current work focuses on Chinese stories, but the ideas could likely transfer to other languages as well.

- Combining the character representations with other conditional story generation techniques like controlling personalities, emotions, plot outlines etc. The character representations could complement these other methods.

In summary, the main future directions center around expanding the datasets, generalizing the approach to new domains/languages, dynamically updating character representations during generation, and improving story coherence.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper presents the first study on understanding and generating dialogue between characters in stories. The authors collected a dataset of 105k Chinese stories containing a large amount of dialogue woven into the plots. They proposed two new tasks to assess models' capabilities in this area: Masked Dialogue Generation, which involves generating missing dialogue turns in a story, and Dialogue Speaker Recognition, which involves predicting the speaker for specified dialogue turns. To improve performance on these tasks, the authors proposed learning explicit character representations from the story plots to capture dependencies between characters and dialogue. Experiments showed their approach could generate more coherent and informative dialogue, and achieved higher speaker recognition accuracy compared to strong baselines. Limitations were the small dataset size for full story speaker recognition evaluation. Overall, the benchmark tasks, dataset and models presented aim to spur further research on understanding and generating dialogue in narratives.

In summary, the key points are:
- The paper introduces two new tasks, Masked Dialogue Generation and Dialogue Speaker Recognition, for evaluating models on understanding and generating dialogue within stories.
- A new Chinese story dataset containing 105k stories with dialogue was collected to support evaluation.
- Learning explicit character representations improved performance on the tasks compared to baselines.
- There are limitations around the small dataset size for full story speaker recognition. 
- The benchmark tasks and resources aim to promote more research on modelling dialogue in narratives.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes learning representations of different characters in a story and utilizing these representations to improve performance on dialogue generation and understanding tasks. Specifically, the character representations are derived by aggregating encoder hidden states corresponding to all mentions of each character using mean pooling. For the masked dialogue generation task, these character representations are combined with decoder hidden states to select the appropriate character when generating each token. For the dialogue speaker recognition task, the character representations are compared to dialogue turn representations using cosine similarity to predict speakers. By modeling characters explicitly, the proposed approach outperforms baselines without character modeling on both automatic metrics and human evaluation for the two dialogue tasks. The main novelty of the method is in learning standalone character representations from the story context and leveraging them to improve dialogue coherence and speaker recognition.
