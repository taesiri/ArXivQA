# [Multi-scale Dynamic and Hierarchical Relationship Modeling for Facial   Action Units Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Facial action units (AUs) exhibit hierarchical inter-dependencies - AUs in same/close facial regions have stronger relationships than AUs in different regions.
- Different AUs show heterogeneity in range and magnitude of facial muscle movements.
- Existing methods do not thoroughly model these properties of AUs. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Multi-scale Facial Dynamic Modelling (MFD) module
   - Captures AU-related facial dynamics across frames at different spatial scales.
   - Considers heterogeneity in ranges and magnitudes of different AUs.
   - Emphasizes subtle and obvious motions using adaptive weighting.

- Hierarchical Spatio-temporal AU Relationship Modelling (HSR) module
   - Models AU relationships hierarchically in two stages:
      1) Local AU relationship modelling - for AUs within same facial region
      2) Cross-regional modelling - for AUs across different facial regions
   - Allows learning region-specific and global relationships among AUs
   
Main Contributions:
- First module (MFD) that adaptively considers facial dynamics specific to each AU
- First module (HSR) that hierarchically models local and cross-regional spatio-temporal AU relationships
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on BP4D and DISFA benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness of proposed ideas

In summary, the paper proposes an end-to-end framework with complementary modules to capture subtle facial dynamics and hierarchical relationships among action units in spatial and temporal dimensions. The ideas are validated through comprehensive experiments and results.
