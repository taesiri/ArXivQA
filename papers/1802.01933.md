# [A Survey Of Methods For Explaining Black Box Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01933)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

- How to define and categorize the different problems related to explaining and interpreting black box machine learning models? The paper identifies four main problem categories: black box model explanation, black box outcome explanation, black box inspection, and transparent box design.

- How to classify the existing methods proposed in the literature for "opening the black box" according to the problem addressed, the type of explanator used, the black box model explained, and the data type? The paper proposes a classification scheme along these dimensions. 

- What are the open challenges and research questions that still need to be addressed when it comes to interpreting black box models? The paper highlights several open issues, including the lack of agreement on what constitutes an "explanation", the need to quantify explanation comprehensibility, dealing with latent features, explaining recommendations, and learning from explanations.

So in summary, the main research goals appear to be: 1) clearly defining the space of black box explanation problems, 2) systematically organizing the existing literature based on the problem, explanator, model, and data type, and 3) outlining the limitations of current work and open questions that require further research. The classification scheme and literature review seem aimed at achieving a more structured understanding of this emerging research area.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several areas for future research directions, including:

- Defining a formalism and general properties for explanations: The authors argue that there is currently no agreement on what constitutes an "explanation" in machine learning models. They suggest defining a formal mathematical framework and identifying key properties that explanations should satisfy (e.g. soundness, completeness, compactness, comprehensibility). 

- Quantifying comprehensibility of explanations: The authors point out the lack of work on quantifying how understandable an explanation is for humans. They suggest developing measures that account for factors like user expertise and time available.

- Explanations with latent features: Current work assumes the features used by a model are known, but black boxes may use additional latent features. The authors suggest investigating how to generate explanations when decisions involve unknown features.

- Explanations in recommender systems: When suggestions are made to users, the authors argue the reasons behind recommendations should also be provided. They point to initial work in case-based recommendation explanations.

- Learning predictors from explanations: The authors suggest explanations could be leveraged directly for training models rather than raw data, pointing to initial work training a game agent from explanations.

- Avoiding artifacts in prototype-based explanations: For methods that use prototypes or archetypes, especially for neural networks, the authors warn about the risk of artifacts that don't generalize or reflect natural data. They suggest explanations should maximize generalization and avoid atypical artificial inputs.

In summary, the authors highlight the need for a more rigorous theory of explanations, developing quantifiable measures of interpretability, and caution about overfitting explanations to artifacts and peculiarities of black box models. They point to several interesting research directions like handling unknown features and learning directly from explanations.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive review and classification of methods for explaining and interpreting machine learning models that act as "black boxes", where the reasoning behind their predictions is opaque. The authors identify and formally define four key problems related to opening up black boxes: explaining the overall model logic (global interpretability), explaining individual predictions (local interpretability), visually inspecting model mechanisms, and designing inherently interpretable models. They categorize approaches from the literature based on the problem addressed, the type of explanation provided (e.g. decision trees, rules, feature importance), the model being explained (neural networks, random forests, etc.), and the data type (tabular, image, text). Some key findings are that most methods are model-specific rather than generalizable, there is no consensus on what constitutes a good explanation, and there remain open questions around formally defining explanations, measuring human interpretability, and explaining models with latent features. The analysis provides a useful framework and checklist for approaching model interpretability issues in a principled way tailored to different use cases.
