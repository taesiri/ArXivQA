## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Camera Parameter Free Neural Radiance Fields (CF-NeRF) for estimating camera parameters and reconstructing 3D scenes from image sequences without any prior information. Unlike previous NeRF-based methods that estimate all camera parameters simultaneously, CF-NeRF takes an incremental approach inspired by traditional incremental structure from motion pipelines. It first initializes camera parameters and NeRF weights using a few images, then gradually estimates the parameters for each new image through implicit localization and implicit optimization steps. The localization step provides an initial estimate for the new image's camera which is then refined along with all previous camera parameters during optimization to minimize drift. Experiments on real-world rotation datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose accuracy and view synthesis compared to other NeRF methods. Key benefits are not needing any priors or constraints on poses while still robustly handling complex trajectories. The method highlights the potential of NeRF scene representations and differentiable rendering for self-supervised end-to-end reconstruction from images.
