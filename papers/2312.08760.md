# [CF-NeRF: Camera Parameter Free Neural Radiance Fields with Incremental   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08760)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Camera Parameter Free Neural Radiance Fields (CF-NeRF) for estimating camera parameters and reconstructing 3D scenes from image sequences without any prior information. Unlike previous NeRF-based methods that estimate all camera parameters simultaneously, CF-NeRF takes an incremental approach inspired by traditional incremental structure from motion pipelines. It first initializes camera parameters and NeRF weights using a few images, then gradually estimates the parameters for each new image through implicit localization and implicit optimization steps. The localization step provides an initial estimate for the new image's camera which is then refined along with all previous camera parameters during optimization to minimize drift. Experiments on real-world rotation datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose accuracy and view synthesis compared to other NeRF methods. Key benefits are not needing any priors or constraints on poses while still robustly handling complex trajectories. The method highlights the potential of NeRF scene representations and differentiable rendering for self-supervised end-to-end reconstruction from images.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods rely on complex traditional pipelines like COLMAP to provide camera parameters as input. Recent works try to jointly estimate radiance field and camera poses, but are limited to simple forward-looking motions. They fail on complex rotations in real scenes.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a camera parameter free neural radiance field method (CF-NeRF) that can incrementally reconstruct radiance field and recover camera parameters for images, without needing any prior camera information or constraints.

The key ideas are:
1) Follow incremental structure from motion (SfM) to estimate camera parameters one image at a time instead of jointly. This avoids getting trapped in bad local optima.

2) Three main modules - Initialization, Implicit Localization and Implicit Optimization:
- Initialization: Estimate radiance field and camera for first few images.
- Localization: For each new image, initialize camera parameter and optimize it. 
- Optimization: Refine parameters of new and previous images to reduce drift. Includes partial (recent frames) and global (all frames) optimization.

3) Coarse-to-fine strategy for more robust training.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes an end-to-end differentiable method CF-NeRF to simultaneously reconstruct neural radiance field and estimate camera parameters without any prior information.

2) Designs an incremental training procedure inspired by incremental SfM to make it suitable for complex real-world trajectories and avoid bad local optima.

3) Evaluates extensively on real-world dataset NeRFBuster with complex motions including rotations. CF-NeRF outperforms recent methods by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness.

The summary covers the key problem addressed, the main ideas of the proposed CF-NeRF solution and training strategy, and the key contributions validated through experiments on a challenging real-world dataset. Please let me know if any part needs more explanation or clarification.
