# [Boosting Conversational Question Answering with Fine-Grained   Retrieval-Augmentation and Self-Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18243)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational question answering (CQA) is challenging as the questions are dependent on the conversation history and topics may frequently switch. 
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from hallucination problems and generate factual errors, which are not reliable for knowledge-intensive CQA questions.
- Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods focus on single-round QA, how to effectively perform RAG to boost CQA has not been well studied.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a conversation-level RAG approach called ConvRAG, which incorporates fine-grained retrieval augmentation and self-check to boost CQA.
- It has three components:
   1) Conversational question refiner: Performs question reformulation and keyword extraction based on context for better understanding.
   2) Fine-grained retriever: Retrieves most relevant paragraphs from Webs as evidence.
   3) Self-check based response generator: Checks helpfulness of retrieved paragraphs and selectively utilizes them with LLM to generate response.

Main Contributions:
- Construct a Chinese CQA dataset with new features like reformulated questions, keywords, retrieved paragraphs and their helpfulness.
- Explore potential of RAG in conversation level, propose ConvRAG approach to boost CQA. 
- Three components effectively resolve challenges of question representation and knowledge acquisition for CQA.
- Experiments show superiority over state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a conversation-level retrieval-augmented generation approach called ConvRAG that incorporates fine-grained retrieval augmentation and self-check to boost conversational question answering by better understanding context-dependent questions, acquiring relevant knowledge, and filtering unhelpful retrieved information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors construct a Chinese CQA dataset extending with new features including reformulated question, extracted keyword, retrieved paragraphs and their helpfulness. This dataset helps promote research in RAG enhanced CQA.

2. The authors propose ConvRAG, which integrates large language models with retrieval-augmented generation at the conversation level to boost conversational question answering. ConvRAG consists of three main components - conversational question refiner, fine-grained retriever, and self-check based response generator.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConvRAG over advanced baselines on benchmark and constructed datasets. The ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of each component in ConvRAG.

In summary, the main contributions are the constructed dataset to facilitate RAG research for CQA, the proposed ConvRAG approach to integrate fine-grained retrieval augmentation and self-check with LLMs for boosting CQA performance, and experimental verification of the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Conversational Question Answering (CQA)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
- Large language models (LLMs)

The paper proposes an approach called Conversation-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ConvRAG) to boost conversational question answering. The key ideas include using fine-grained retrieval to obtain relevant information from the web to augment language models, as well as a self-check mechanism to filter unhelpful information. The approach also involves reformulating questions and extracting keywords to better understand context-dependent questions in conversations. A goal is to reduce factual errors and hallucinations in language models for more accurate response generation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a conversational question refiner module. What specific techniques are used for question reformulation and keyword extraction in this module? How do these techniques help improve question understanding in a conversational setting?

2. The fine-grained retriever module retrieves relevant paragraphs from the web. What techniques are used for document-level retrieval, paragraph-level recall, and paragraph-level reranking? Why is a multi-stage retrieval process needed? 

3. The self-check mechanism in the response generator checks if the retrieved paragraphs are helpful before using them to generate the response. What is the motivation behind having this mechanism? How does it help improve the quality of the generated response?

4. The method is evaluated on both seen (benchmark test set) and unseen (newly constructed test set) conversational topics. Why is evaluation on an unseen test set important for assessing generalization capability in conversational QA?

5. What language model architecture is used for the different modules like question reformulation, keyword extraction, and response generation? Why is that specific architecture suitable?

6. How does the proposed conversational-level retrieval augmented generation (ConvRAG) method compare with previous retrieval augmented methods for single-turn QA in terms of the retrieval process?

7. What findings from the ablation studies highlight the importance of different components like the question refiner and retriever modules? How do they contribute to the overall performance?

8. The newly constructed Chinese conversational QA dataset has additional annotations like reformulated questions, keywords etc. How can the availability of such extra annotations further research in this area?

9. What are some limitations of the current method? How can the method be extended or improved further to handle more complex conversational settings?

10. The paper focuses on integrating large language models with retrieval augmentation for conversational QA. What other external knowledge sources beyond retrieval could be incorporated to further boost performance?
