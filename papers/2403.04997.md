# [DiffChat: Learning to Chat with Text-to-Image Synthesis Models for   Interactive Image Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04997)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-image synthesis (TIS) models can generate realistic images from text prompts, but writing good prompts is difficult, requiring iterative trial-and-error. 
- Non-experts struggle to craft appropriate prompts to create desired images. Minor prompt changes often result in unpredictable output.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose \textit{DiffChat}, a novel method to align large language models (LLMs) to "chat" with TIS models like Stable Diffusion for interactive image creation.
- \textit{DiffChat} can effectively modify prompts based on raw prompts/images and user instructions to generate improved prompts and images.

Key Contributions:

1. Propose \textit{DiffChat} framework to collaborate with off-the-shelf TIS models through "chatting" for easy interactive image creation. Shows superior performance over baselines.

2. Release new prompt engineering dataset \textbf{InstructPE} with 234k train and 5.5k test examples for supervised pre-training.

3. Apply reinforcement learning with aesthetic, preference and content integrity feedback for enhanced training without human labeling. 

4. Introduce action-space dynamic modification (ADM) technique to obtain better quality samples. Add content integrity into value estimation for improved state understanding.

5. Show strong results on automatic metrics and human evaluations. Demonstrate transferability by applying \textit{DiffChat} prompts to various TIS models like Stable Diffusion series.

In summary, \textit{DiffChat} allows non-experts to easily guide image creation through conversational instructions instead of manual prompt engineering. The framework is model-agnostic and works effectively with different existing TIS models.
