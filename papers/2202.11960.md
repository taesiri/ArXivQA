# [All You Need Is Supervised Learning: From Imitation Learning to Meta-RL   With Upside Down RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11960)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can a single upside down reinforcement learning (UDRL) algorithm and architecture be effective across various reinforcement learning settings, including online RL, imitation learning, offline RL, goal-conditioned RL, and meta-RL?The key hypothesis is that by framing RL as a supervised learning problem and using an architecture that can handle arbitrary structured inputs/outputs, a single UDRL agent can learn effectively across different RL paradigms without needing specialized algorithms. The paper aims to demonstrate that the upside down approach, where the RL return is used as an input instead of an objective, allows bypassing issues like bootstrapping and off-policy corrections. Using a recurrent architecture and flexible input commands, the authors propose that the same general UDRL algorithm can work in online RL, imitation learning, offline RL, goal-conditioned RL, and meta-RL settings. The central research question is whether this unified UDRL approach can be effective across such diverse settings with a single algorithm and architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a general framework for reinforcement learning called Upside Down RL (UDRL) that is based purely on supervised learning. The key ideas of UDRL are:- The policy network is trained to predict actions conditioned on "command" inputs that specify the desired return/goal. This allows training the policy with standard supervised learning, avoiding issues like bootstrapping errors.- A single UDRL agent and algorithm can work across different RL settings like online RL, imitation learning, offline RL, goal-conditioned RL, and meta-RL by using different command formulations. - Using a general architecture like a Transformer allows the UDRL agent to deal with different inputs/outputs and thus handle partially observed and goal-conditioned environments.- The efficacy of UDRL depends on the dataset used for training and the command formulation. The agent can be trained on its own experience or demonstration data. The commands allow flexible credit assignment.The authors demonstrate a UDRL agent working decently across different RL settings on a CartPole task using the same model, showing the potential of this simplified supervised approach to RL. The hope is that UDRL provides a simpler platform to build general learning agents.
