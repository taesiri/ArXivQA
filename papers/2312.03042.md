## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions adjusting parameters to control the complexity of the problems in the dataset. What specific parameters were adjusted and how did adjusting them affect the complexity? 

2. In the 2D route planning experiments, what considerations went into generating the grid database? How were the grid dimensions and obstacle ratios determined?

3. The paper excludes certain obstacle ratios for smaller grid sizes in the 2D experiments. What was the rationale behind excluding these ratios and how might including them have impacted the results?

4. For the 3D route planning experiments, what additional complexities did extending the approach to 3D space introduce compared to the 2D version? How did the authors account for these?

5. The paper concludes GPT-4 performed better at 2D route planning compared to 3D. What factors may have contributed to this difference in performance? 

6. In the spatial point plotting experiments, how were the grid sizes, point ratios and density of points determined? What was the thought process there?

7. The spatial point plotting experiments reveal limitations in GPT-4's abilities for larger grid sizes and point ratios. What modifications could be made to the approach to overcome these limitations?

8. For all three experiments, was any additional information provided in the prompts to GPT-4 beyond what is mentioned in the paper? If so, what was included and why?

9. The paper mentions using code to automatically verify GPT-4's outputs. Can you provide more detail on how this verification was implemented across the three different experiments? 

10. The conclusion mentions the dataset may be too specific to capture all aspects of spatial reasoning. What are some examples of spatial reasoning tasks that should be considered in future work to address this?
