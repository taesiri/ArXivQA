# [FGeo-HyperGNet: Geometry Problem Solving Integrating Formal Symbolic   System and Hypergraph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Geometry problem solving (GPS) is a long-standing challenge in mathematical reasoning and AI due to the cross-modal nature of geometric knowledge and lack of automated solving methods. Existing methods have limitations - symbolic approaches lack scalability and traceability; probabilistic approaches lack interpretability and correctness guarantees. There is a need for an integrated framework that can perform reliable geometric reasoning while providing interpretable and verifiable solutions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a neural-symbolic architecture that combines a neural theorem proposer with a symbolic theorem applier:

- The neural part (HyperGNet) is a hypergraph neural network that encodes the problem state (conditions, goals) as a solution hypertree and predicts candidate theorems to progress the solution. It uses a hypergraph encoder to capture structural and semantic information and a decoder to focus on problem-solving-relevant information.

- The symbolic part is a formal system (built on FormalGeo) that can construct problems as hypertrees, formally validate and apply predicted theorems to update the state, and perform geometric reasoning to obtain solutions.  

Together, these components enable an interactive predict-apply cycle that incrementally constructs a readable, traceable solving path.

Key Contributions:

- Proposal of a neural-symbolic architecture for interpretable and verifiable GPS
- Introduction of the Predict-Apply Cycle (PAC) outlining the neural-symbolic interaction
- Development of HyperGNet, a hypergraph neural network, to encode and solve based on solution hypertrees   
- Creation of an extensible symbolic system using FormalGeo language
- Experiments demonstrating accuracy improvements over baselines through guided search
- Ablations validating design decisions like pretraining and hypertree encoding

The integrated system combines neural efficiency and reasoning transparency, advancing progress towards human-like automated geometry problem solving.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a neural-symbolic architecture that combines a hypergraph neural network to predict theorems with a formal symbolic system to apply theorems, forming a predict-apply cycle to achieve automatic and interpretable solving of plane geometry problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a neural-symbolic architecture for automatic geometric problem solving. The neural part learns how to solve problems from experience and predicts the general direction, while the symbolic part performs strict reasoning to ensure correctness. The predict-apply cycle (PAC) clarifies the interaction between these two parts.

2. Achieving good experimental results on the formalgeo7k dataset, with a step-wise accuracy of 87.65% and overall accuracy of 85.53%. Ablation experiments are also conducted on the HyperGNet model.

3. Modeling the problem-solving process as a hypertree with conditions as nodes and theorems as edges. The symbolic system can construct this traceable and interpretable hypertree. 

4. Proposing HyperGNet, a hypergraph neural network based on attention mechanisms, to effectively encode the structural and semantic information of the hypertree and provide problem-solving guidance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a combined neural-symbolic architecture that utilizes the strengths of both deep learning and formal logical systems to achieve automatic, traceable and verifiable geometric problem solving.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions utilizing the convergence effect of attention mechanisms to achieve variable-length sentence embedding. Can you explain in more detail the intuition behind this idea and how the removal of residual connections enables this convergence effect? 

2. The Predict-Apply Cycle seems critical to the integration of the neural and symbolic components. Can you walk through an example PAC iteration and how specifically the neural prediction influences the symbolic application?

3. HyperGNet adopts an encoder-decoder structure. What were the considerations in designing the encoder versus the decoder? Why was the decoder made task-specific?

4. How exactly does HyperGNet leverage both the structural and semantic properties of the geometric formal language? What types of information does each contribute to the model's predictive abilities?

5. Could you discuss the methodology behind constructing the training data pairs of (hypertree state, applicable theorems)? This seems non-trivial given the underlying graph structure.

6. The paper categorizes geometric problem difficulty using theorem sequence lengths. Are there other potential ways to categorize difficulty that may provide more nuance?

7. The formal geometric system is built on top of FormalGeo. What are 1-2 key capabilities this enables over past formal systems for geometry problem solving? 

8. One could imagine replacing the symbolic system with more modern neural approaches as well. What unique challenges exist in 'neuralizing' the formal geometric reasoning necessary for verifiable GPS?

9. How does your method account for multiple possible theorem application orders or sequences that lead to a problem solution? Does search play an important role?

10. An important aspect of mathematical problem solving is generalizability. How does the incorporation of formal domain knowledge aid the model in applying known theorems to novel problem configurations or diagram substructures?
