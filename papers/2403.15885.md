# [STEntConv: Predicting Disagreement with Stance Detection and a Signed   Graph Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The rise of social media has led to increased polarization in online discussions on political and socio-cultural topics. Detecting disagreement between users can help assess controversy around a topic and gain insights into user opinions. 
- Most prior work relies on platform-specific features like tweets and hashtags which cannot generalize across platforms. No previous work has used user-entity stances to model disagreement.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes an unsupervised method called STEntConv to predict disagreement between comment-reply posts by modeling user stances towards named entities.  
- It extracts named entities from posts and calculates user stances towards them using sentence-BERT embeddings. A signed user-entity graph is constructed weighted by stances.
- A Signed Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) is trained on this graph concatenated with BERT embeddings of the posts to detect disagreement.

Main Contributions:
- Unsupervised extraction of user stances towards entities using sentence-BERT
- Construction of a weighted signed user-entity graph 
- STEntConv model using SGCN on user-entity graph and BERT on posts to outperform baselines in detecting disagreement
- Ablation studies demonstrating contribution of components
- Approach is platform-agnostic, does not need user history and explains disagreement via traceable user-entity allegiances

In summary, the key innovation is using unsupervised user-entity stances to create signed graph representations indicative of polarization and disagreement. The proposed STEntConv model outperforms baselines on a Reddit dataset and provides more explainability. As it does not rely on platform-specific features, it offers a generalizable approach to disagreement detection in online discussions.
