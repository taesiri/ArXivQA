# [Towards the Generalization of Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00743)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: What are the key factors that determine the generalization ability of contrastive self-supervised learning methods? More specifically, the authors aim to theoretically characterize and understand:1) The role of data augmentation in contrastive SSL.2) How different contrastive losses like InfoNCE and cross-correlation provably achieve good alignment and divergence of representations, which are identified as key factors for generalization. 3) The relationship between the concentration of augmented data and downstream task performance.The central hypothesis seems to be that the generalization ability of contrastive SSL is determined by three key factors: alignment of positive samples, divergence of class centers, and concentration of augmented data. The paper provides theoretical analysis and empirical validation to support this hypothesis.
