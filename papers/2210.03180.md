# [A ResNet is All You Need? Modeling A Strong Baseline for Detecting   Referable Diabetic Retinopathy in Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03180)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is whether a standard deep convolutional neural network architecture, if trained properly, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the task of detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) from color fundus photographs. The key hypothesis is that with careful training and data curation, a simple ResNet model can match or exceed the performance of more complex deep learning models for referable DR detection, without needing architectural innovations.Specifically, the paper investigates whether a ResNet-18 model, pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on a diverse multi-source training set with calibrated data augmentation, can serve as a strong baseline for referable DR detection across a variety of test sets.The idea is that proper training strategies like using diverse data and data augmentation may be just as or more important than architectural modifications for achieving good generalization. So the paper empirically tests whether a standard ResNet, with no modifications other than good training practices, can compete with or outperform state-of-the-art.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a basic ResNet trained properly can be a strong baseline for referable DR detection, despite a lack of architectural innovations. The paper aims to demonstrate this through extensive experiments and comparisons using multiple public datasets.
