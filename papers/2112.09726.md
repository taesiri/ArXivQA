# [Soundify: Matching Sound Effects to Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09726)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a system to assist video editors in automatically matching appropriate sound effects to video content?

The authors motivate this research question by conducting formative interviews with professional video editors, which revealed that manually matching sounds to video can be a challenging and time-consuming process. 

The paper then presents Soundify, a system aimed at addressing this problem by automatically:

- Surfacing relevant sound clips based on video content 
- Synchronizing the sound clips to objects in the video
- Converting sound clips to spatial audio by adjusting panning and volume 
- Allowing the stacking of multiple sound clips 

The effectiveness of Soundify in automatically matching sounds to videos is then evaluated through:

- A human evaluation study comparing Soundify to a baseline system
- An expert user study with video editors comparing Soundify against manual editing

So in summary, the central research question is focused on developing an automated system (Soundify) to assist with the challenging process of matching appropriate sounds to video content. The paper presents the system and evaluates its ability to effectively match sounds to video.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the development of Soundify, a system that assists video editors in matching sound effects to video. The key ideas behind Soundify include:

- Leveraging existing high-quality sound effects libraries rather than synthesizing audio from scratch. This allows the system to make use of studio-recorded sound clips.

- Repurposing CLIP, an image classification model, to act as an "open-vocabulary" sound detector by probing its activation maps. This allows Soundify to identify matching sounds for arbitrary objects/scenes without needing to train on that specific data. 

- Automatically synchronizing sounds to objects appearing in the video over time.

- Dynamically adjusting the panning and volume of sound clips based on the object's position and size in the video to create spatial audio. 

- Allowing the layering/stacking of multiple sound clips (sound effects and ambients) to build a rich soundscape.

The main evaluation includes:

- A human evaluation study with 889 raters showing Soundify can effectively match sounds across diverse categories.

- An expert user study with 12 professional editors demonstrating Soundify reduces workload, speeds up task time, and improves usability compared to manual editing.

So in summary, the core contribution appears to be the Soundify system itself and evidence that it can effectively and efficiently help video editors match sounds to videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Soundify, a system that assists video editors in matching sounds to video by surfacing relevant audio clips, synchronizing them to objects in the video, converting them to spatial audio, and allowing the stacking of multiple tracks, which is shown through user studies to reduce workload, time, and improve usability compared to manual editing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research in matching sounds to video:

- This paper takes a different approach from audio synthesis methods by leveraging existing high-quality sound effect libraries rather than generating raw audio from scratch. Audio synthesis papers like AutoFoley, FoleyGAN, etc require large datasets and training of generative models, which can result in artifacts. 

- For audio-visual correspondence learning, this paper utilizes CLIP rather than training a model from scratch on large labeled datasets. CLIP provides strong image-text capabilities out-of-the-box. The authors creatively extend CLIP to enable spatial audio through activation maps. Other audio-visual correspondence papers rely on training models on massive datasets.

- This paper focuses on an end-to-end system to assist video editors rather than just a technical component. It is tailored to editors through formative interviews to derive design principles. Other works like CrossCast and Soundtoons also aim to build creator-assistive tools but are focused on different domains like travel podcasts and live audio-driven animations respectively.

- The paper conducts robust evaluation including a large scale human evaluation and an expert user study with real editors. The expert study in particular provides useful insights on real-world usefulness. Some other papers demonstrate capabilities only through technical metrics or small studies. 

- Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution in its application of repurposing CLIP for audio-visual tasks to build an end-to-end assistive tool for video editing grounded in real editor needs and thoroughly evaluated. The approach and findings meaningfully advance research at the intersection of multimedia and HCI.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving very fine-grained synchronizations for certain sounds like footsteps by incorporating motion cues, conducting state analysis, and leveraging video metadata.

- Continually updating Soundify with improved versions of CLIP to ensure accurate classification of sound objects. The authors suggest potentially finetuning CLIP on a large set of labels from the audio library. 

- Adding more manual fine-tuning capabilities to Soundify such as custom fades, effects, and EQ adjustments by integrating it into a more comprehensive sound editing software.

- Exploring the utilization of other types of creative mediums beyond audio, such as automatically generating animations or visual effects based on video content.

- Conducting further evaluations on the creative expressiveness enabled by systems like Soundify compared to manual editing. 

- Testing Soundify with more novice users and examining how it may lower the barrier to entry for audio-based video editing.

- Exploring the potential of systems like Soundify to enhance accessibility for creators with disabilities.

In summary, some of the key future directions are improving synchronization, classification, and manual tuning capabilities, expanding the system to other creative domains beyond audio, and conducting additional user studies on creativity, novice users, and accessibility.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents Soundify, a system that assists video editors in matching sound effects to video clips. Through interviews with professional editors, the authors identified four key principles to guide the system design: surface relevant audio clips, synchronize clips to objects in the video, convert clips to spatial audio, and allow stacking of multiple audio tracks. Soundify uses the CLIP image classification model to detect objects in video frames and match them to labels of sound effects clips. It localizes sound emitting objects using activation maps and adjusts the stereo panning and volume of clips accordingly. 

The authors evaluated Soundify in two user studies. A crowdsourced study with 889 participants showed Soundify performed significantly better than a baseline method at matching diverse sounds to video. An expert study with 12 professional editors showed Soundify reduced workload, decreased task time, and improved usability compared to manual editing. The results demonstrate Soundify's capability in assisting video editors by automating the challenging and tedious process of adding sound effects.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents Soundify, a system that assists video editors in matching sounds to video footage. The key method is extending CLIP, an image classification model trained on image-text pairs, to enable open-vocabulary sound detection from videos. Given a video, Soundify runs it through CLIP's image encoder to obtain an encoded vector representing the visual content. It also encodes text labels of sound effects using CLIP's text encoder. It then performs cosine similarity comparisons between the video vector and each sound label vector to surface relevant sounds. To synchronize sounds, it identifies time intervals when objects appear by comparing sound labels to frames. For spatial audio, it passes individual frames through gradient-based localization to obtain activation maps highlighting detected objects. It then sets pan based on object x-coordinate and gain based on object area. Finally, it stacks multiple sound tracks to create an immersive soundscape. This repurposing of CLIP with activation maps allows detecting arbitrary sounds without training on labeled video data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the paper is addressing is how to assist video editors in efficiently and effectively adding sound effects to video content. 

The authors identify through interviews with professional video editors that manually searching for, aligning, and adjusting sound effects for video can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Thus, the paper presents a system called Soundify that aims to help automate parts of this workflow.

Specifically, Soundify addresses the following challenges in matching sounds to video:

- Surfacing relevant sound clips based on video content (Principle 1: Surface)

- Synchronizing sound clips to objects appearing in the video over time (Principle 2: Synchronize) 

- Converting sound clips to spatial audio by adjusting volume and panning based on object position/size (Principle 3: Spatial)

- Allowing layering of multiple sound tracks like sound effects and ambience (Principle 4: Stack)

The key research questions then are:

- Can Soundify effectively match appropriate sounds to video content?

- Does Soundify reduce workload and improve efficiency for video editors when adding sound? 

- How usable is Soundify compared to manual sound editing?

In summary, the main problem is assisting video editors with the challenging task of adding sound effects to videos, which Soundify aims to address through its capabilities of detecting, synchronizing, spatializing, and stacking sounds.
