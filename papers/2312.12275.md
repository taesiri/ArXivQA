# [Emergence of In-Context Reinforcement Learning from Noise Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) holds promise for developing AI agents that can generalize to new tasks through interaction. However, current ICRL methods require training RL agents from scratch or access to optimal policies, which can be difficult.  
- Most real-world settings only provide suboptimal demonstrations rather than full learning histories. So there is a need for a simpler way to enable ICRL from suboptimal demonstrations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ADε, a method to generate synthetic learning histories by systematically introducing noise into a suboptimal demonstration policy. 
- Noise is scheduled from fully random to no noise over each trajectory. This simulates a history of incremental policy improvement.
- ADε trains an agent on these synthetic histories using algorithm distillation to predict actions. At test time no parameter updates are done, achieving fully in-context generalization.

Contributions:
- ADε enables multi-task ICRL without needing true learning histories or optimal policies. Only suboptimal demonstrations are required.
- Experiments in gridworld navigation tasks show ADε can learn policies over 2x better than the demonstrator it learns from.
- Analysis shows ADε can successfully create unified policies from single-task policies and outperform suboptimal demonstrators.
- The method provides a simpler and more feasible way to achieve in-context generalization from demonstrations compared to prior approaches.

In summary, the paper introduces ADε as a novel way to distill policies for in-context reinforcement learning from noisy versions of suboptimal demonstrations rather than actual learning histories. Experiments demonstrate feasibility and performance improvements over demonstrators.
