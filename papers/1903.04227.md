# Pluralistic Image Completion

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an image completion method that can generate multiple diverse and plausible solutions for a given masked input image? The key hypotheses are:1) Modeling the distribution of plausible completions as a conditional latent space allows sampling multiple solutions. However, standard conditional VAE frameworks struggle to capture diversity due to data scarcity. 2) Imposing smooth latent space priors on partial images and coupling the conditional prior to this distribution can help maintain diversity.3) Using parallel reconstructive and generative training paths balances reconstructing ground truth data and creative generation from the prior.4) An enhanced attention mechanism exploiting both short and long range dependencies can improve result quality.In summary, the central goal is developing a probabilistic framework and training procedure that enables a model to produce varied and realistic image completions for the same masked input image. The key novelty is handling the intrinsic one-to-many nature of this problem through coupled conditional latent spaces and tailored training objectives.
