# [Pluralistic Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04227)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop an image completion method that can generate multiple diverse and plausible solutions for a given masked input image? 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Modeling the distribution of plausible completions as a conditional latent space allows sampling multiple solutions. However, standard conditional VAE frameworks struggle to capture diversity due to data scarcity. 

2) Imposing smooth latent space priors on partial images and coupling the conditional prior to this distribution can help maintain diversity.

3) Using parallel reconstructive and generative training paths balances reconstructing ground truth data and creative generation from the prior.

4) An enhanced attention mechanism exploiting both short and long range dependencies can improve result quality.

In summary, the central goal is developing a probabilistic framework and training procedure that enables a model to produce varied and realistic image completions for the same masked input image. The key novelty is handling the intrinsic one-to-many nature of this problem through coupled conditional latent spaces and tailored training objectives.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. A probabilistic framework and dual pipeline network architecture for pluralistic image completion that can generate multiple diverse and plausible solutions for a given masked input image. 

2. Coupling the training of a reconstructive path that utilizes the ground truth data with a separate generative path that maintains higher sample diversity.

3. A novel short+long term attention mechanism that attends to both decoder features and encoder features to improve appearance consistency.

4. Demonstrating higher quality and more diverse image completion results compared to prior work, especially for large holes. The method is able to generate varied results with different shapes, sizes, textures etc for the same input mask.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be in formulating image completion as a conditional image generation problem that produces multiple outputs rather than just a single solution. The dual path framework and coupled training process allows both utilizing the ground truth data while still maintaining diversity. The short+long term attention mechanism also appears to be an important contribution for improving result quality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new dual path framework for pluralistic image completion that can generate multiple diverse and plausible solutions for filling in missing image regions, using parallel reconstructive and generative pipelines along with enhanced attention mechanisms.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares and relates to other research in the field of image completion:

- The key novel contribution is proposing a new framework for "pluralistic image completion", where the goal is to generate multiple diverse and plausible solutions for filling in missing regions of an image, rather than just a single "best guess". This sets it apart from most prior image completion work.

- It draws on and extends research in conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). The paper analyzes limitations of applying CVAEs directly for diverse image completion when there is only one training instance per input image. It proposes a new training framework with coupled conditional and unconditional paths to address this.

- The new framework incorporates adversarial training similar to generative adversarial networks (GANs). It uses separate discriminators for the reconstructive and generative paths. This is related to work on combining VAEs and GANs.

- For the generative path, the training objective does not reconstruct the specific ground truth instance, allowing diversity. This relates to "instance-blind" image generation.

- It proposes a new attention mechanism that extends self-attention to also incorporate encoder-decoder attention. This builds on work using attention for image generation.

- Experiments compare to recent state-of-the-art image completion methods including contextual attention, globally and locally consistent completion, and others. The results demonstrate generating higher quality and more diverse outputs.

Overall, the key novelties are in formulating the pluralistic image completion problem, proposing the coupled training framework to address diversity issues of CVAEs, and showing results surpassing existing methods on this new task. The attention mechanism and comparisons to alternative training approaches are also notable contributions relatimg to broader work in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing models that can generate even more diverse and high-quality completions. The authors note that while their method generates more diverse results than previous approaches, there is still room for improvement in terms of diversity and quality.

- Exploring different conditional prior distributions beyond Gaussians. The authors use Gaussian distributions for their latent priors, but suggest investigating other distributions could lead to further improvements.

- Applying the proposed framework to other conditional generation tasks beyond image completion. The dual training pipeline approach could potentially be useful for other tasks that also suffer from lack of diversity when using standard conditional VAEs. 

- Investigating alternatives to GANs for enforcing training set distributions. The authors note GANs can sometimes lead to artifacts and instability during training. Replacing or augmenting the GAN components with other techniques is another area to explore.

- Developing attention mechanisms that can capture even longer-range dependencies in images. The proposed short+long term attention captures useful contexts, but further enhancements to attention could help generate more globally coherent images.

- Scaling up the framework with more training data and bigger model sizes. Like many deep learning techniques, the authors suggest their approach can benefit from larger datasets and models.

Overall, the main future directions focus on improving diversity and quality of results, expanding applicability of the framework to other tasks, and investigating alternative components like attention and adversarial training. More data and model scaling is also suggested as a general direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a probabilistic framework for pluralistic image completion, which aims to generate multiple diverse and plausible solutions for a given masked image input. The key ideas are:

1) Treat partial images (both the visible and masked regions) as generated from latent spaces with smooth prior distributions. This allows imposing reasonable priors for the masked regions.  

2) Use a dual training pipeline with a reconstructive path to get the distribution of the hidden pixels, and a generative path that only sees the visible pixels. This trades off reconstructing the original image versus maintaining diversity.

3) Introduce a short+long term attention layer that copies features from both decoder and encoder layers, improving appearance consistency. 

Experiments on Paris, CelebA-HQ, ImageNet and Places2 datasets show the model can produce high-quality and diverse outputs. Both qualitative and quantitative results outperform previous methods that generate a single solution per input.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for pluralistic image completion, which aims to generate multiple and diverse plausible solutions for filling in missing regions of an image. The key challenge is that most learning-based methods tend to produce only a single "best guess" result per input, as they are trained to reconstruct the one ground truth image. To overcome this, the authors introduce a probabilistically principled framework with two parallel training paths. One path focuses on reconstructing the original image using the available ground truth for the missing regions. The other path trains a generative model to produce varied results based only on the visible pixels, without seeing the ground truth complement regions. This avoids narrowing the output distribution. The framework imposes adaptive priors on the distributions of missing image regions to maintain reasonable solutions. It uses adversarial training for both paths to match the overall image distribution rather than individual instances. A new short+long term attention mechanism is also introduced to improve coherence. Experiments on face, scene, and object datasets demonstrate the model's ability to generate multiple high-quality and diverse solutions for the same inputs.

In summary, this paper presents a novel dual training path approach with adaptive priors to enable a conditional generative model to produce multiple varied outputs for image completion. A new attention mechanism helps improve result quality. The model is shown to generate diverse yet plausible solutions on several datasets, overcoming limitations of prior single-output learning methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel framework for pluralistic image completion, which can generate multiple diverse and plausible solutions for a given masked image input. The key method is a dual pipeline training architecture with a reconstructive path and a generative path:

The reconstructive path utilizes the full image data during training, including the visible pixels and the ground truth hidden pixels. It imposes a latent prior on the missing regions and aims to reconstruct the original image. This path trains an inference network and generator. 

The generative path only sees the visible pixels during training. It learns a conditional latent distribution for the missing regions from which it can sample at test time. The goal is not to reconstruct any specific ground truth instance but to generate samples that match the overall data distribution. This path shares weights with the reconstructive path but is trained with an adversarial loss. 

At test time, only the generative path is used. By sampling from the learned conditional latent distribution, it can output multiple plausible and diverse solutions for a given masked image. The two training paths balance between reconstructing the ground truth versus maintaining diversity. The model also uses a novel attention mechanism to ensure consistency. Experiments show it generates higher quality and more diverse results than existing methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:

- The paper is addressing the task of image completion, where missing or masked regions in an image need to be filled in. 

- Traditional image completion methods tend to generate a single "best guess" result for each input image. However, the authors argue that image completion is an intrinsically creative process with many reasonable possibilities.

- So the main problem they aim to tackle is how to perform "pluralistic image completion", where the method can generate multiple diverse but plausible solutions for filling in the missing regions of a given masked input image.

- A key question is how to formulate and train a model to output diverse results while still maintaining visual realism and coherence. The authors identify difficulties faced by existing conditional VAE methods when trained on image completion data where there is only one ground truth instance per masked input image.

- To address this, the main questions they seek to answer are:

1) How can they impose proper priors and regularization to maintain diversity of outputs? 

2) What network architecture and training procedure will balance reconstructing the original data while still allowing creative generation?

3) How can they ensure visual coherence and consistency between the generated missing regions and the given visible parts?

So in summary, the paper focuses on the problem of pluralistic image completion through proposing solutions to enable a model to generate multiple varied but realistic completions for a given partial input image.
