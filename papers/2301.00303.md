# [Rethinking with Retrieval: Faithful Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00303)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it aims to address is: 

How can external knowledge be effectively utilized to assist large language models (LLMs) without requiring additional training or fine-tuning?

The key points are:

- LLMs like GPT-3 have shown great performance on NLP tasks through in-context learning, but their knowledge may be incomplete or incorrect. 

- Previous methods for incorporating external knowledge often require extra training/fine-tuning which is impractical for large LLMs.

- This paper proposes a lightweight post-processing approach called "Rethinking with Retrieval" (RR) to leverage external knowledge to enhance LLMs without retraining them.

- RR uses chain-of-thought prompting to get reasoning paths from the LLM, retrieves relevant knowledge using each reasoning step, and selects the most faithful prediction based on the retrieved knowledge.

- The effectiveness of RR is evaluated on commonsense, temporal, and tabular reasoning tasks using GPT-3 and different knowledge sources like Wikipedia.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed RR approach can effectively utilize external knowledge to make LLMs like GPT-3 more accurate and faithful on complex reasoning tasks without needing additional training or fine-tuning. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called "Rethinking with Retrieval" (RR) to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 by utilizing external knowledge. LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or incomplete explanations even if they predict the right answer. This is because the knowledge encoded in LLMs during pre-training may be incomplete or inaccurate. To address this, RR first uses chain-of-thought prompting to generate multiple reasoning paths that include explanations and predictions. It then retrieves relevant knowledge from sources like Wikipedia based on each step in the reasoning paths. Using the retrieved knowledge, RR selects the most faithful prediction out of all the sampled paths. 

The authors evaluate RR on commonsense, temporal, and tabular reasoning tasks using GPT-3 and different knowledge sources. The results show that RR consistently improves over baselines like few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency, without any additional training or fine-tuning of the LLM. This demonstrates that RR can effectively leverage external knowledge to produce more faithful explanations and improve predictions from LLMs. The analysis also examines the limitations of LLMs, the importance of decomposition-based retrieval, and the impact of LM size. Overall, the paper presents a lightweight yet effective approach to incorporate external knowledge into LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:

The paper presents a novel post-processing approach called "rethinking with retrieval" (RR) for utilizing external knowledge to assist large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. The key steps are: 1) Use chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate multiple diverse reasoning paths for a given query, with each path containing an explanation followed by a prediction. 2) Decompose each reasoning path into individual steps. 3) Use each reasoning step to retrieve relevant knowledge from external sources like Wikipedia or Wikidata. 4) Estimate the faithfulness of each full reasoning path based on the retrieved knowledge supporting its steps. 5) Select the final prediction that has the highest faithfulness score according to the retrieved knowledge across all sampled reasoning paths. This approach allows RR to leverage external knowledge without requiring additional training or fine-tuning of the LLM. Experiments on commonsense, temporal, and tabular reasoning tasks demonstrate that RR produces more faithful explanations and improves the performance of GPT-3.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of how to effectively utilize external knowledge to assist large language models (LLMs) in making more faithful explanations and accurate predictions, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. 

Specifically, the paper points out that LLMs may have incomplete, outdated, or incorrect knowledge stored within them. Thus external sources of knowledge like Wikipedia can be useful to compensate for the deficiencies of LLMs. However, previous methods for incorporating external knowledge into smaller language models often require extra training or fine-tuning, which is impractical for large models. 

To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a new approach called "rethinking with retrieval" (RR) that retrieves relevant external knowledge based on the reasoning steps obtained through chain-of-thought prompting. This allows RR to provide more faithful explanations and improved predictions compared to just using the LLM alone.

The key research question is: How can we effectively leverage external knowledge sources to assist LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without extra training or fine-tuning? The paper aims to address this by presenting the RR framework and evaluating it on commonsense, temporal, and tabular reasoning tasks.
