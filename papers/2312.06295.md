# [Cataract-1K: Cataract Surgery Dataset for Scene Segmentation, Phase   Recognition, and Irregularity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06295)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Cataract-1K, the largest publicly available cataract surgery video dataset to date, comprising 1000 videos recorded during surgeries at Klinikum Klagenfurt hospital. The dataset features annotations for surgical phase recognition across 56 videos, pixel-level semantic segmentation of anatomical structures and instruments in 30 videos, and subsets depicting two major intra-operative irregularities - pupil contraction and intraocular lens (IOL) rotation. The phase recognition subset enables research on surgical workflow modeling while the segmentation subset supports studies on scene understanding and instrument tracking. The irregularity subsets can empower algorithms for detecting anomalies during surgery. Comprehensive experiments validate annotation quality and benchmark performance of state-of-the-art models on phase recognition and multi-class segmentation tasks. Cross-domain evaluation reveals the domain shift between cataract surgery datasets, motivating future research on domain adaptation. By providing multi-task supervision at scale, Cataract-1K aims to spur advances in context-aware assistance systems for cataract surgery. The datasets and codes are publicly released to lower barriers for future research.
