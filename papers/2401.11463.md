# [Estimating the Usefulness of Clarifying Questions and Answers for   Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Research on generating clarifying questions in conversational search systems is abundant, but processing and comprehending users' answers is scarce. 
- Simply appending answers to clarifying questions to the original query can potentially degrade retrieval performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a classifier to assess usefulness of prompted clarifying questions and answers given by the user. 
- Only append useful questions/answers to the conversation history for query rewriting.
- Usefulness classifier is a fine-tuned T5 model based on manually annotated subset of ClariQ data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel method to process answers to clarifying questions based on classifying usefulness. Mitigates performance drops when non-useful questions/answers are used.
- Demonstrate significant improvements over non-mixed-initiative baselines on CAsT'22 dataset (12% relative gain in Recall@1000).
- Analysis shows performance drops when always using questions/answers (-13% nDCG@3) vs only using useful ones.  
- First steps towards improved answer processing methods in conversational search.

In summary, the paper presents a usefulness classifier to selectively incorporate clarifying questions and answers to improve passage retrieval, while avoiding potential drops when non-useful information is included. The method is shown to outperform baselines on the CAsT dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to assess the usefulness of clarifying questions and answers in conversational search systems, in order to selectively incorporate only useful information into query reformulations and improve retrieval performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a simple yet effective method for processing answers to clarifying questions. The method is based on classifying usefulness of the prompted question and the given answer.

2. Identifying scenarios where asking clarifying questions resulted in improved passage retrieval, and where it decreased the retrieval performance.

Specifically, the paper presents a classifier-based mixed-initiative method (MI-Clf) that extends the original query only when the clarifying question or answer is deemed useful. Experiments on the TREC CAsT 2022 dataset show improvements over non-mixed-initiative baselines when using this method. The paper also analyzes cases where always appending the clarifying question and answer decreases performance when neither is useful. So the main contributions are around the proposed usefulness classification method and analysis of its impact.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Conversational search
- Mixed initiative
- Clarifying questions
- Answer processing
- Usefulness classification
- Query rewriting
- Passage retrieval

The paper focuses on conversational search systems, specifically under the mixed-initiative paradigm where the system can ask clarifying questions. It proposes methods for processing the answers given to such clarifying questions, including assessing the usefulness of the questions and answers. Key ideas include appending useful questions/answers to the query to improve passage retrieval performance. The methods are evaluated on the TREC CAsT 2022 dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a usefulness classifier to determine if the clarifying question and answer are useful to append to the original query. What features does this classifier use to make this determination? How was the classifier trained and evaluated?

2. The paper finds that in 68% of cases, the clarifying question and/or answer provide new useful information. What are some reasons why the clarifying question and answer may not provide useful information in the remaining 32% of cases? 

3. The paper compares appending all clarifying questions and answers (MI-All) versus only useful ones (MI-Clf). In what situations does MI-All hurt performance versus MI-Clf? What is the reason for this performance difference?

4. The paper finds higher performance gains when the answer is deemed useful compared to when the clarifying question is useful. Why might this be the case? What properties of a useful answer enable these higher performance gains?

5. How does the paper evaluate usefulness of the clarifying questions and answers? Is this evaluation approach reliable or could it be improved? What other signals could help determine usefulness?

6. How does the paper select which clarifying question to ask from the pool? Could this clarifying question selection be enhanced to prefer more useful questions? 

7. The paper uses a two-stage retrieve and re-rank pipeline. How do the relative gains from mixed-initiative interactions compare between these two stages? What might this suggest about the impact of mixed-initiative?

8. What other query expansion or reformulation approaches could be used instead of or in conjunction with appending the clarifying questions and answers? How might these compare?

9. The paper focuses on passage retrieval, but could this approach extend to document retrieval as well? What modifications would need to be made for longer documents?

10. How sensitive is the performance of this approach to the quality of the clarifying questions available to select from? If lower quality questions are asked, does the usefulness classifier mitigate impacts on performance?
