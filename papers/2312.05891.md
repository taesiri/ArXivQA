# [A conservative hybrid physics-informed neural network method for   Maxwell-Ampère-Nernst-Planck equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on solving the Maxwell-Ampère-Nernst-Planck (MANP) equations, which model the dynamics of charged particles. The original numerical scheme for solving these equations has some limitations:
1) The curl-free relaxation algorithm used to correct errors is not applicable in 1D. 
2) It is difficult to incorporate boundary conditions involving the electric displacement field.
3) The approximation formula for the dummy variable Θ works well in 2D but fails in 1D. This formula was found through extensive numerical tests and may not generalize. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a hybrid method combining conventional finite difference discretizations with a physics-informed neural network (PINN):

1) A NN is used to approximate Θ. The loss function is designed to constrain the electric displacement field to be curl-free. This allows the method to handle 1D problems.  

2) Boundary conditions like Neumann BC can be easily enforced on the NN through a penalty term in the loss.

3) The method retains properties like mass conservation and positivity preservation analytically, even if the NN approximation has errors.

4) An accelerated curl-free relaxation algorithm is proposed.

Contributions:

1) The hybrid method successfully handles 1D problems where the original method fails.

2) It can incorporate complex boundary conditions flexibly through the NN loss.

3) The approximation for Θ is learned automatically rather than through numerical tests.

4) Conservation properties are retained robustly even with NN approximation errors.

5) The method is faster than the original scheme due to an accelerated curl-free algorithm.

6) Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed hybrid scheme.

In summary, the key idea is to use a PINN to overcome limitations of the conventional scheme while retaining its useful properties like conservation laws. The hybrid method achieves better accuracy, flexibility and efficiency.
