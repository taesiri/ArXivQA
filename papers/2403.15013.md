# [Extracting Human Attention through Crowdsourced Patch Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image classification models trained on biased datasets suffer from reduced accuracy and lack of generalizability when deployed in the real world. 
- Biases arise from co-occurrence of certain objects or features in the training data. For example, boat images mostly contain water backgrounds.
- Existing methods to mitigate bias have limitations - they require multiple datasets, prior knowledge of biases, image reconstruction leading to quality loss, etc.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel two-step method to extract human attention from images using AI assistance and crowdsourcing:
   1) Saliency Segmentation: A pre-trained salient object detection model identifies potential object locations. Humans verify if target object is present.
   2) Attention Crowdsourcing: Image is divided into overlapping patches. Crowd workers label each patch for presence of target object. Responses aggregated into attention mask.

- The extracted human attention mask is then used to train image classifier focused on target object, making it robust to biases.

Main Contributions:
- Novel patch-labeling based method to efficiently extract human attention for a given image using AI and crowdsourcing.
- Empirically demonstrated the human attention mask's effectiveness in guiding classifier models to mitigate bias and improve accuracy. 
- Comparative crowdsourced experiments showed the approach is 3.4x faster than polygon annotation of objects.
- Discussed crowdsourcing advantages of the method regarding parallelism, user adaptivity, and filtering of erroneous submissions.

In summary, the paper introduces an explainable human-AI collaborative technique to extract attention from images for bias mitigation in classification models. Key empirical results and crowdsourcing merits highlight the efficiency and reliability of this method.
