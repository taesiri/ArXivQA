# [SATDAUG -- A Balanced and Augmented Dataset for Detecting Self-Admitted   Technical Debt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07690)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) is an important concept where developers explicitly document shortcuts or temporary workarounds in code comments. Successfully identifying SATD allows complementary analysis to static code analysis.
- Existing SATD datasets suffer from class imbalance, particularly for categorizing specific types of SATD. This limits the performance of machine learning models in accurately identifying and categorizing SATD.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present SATDAUG, an augmented and balanced dataset derived from multiple software artifacts - source code comments, issue tracker, pull requests, commit messages. 
- Augmentation is done using AugGPT to generate paraphrased versions of minority class SATD instances, while preserving semantics. This balances the dataset.
- The augmented dataset has much richer labeled data for training ML/DL models for SATD identification and categorization.

Main Contributions:
- Publicly released balanced and augmented SATD dataset spanning multiple artifacts.
- Methodology to augment minority SATD types using AugGPT and multi-turn dialog prompts.  
- Analysis showing improved balance using entropy metric and similarity to original data.
- Demonstrates improved ML model performance on imbalanced data problem.
- Discusses ideas for further improvement of dataset and future research opportunities enabled.

In summary, the paper presents an augmented SATD dataset to address the class imbalance problem in existing datasets. It enables improved training of models for identifying and categorizing technical debt.
