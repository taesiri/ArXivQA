# [RBF-PINN: Non-Fourier Positional Embedding in Physics-Informed Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, there has been limited exploration of feature mapping techniques to improve their performance. Feature mapping projects inputs to a higher dimensional space to mitigate issues like spectral bias. 

- The paper highlights limitations of commonly used Fourier feature mappings for certain PDEs. For example, the Fourier encoding leads to artifacts and poor performance in solving the diffusion and Burgers' equations. Random Fourier features also struggle with high dimensional PDEs like Navier-Stokes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a framework for designing effective feature mappings based on conditionally positive definite Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). 

- They propose an RBF feature mapping with optional polynomial terms (RBF-P) that outperforms alternatives like Fourier and sinusoidal mappings across various PDE test cases.

- RBF-P satisfies properties like normalization and symmetry to ensure first-order accuracy based on a composed kernel analysis. Gaussian RBFs are found to be most effective among different RBF types tested.

Main Contributions:
- Thorough benchmarking of various feature mapping techniques for PINNs, including novel applications of methods like complex triangle encoding.

- Introduction of RBF feature mapping that consistently improves accuracy over Fourier methods for diverse PDEs such as Burgers', Navier-Stokes, and high dimensional Poisson equations. 

- Ablation studies characterizing impact of number of RBFs, polynomial terms, and RBF types. Additive polynomial terms are shown to be especially useful for nonlinear PDEs.

- The proposed technique is compatible with other methods for enhancing PINNs and contributions towards addressing their spectral bias limitations.

In summary, the paper presents an effective RBF feature mapping to enhance representation learning for PINNs across a variety of physics-based modeling use cases.
