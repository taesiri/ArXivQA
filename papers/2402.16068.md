# [ROS-Causal: A ROS-based Causal Analysis Framework for Human-Robot   Interaction Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16068)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deploying robots in human-shared spaces requires understanding the interactions between agents and objects. Modeling cause-and-effect relationships through causal inference can help predict human behaviors and guide robot interventions. However, existing causal discovery methods have two limitations: 1) they require separate offline data collection and analysis steps, and 2) they lack integration with ROS, the standard software framework in robotics. These limitations hinder effective utilization of causal discovery in robotics applications.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ROS-Causal, a ROS-based framework for onboard data collection and causal discovery in human-robot interaction scenarios. ROS-Causal has a modular pipeline consisting of:

1) Data Merging nodes that collect robot and human data from various ROS topics into custom messages  

2) Data Collection and Post-Processing node that accumulates data batches over time, allows post-processing to derive high-level features, and stores data batches for analysis

3) Causal Discovery node that runs causal analysis algorithms like PCMCI and F-PCMCI on the collected data batches, decomposes the resulting causal model for access via a ROS topic

The nodes operate asynchronously, enabling concurrent data collection and analysis.  

The paper also introduces an HRI simulator called ROS-Causal_HRISim to design interaction scenarios and provide data for analysis.

Main Contributions:

- First ROS-based framework for onboard causal data collection and discovery for robotics
- New HRI simulator for causal analysis applications  
- Demonstrates feasibility of simultaneous data collection and analysis in a simulated HRI scenario
- Integration of causal discovery methods with ROS facilitates utilization of reconstructed causal models for real-time robot reasoning and planning

The modular pipeline and public availability of the framework and simulator enable further extensions and applications.
