# [Learning an Unreferenced Metric for Online Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop an automatic dialogue evaluation metric that does not require true reference responses during inference, and correlates well with human judgements? The key hypotheses appear to be:1. Dialogue exhibits an inherent temporal structure, where utterances transition between latent semantic states. Capturing this structure is important for dialogue evaluation.2. Leveraging pre-trained language models like BERT to extract utterance representations, combined with modeling the temporal transitions, will allow developing an unreferenced automated dialogue evaluation metric that correlates better with human judgements.The authors propose a model called MaUDE that encodes utterances with BERT, models transitions with an RNN, and trains the metric using noise contrastive estimation to distinguish good vs bad responses - all without requiring true reference responses. Experiments show MaUDE correlates better with human judgements compared to baseline metrics.In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling dialogue structure and using pre-trained language models can help develop an unreferenced automated metric for dialogue evaluation that correlates with humans. The key contribution is demonstrating the feasibility of this approach through the proposed MaUDE model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an unreferenced automated dialogue evaluation metric called MaUdE (Metric for automatic Unreferenced dialogue Evaluation). The key ideas are:- Showing that dialogue has an inherent temporal structure, where utterances transition between latent representations. This is demonstrated through visualizations of BERT embeddings on several dialogue datasets. - Leveraging this temporal structure by using a BERT encoder along with a recurrent neural network to model the transitions between utterance representations. - Training the metric in a completely unsupervised way via noise contrastive estimation, to differentiate between good responses and various adversarial negative responses.- Evaluating the metric on PersonaChat and showing it achieves better correlation with human judgments compared to prior unreferenced metrics like RUBER and InferSent. The main benefit is that MaUdE can be used to evaluate dialog systems in an online setting without requiring access to reference responses, since it is fully unreferenced. This also allows it to be used for training and optimization of dialog models through reinforcement learning. Overall, it demonstrates the promise of leveraging large pretrained language models and discourse structure for unreferenced dialogue evaluation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of unreferenced dialogue evaluation metrics:- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new unreferenced automatic dialogue evaluation metric called \dtm{} (\dtma{}) that uses pre-trained language models and models the temporal transitions between utterances. This differentiates it from prior work like RUBER and InferSent that use simpler encoders like LSTMs.- Most prior work in this field has focused on referenced metrics that require comparison to a ground truth response. This paper explores the unreferenced setting which is more applicable for online model-human or model-model evaluation where ground truth responses are not available.- The proposed \dtm{} model achieves better correlation with human judgments compared to baseline models, demonstrating the value of using pre-trained language models and modeling dialogue structure for this task.- The noise contrastive estimation training approach used in this paper is similar to RUBER, but RUBER does not model the temporal structure of dialogues. The combination of pre-trained encoders and explicitly modeling transitions between utterances is novel.- The paper shows \dtm{} generalizes well to unseen datasets compared to baselines. Most prior work has focused on tuning metrics to a specific dataset so this evaluation of generalization is an important contribution.- The qualitative analysis provides examples of where \dtm{} succeeds and fails compared to other methods, shedding light on the types of responses it is able to effectively evaluate.Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in unreferenced dialogue evaluation by demonstrating the value of pre-trained language models and explicitly modeling dialogue structure for this challenging task. The results are very promising and open up further work to build even more effective unreferenced metrics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing better unreferenced metrics by exploring different model architectures and training approaches. The authors state that their work shows the promise of leveraging pre-trained language models and modeling dialogue structure, but there is room for improvement.- Combining unreferenced metrics with referenced metrics. The authors suggest their unreferenced metric could be combined with lexical overlap metrics like BLEU/ROUGE to get the benefits of both approaches.- Using the metric to optimize dialogue systems during training. The authors propose using their metric to provide rewards and train better dialogue generation models.- Evaluating on a wider range of datasets. The authors evaluated on PersonaChat but suggest assessing generalization ability on more dialogue datasets, especially in other languages. - Analysis of what linguistic properties the metric captures. The authors suggest further analysis on what attributes of dialogue quality the metric is able to assess well versus poorly.- Applications to other dialogue tasks like dialogue state tracking. The authors propose the metric could be adapted for evaluating other dialogue system components besides response generation.In summary, the main future works are improving the unreferenced metrics themselves, combining them with referenced metrics, using them during dialogue system training, and evaluating/analyzing them on more datasets and tasks. The authors see promise in learning unreferenced metrics but there is still much room for development in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes an unreferenced automated dialogue evaluation metric called MaUdE (Metric for Automatic Unreferenced Dialogue Evaluation). MaUdE uses pretrained language models like BERT to extract utterance representations, and models the temporal transitions between utterances using a recurrent neural network. It is trained via noise contrastive estimation to distinguish between valid responses and carefully constructed negative responses. Experiments on the PersonaChat dataset show that MaUdE achieves higher correlation with human judgments compared to baselines, without needing access to reference responses at test time. Analyses demonstrate the metric's robustness on different response types, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen datasets. Overall, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of learning unreferenced automatic dialogue evaluation metrics using pretrained models and modeling dialogue structure.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:The paper explores using large pre-trained language models and the temporal structure of dialogue to learn an automated dialogue evaluation metric. The authors propose an unreferenced metric called MaUdE (Metric for Automatic Unreferenced Dialogue Evaluation) that leverages sentence representations from pre-trained language models like BERT. It is trained via noise contrastive estimation to differentiate between valid dialogue responses and carefully constructed negative examples. MaUdE also uses a recurrent neural network to model the transitions between utterances in a dialogue, allowing it to better correlate with human judgements. Experiments show that MaUdE is robust across different types of responses including semantic positives, semantic negatives, and syntactic negatives. It also achieves higher correlation with human annotations compared to baselines, without requiring true responses for comparison during inference. This indicates it can be used for online evaluation of dialogues. Since it provides immediate, continuous rewards at the single-step level, MaUdE can also potentially be used for optimizing and training better dialogue generation models. Overall, leveraging pre-trained language models and modeling utterance transitions helps the metric correlate better with human judgements of dialog quality.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new model called MaUdE for unreferenced dialogue evaluation. The key idea is to train text encoders using noise contrastive estimation (NCE) to distinguish between valid dialogue responses and carefully constructed negative examples. It uses BERT to encode utterances, and also learns a recurrent neural network on top of the BERT embeddings to model the temporal transitions in dialogues. The model is trained using NCE on positive responses from the dataset along with negative responses constructed by corrupting responses syntactically (e.g. word shuffling) and semantically (e.g. sampling responses from other dialogues). The loss trains MaUdE end-to-end to output a score between 0 and 1 indicating the quality of a response given the dialogue context. Experiments show the proposed model correlates better with human judgments compared to previous methods.
