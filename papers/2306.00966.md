# [The Hidden Language of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00966)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the central research question is: How can we understand and interpret the inner representations of textual concepts in text-to-image diffusion models? Specifically, the authors aim to "demystify" the process of how these models map text inputs to visual representations by decomposing a textual concept into a small set of interpretable tokens from the model's vocabulary. The key hypothesis appears to be that analyzing these decompositions can reveal interesting and non-trivial structures in how concepts are represented in state-of-the-art text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion.In summary, the main research question is focused on developing methods to interpret concept representations in text-to-image models, in order to better understand the inner workings of these black box generative models. The key hypothesis is that analyzing concept decompositions can provide insights into how these models perceive concepts and transform text to images.
