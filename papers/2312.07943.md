# [ReFusion: Learning Image Fusion from Reconstruction with Learnable Loss   via Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07943)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes ReFusion, a novel meta-learning based image fusion framework that learns to fuse images by learning from the task of reconstructing the source images. The key innovation is a learnable parameterized fusion loss proposed by a loss function proposal module. This adaptive loss guides the lightweight fusion module to retain maximal information from the source images. The entire frameworkalternates between an inner update that tries to fuse images using the current loss, an outer update that optimizes the loss proposal module based on the reconstruction loss, and a fusion update step. By tying the learning of the fusion module with the reconstruction task through the meta-learning strategy, ReFusion removes the need for manual design of loss functions. Experiments across infrared-visible, multi-focus, multi-exposure, and medical image fusion show state-of-the-art quantitative results and visual quality. The framework demonstrates flexibility in handling diverse fusion tasks. The alternating meta-learning based training scheme enables continuous refinement of the fusion process by dynamically tailoring the loss function.
