# [Iterative Online Image Synthesis via Diffusion Model for Imbalanced   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Medical image classification often suffers from class imbalance due to limited data and varying disease prevalence. This leads to poor model generalization and biased predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an Iterative Online Image Synthesis (IOIS) framework to address class imbalance in medical image classification. It contains two key modules:
   1) Online Image Synthesis (OIS): Generates representative samples tailored for online training of the classifier using the classifier's gradients to guide image synthesis in each epoch.  
   2) Accuracy Adaptive Sampling (AAS): Dynamically balances the number of synthesized images per class based on the training accuracy. More images are generated for classes with lower accuracy.

Main Contributions:  
- Introduces the novel IOIS framework that alleviates class imbalance at both the instance level (via OIS) and the class level (via AAS).
- OIS synthesizes images tailored to the classifier's ongoing development, making them more representative. 
- AAS balances the number of synthetic images per class based on the classifier's per-class accuracy.
- Experiments on skin lesion and diabetic retinopathy datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness of the proposed modules.  
- The framework is scalable as it leverages an unlabeled diffusion model without re-training.

In summary, the paper presents an iterative framework for online image synthesis to address the class imbalance problem in medical image classification. By adaptively generating tailored synthetic images guided by the classifier's training status, it enhances model generalization and balanced predictions across disease categories.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an iterative online image synthesis framework with online image synthesis and accuracy adaptive sampling modules to address class imbalance for medical image classification by dynamically generating tailored samples for underperforming classes during classifier training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1) It proposes an Online Image Synthesis (OIS) module that generates augmented data tailored to the classifier during training by utilizing the classifier's gradients to guide the diffusion model. This allows the synthesized images to become more representative of their classes over time.

2) It introduces an Accuracy Adaptive Sampling (AAS) module that dynamically determines the class distribution of synthesized images based on the training accuracy of each class. AAS generates more samples for classes with lower accuracy to address class imbalance. 

3) It conducts experiments on two medical image datasets (HAM10000 and APTOS) that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods in tackling imbalanced classification. The results also validate the effectiveness of each proposed component (OIS and AAS).

In summary, the key contribution is an iterative framework with online image synthesis and accuracy adaptive sampling to improve imbalanced classification performance in medical imaging.
