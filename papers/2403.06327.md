# [Hybrid Soft Electrostatic Metamaterial Gripper for Multi-surface,   Multi-object Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing soft grippers have limitations in payload capacity, residual forces during release, and ability to handle diverse objects. 
- Electroadhesive grippers are gentle but have low load capacity and residual forces slowing release.
- Metamaterial grippers require external preloading but offer high adhesion strength. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a Soft Electrostatic Metamaterial (SEM) gripper combining electroadhesion and metamaterial adhesion. 
- Electroadhesion generates electrostatic forces for self-preloading of metamaterial cuts.
- Metamaterial cuts allow tuning of adhesion strength and peeling direction.

Contributions:
- Performed computational optimization of metamaterial cut patterns to maximize grasping capacity along one axis while minimizing residual forces for quick release in orthogonal axis.
- Developed layer-by-layer fabrication process to integrate electroadhesive electrodes with optimized metamaterial cut patterns.
- Demonstrated up to 1617x weight lifting capacity and ability to handle diverse surfaces.  
- Showcased modular two-finger gripper successfully grasping 5 different objects of varying size, shape and weight.
- Addressed limitations of external preloading and residual forces compared to previous metamaterial and electroadhesive grippers.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of electroadhesion and optimized metamaterial cuts to create a versatile soft gripper with high adhesion strength, directional tuning, and rapid pick-and-release. The modular design also enables handling of diverse shapes, surfaces and payloads in a single system.
