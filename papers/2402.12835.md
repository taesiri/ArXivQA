# [PANDA: Preference Adaptation for Enhancing Domain-Specific Abilities of   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12835)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 perform well on many natural language tasks but often fall short compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models that are fine-tuned on datasets for particular tasks. 
- Methods like knowledge distillation can help transfer capabilities from domain experts to LLMs but require fine-tuning LLMs which is resource intensive and often reduces their capabilities. 
- Alternative self-reflection methods rely on the LLM's limited ability to understand expert knowledge.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose PANDA, a tuning-free method to enhance domain-specific capabilities of LLMs by adapting their preferences to align with an expert model without fine-tuning the LLM.

Key Ideas:
- In the learning stage, the expert model generates samples on the training data which are used to create preference pairs. The LLM is prompted to generate explanations about why the expert prefers one response over another.  
- These "insight" explanations make up an insight pool that allows the LLM to develop deeper understanding of the expert's knowledge beyond just behavior.
- At inference time, relevant insights are retrieved from this pool and provided in the context for the LLM to guide its preferences like the expert.

Main Contributions:
- Propose PANDA as a tuning-free approach to augment domain-specific capabilities of LLMs by adapting their preferences using insights from expert models.
- Show PANDA significantly improves LLM performance on text classification and interactive decision tasks.
- Demonstrate PANDA can help LLM surpass the expert model on some tasks, revealing potential for tuning-free methods to achieve weak-to-strong generalization.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel tuning-free method PANDA that can effectively enhance the domain-specific capabilities of LLMs by allowing them to learn from and adapt to the preferences of expert models without requiring additional fine-tuning.
