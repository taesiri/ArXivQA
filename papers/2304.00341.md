# [JacobiNeRF: NeRF Shaping with Mutual Information Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00341)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we train neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to not only reconstruct a 3D scene's appearance and geometry, but also encode semantic correlations and mutual dependencies between different regions/entities in the scene?

The key hypothesis is that by shaping the learning dynamics of a NeRF using contrastive regularization based on mutual information gradients, the model can learn to produce semantically meaningful and locally coherent responses when perturbed along the gradient of a single scene entity. This will allow propagating information like semantic labels more efficiently.

In summary, the paper proposes a "JacobiNeRF" method to shape NeRF scene representations to better reflect underlying semantic structures. This is done by aligning the Jacobians (gradients) of correlated scene entities to maximize their mutual information, enabling semantic resonances for tasks like sparse label propagation.
