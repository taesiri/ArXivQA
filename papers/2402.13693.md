# [CMNER: A Chinese Multimodal NER Dataset based on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13693)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) is an important NLP task that utilizes both text and images to detect named entities. 
- There is a lack of Chinese MNER datasets, which limits research progress on MNER in Chinese. Existing English MNER datasets do not properly emulate real-world social media posts that contain one text and multiple relevant images.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct a new Chinese Multimodal NER (CMNER) dataset sourced from Chinese social media site Weibo.
- The dataset contains 5,000 Weibo posts paired with a total of 18,326 images. Each post has 1 text and on average 3.67 relevant images.
- Four entity types are annotated: person (PER), location (LOC), organization (ORG), and miscellaneous (MISC). Detailed annotation guidelines are provided.
- Benchmark experiments using two MNER models are provided on CMNER. Results show images consistently improve model performance, validating the dataset's efficacy.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of CMNER - the first high-quality, manually annotated Chinese MNER dataset properly emulating real social media data characteristics.
- Experimental results demonstrating images improve NER performance on this dataset, and baseline metrics for further research.  
- Cross-lingual experiments between CMNER and English Twitter2015 dataset that show Chinese and English can mutually enhance NER model performance, suggesting future multilingual MNER opportunities.

In summary, the key novelty is the new Chinese multimodal NER dataset enabling future research. Benchmark experiments validate its utility and quality. Cross-lingual experiments also showcase exciting opportunities for using this dataset to improve multilingual named entity recognition.
