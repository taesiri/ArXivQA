## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called uncommonsense abductive reasoning, which involves generating explanations for unlikely or unexpected outcomes given a context. The authors create a new English dataset called UNcommonsense containing 20k context-outcome pairs sourced from existing commonsense reasoning datasets, along with 41k human-generated and machine-generated explanations. They analyze differences between human and machine-generated explanations, finding that machine-enhanced human explanations combine the specificity of machine explanations and the diversity of human explanations. The authors also propose online imitation learning methods to improve accessible language models on this task. Experiments show that their proposed methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, especially on uncommonsense examples, demonstrating the benefits of exposure to model-generated mistakes during training. Overall, this work introduces a new challenging reasoning task focused on uncommon situations, along with a dataset, analysis of human vs. machine performance, and online learning methods to improve reasoning about unlikely scenarios.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces a new task called uncommonsense abductive reasoning, which involves generating explanations for unlikely outcomes that make them more plausible given the context. The authors curate a new English dataset called UNcommonsense containing over 20k context-outcome pairs sourced from existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks. The outcomes are identified as uncommon using incorrect answers or LLM-generated improbable outcomes. The authors collect over 40k explanations from crowdworkers and LLMs to explain the uncommon outcomes. They analyze differences between human and LLM explanations, finding crowd explanations are more creative but lack details while LLM explanations are more specific but less diverse. The authors propose using LLMs to refine crowd explanations, combining benefits of both. They also explore online imitation learning methods to train accessible LMs for uncommonsense reasoning, finding algorithms like DAgger that leverage expert demonstrations during training improve over standard supervised fine-tuning. The paper demonstrates the challenge of reasoning about uncommon situations compared to everyday commonsense reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called UNcommonsense for abductive reasoning about unusual situations, finds that combining crowd-written and LLM-generated explanations produces the highest quality, and shows that online imitation learning methods improve performance on uncommonsense abductive reasoning over supervised fine-tuning.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we develop natural language models that can accurately perform abductive reasoning for uncommon, unusual, and unlikely situations?

In particular, the paper introduces a new task and dataset focused on "uncommonsense" abductive reasoning, in contrast to most prior work that focuses on reasoning about common, everyday situations. The key contributions towards this question include:

1. Introducing the new UNcommonsense dataset for abductive reasoning about uncommon situations.

2. Analyzing differences between human and model performance on uncommonsense abductive reasoning, finding that model-enhanced human explanations achieve the best tradeoff between specificity and diversity.

3. Proposing and evaluating online imitation learning methods to train open and accessible language models for uncommonsense abductive reasoning. The methods aim to address issues like exposure bias that hurt purely offline supervised training.

4. Demonstrating that the proposed online imitation learning methods consistently improve model performance on both commonsense and uncommonsense abductive reasoning when evaluated by humans.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop models for uncommonsense abductive reasoning, which is addressed through a new task/dataset, analysis of human vs model abilities, and online learning methods to improve accessible models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task and dataset for uncommonsense abductive reasoning. Specifically:

- They introduce the task of uncommonsense abductive reasoning, which involves generating explanations for unlikely or unexpected outcomes given a context. This complements existing commonsense reasoning tasks that focus on more common, everyday situations.

- They create a new dataset called UNcommonsense containing over 20k context-outcome pairs with 41k human-written and LLM-generated explanations. This provides a benchmark for evaluating uncommonsense reasoning.

- They characterize differences between human and LLM performance on this task. Humans generate more diverse but less specific explanations, while LLMs produce more specific but less diverse explanations. Combining the two yields high quality explanations. 

- They propose and experiment with online imitation learning methods to train LLMs for uncommonsense abductive reasoning. These methods outperform standard supervised fine-tuning, especially on uncommonsense examples.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new task, dataset, and learning methods to assess and improve the ability of language models to perform abductive reasoning about uncommon situations. The paper provides both empirical analysis and new training techniques for this previously under-explored area.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few ways this paper compares to other research in the field of uncommonsense reasoning and abductive reasoning:

- It presents a new task and dataset focused specifically on abductive reasoning about uncommon or unlikely situations. Much prior work has focused on abductive reasoning about everyday, commonsense scenarios. Studying uncommon situations presents new challenges.

- The paper introduces a new English-language corpus called UNcommonsense for evaluating models on this task. Many existing commonsense reasoning datasets are multiple choice, whereas this corpus contains 41k free-form textual explanations.

- The authors perform experiments comparing human explanations from crowdworkers to explanations generated by large language models like GPT-3/GPT-4. Most prior work has focused only on model-generated explanations. Analyzing differences between human and model explanations provides new insights. 

- The paper proposes and evaluates online imitation learning methods to improve model performance on this task. Much prior work has used offline supervised learning. Online learning helps address the exposure bias problem during sequence generation.

- The paper evaluates on both commonsense and uncommonsense examples. Many existing datasets only look at commonsense. Testing on both allows analyzing whether improvements generalize.

Overall, this paper introduces a new task formulation, dataset, and learning methods tailored to uncommonsense reasoning. The human evaluation and comparisons provide novel analysis into the strengths and weaknesses of different explanation sources. The online learning experiments also demonstrate improved methods applicable to abductive reasoning more broadly.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future work:

- Develop more effective and affordable automatic evaluation metrics for abductive reasoning tasks. The authors mainly rely on human evaluation which can be costly and less reproducible. Better automatic metrics are needed.

- Explore uncommonsense reasoning in languages other than English. The current work is limited to English examples, so expanding to other languages could reveal interesting cross-lingual differences. 

- Experiment with different methods and models. The authors propose two online imitation learning algorithms, but many other approaches could be explored as well. Trying different models besides the ones in the current work could also be beneficial.

- Create resources with more diversity of uncommon situations beyond what is covered in the current dataset. The authors acknowledge their dataset may lack coverage of certain types of uncommon scenarios. Expanding the diversity could lead to more robust uncommonsense reasoning.

- Study social biases and annotation inconsistencies. The authors acknowledge potential issues with biases and inconsistencies during data collection and labeling. Future work could further analyze these issues and explore mitigation strategies.

- Develop better evaluation methods that don't rely solely on human judgements. The authors use human evaluation for preference judgements, which can be costly. Finding more effective and affordable evaluation techniques would be useful.

In summary, the main future directions are: developing better automatic metrics, expanding to more languages and situations, experimenting with new methods and models, studying potential data issues, and reducing reliance on costly human evaluation. Expanding the scope and scale of uncommonsense reasoning is an overarching goal.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using online imitation learning algorithms like DAgger and behavior cloning with policy gradient to improve language models on uncommonsense abductive reasoning. What are the key advantages of using these online imitation learning algorithms compared to standard supervised learning? How do they help address the exposure bias problem?

2. The paper experiments with two different online imitation learning setups - one where the expert policy (GPT-4) is available during training to provide corrections (EaO), and one where only static expert demonstrations are available (SED). What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches? When would you choose one over the other?

3. The SED method modifies the behavior cloning objective by adding an additional term to minimize the probability of the learner's own samples. Intuitively, why does this help improve performance compared to vanilla behavior cloning? How does it relate to avoiding exposure bias?

4. The EaO algorithm gradually increases the length of the prefix generated by the learner policy in each epoch. Why is this curriculum learning style approach beneficial? How does the prefix length schedule affect the tradeoff between sample efficiency and exposure bias reduction?

5. The paper shows significant improvements from online imitation learning on both commonsense and uncommonsense abductive reasoning benchmarks. Do you expect similar gains on other language generation tasks like summarization or dialogue? Why or why not?

6. Error analysis: What kinds of mistakes do the online imitation learning methods make compared to vanilla supervised learning? Are there any observable patterns?

7. The paper assumes access to a top performing expert model like GPT-4. How would the results change if a weaker expert was used instead? What if the expert demonstrations were noisy or imperfect?

8. Societal impact: Since the paper relies heavily on large language models like GPT-4, how might it exacerbate issues like bias, toxicity, and hallucinated content? How can we mitigate these risks?

9. The paper focuses on English text. How well would these methods transfer to other languages? What challenges might arise?

10. The paper uses human evaluation to compare explanation quality. What are other options for automatically evaluating free-form language generation tasks like this? What are the tradeoffs compared to human assessment?
