# [Topic-oriented Adversarial Attacks against Black-box Neural Ranking   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14867)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate adversarial examples to attack neural ranking models (NRMs) in a black-box setting, such that a target document is promoted in the rankings for a group of queries on the same topic? The key points are:- The paper introduces a new task called "topic-oriented adversarial ranking attack" (TARA) against NRMs. - Given a target document and a group of queries on the same topic, the goal is to craft a small perturbation to the document text such that it gets ranked higher for many or all of the queries, while still preserving semantics and being imperceptible.- This is more challenging than existing "paired" attacks that only try to promote a document for a single query. - The authors focus on black-box attacks where the model internals are not known. Only rankings are observed.- They propose a reinforcement learning framework called RELEVANT to optimize the attack strategy based on topic-oriented rewards from the target model.So in summary, the main research question is how to generate successful topic-oriented adversarial examples against black-box NRMs using reinforcement learning. The key hypothesis is that the proposed RELEVANT framework can outperform existing attack baselines by taking into account rewards related to an entire topic/query group.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing the topic-oriented adversarial ranking attack (TARA) task against neural ranking models (NRMs). This is a more practical attack scenario than existing paired attack settings, where the goal is to promote a target document in rankings for a group of queries with the same topic via small perturbations. 2. Defining static and dynamic settings for the TARA task. The static setting assumes the target NRM stays fixed during attacks. The more challenging dynamic setting assumes the target NRM gets continuously updated, requiring the attack method to adapt accordingly.3. Developing a reinforcement learning-based attack framework called RELEVANT to address the TARA task. It models the interactions between an attacker agent and the target NRM environment as a Markov decision process. The agent aims to optimize a topic-oriented reward function to find successful adversarial examples.4. Conducting comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets to demonstrate the vulnerability of neural ranking models to the proposed attacks. The results show RELEVANT significantly outperforms baseline attack methods in both static and dynamic environments.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the TARA task to evaluate NRMs' robustness against topic-oriented group attacks, and developing a novel RL-based attack method RELEVANT that can effectively fool NRMs in this practical attack setting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my understanding, the main point of the paper is: It proposes a challenging adversarial attack task called TARA against neural ranking models, where the goal is to find a small perturbation to promote a target document in rankings for a group of queries with the same topic, and develops a reinforcement learning-based attack framework to address this task.In one sentence, the TL;DR would be: The paper introduces a new adversarial attack task for document ranking and proposes a reinforcement learning method to generate attacks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in adversarial attacks against neural ranking models:- Focuses on a new attack scenario: This paper introduces the topic-oriented adversarial ranking attack (TARA) task, which aims to find perturbations that can promote a document in rankings for a group of related queries. Prior work has mostly focused on paired attacks for a single query-document pair. The TARA task is more realistic and challenging.- Black-box attack setting: The paper tackles the practical black-box scenario where the model is opaque and only hard-label predictions are available. Many previous adversarial attack papers in IR consider white-box settings with full model access. - Dynamic environment: The paper defines both static and dynamic environments based on corpus updates. Most prior adversarial attack research considers fixed/static models, while this explores the more difficult dynamic case.- Reinforcement learning approach: The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework called RELEVANT to continuously update attacks based on environment interactions. This is a unique approach compared to prior gradient-based or heuristic attack methods.- Evaluation on two new datasets: New benchmark datasets are constructed based on MS MARCO and ClueWeb09 to study the TARA task. Many previous papers just use MS MARCO.- Detailed naturalness evaluation: The paper thoroughly evaluates attack imperceptibility, unlike some prior work. This includes anti-spam detection, grammar checking, and human evaluation.Overall, the paper makes several novel contributions to studying adversarial attacks in IR compared to prior work. The techniques and findings help better understand the vulnerability of neural ranking models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:1. Exploring adaptive determination of the level (character, word, sentence) of adversarial perturbations in RELEVANT for different scenarios and target documents. The authors suggest adapting the type of perturbation based on the specific situation rather than using a fixed approach. 2. Developing universal adversarial ranking attacks to find input-agnostic perturbations against neural ranking models (NRMs). This involves finding perturbations that can fool NRMs in a general, input-independent way rather than being tailored to specific inputs.3. Investigating corresponding defense methods to enhance the robustness of NRMs against adversarial attacks. This involves developing techniques to make NRMs more robust and less vulnerable to adversarial perturbations.4. Going beyond the topic-oriented adversarial ranking attack (TARA) task to explore other types of adversarial attacks against NRMs. The authors suggest the TARA task is a promising start but there may be other useful attack setups to study as well.5. Evaluating the generalization ability of adversarial attack methods by dividing datasets into training/validation/test sets. The current work trains and tests on the full dataset, so exploring generalization is suggested.In summary, the main future directions are developing more adaptive and universal perturbation approaches, investigating defenses, exploring new attack setups beyond TARA, and evaluating generalization ability. The overall goal is to further understand the vulnerabilities of NRMs to adversarial attacks.
