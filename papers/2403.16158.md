# [Korean Bio-Medical Corpus (KBMC) for Medical Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Medical named entity recognition (NER) is important for processing medical text and extracting information. However, there is a lack of medical NER datasets for the Korean language. This is problematic since domain-specific NER requires extensive labeling of specialized entity categories like diseases, body parts, and treatments.

- Currently available Korean NER datasets are general and have limited ability to accurately identify medical terminology. They group medical terms under one vague label along with IT terms. This makes it hard to differentiate medical entities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the Korean Bio-Medical Corpus (KBMC), the first open-source medical NER dataset specifically for Korean. 

- KBMC was constructed by using ChatGPT to generate Korean sentences containing medical terms. Human annotators then labeled sentences for medical named entities (diseases, body parts, treatments) using the BIO annotation scheme.

- The dataset contains over 150K tokens across 6K sentences. It covers 4K distinct disease names, 800 body parts, and 400 treatments.

- KBMC was combined with a general Korean NER dataset (Naver) to create a more balanced corpus for evaluating medical NER performance.

Main Contributions:
- Releases the first publicly available Korean medical NER dataset to address previous lack of resources.

- Demonstrates KBMC allows models to improve F1 scores for medical NER by over 20 points compared to using only general datasets.

- Shows state-of-the-art Korean language models (BERT, ELECTRA) achieve 98% F1 score on KBMC for medical entity detection.

- Proves utility of KBMC by testing on MedSpaCy clinical NLP toolkit and achieving 95% overall performance.

- KBMC facilitates better medical terminology processing and information extraction from Korean medical texts.

In summary, the key innovation is the development of the new KBMC medical NER dataset for Korean. Experiments demonstrate it significantly boosts medical entity recognition compared to general datasets. This will enable more research in Korean medical NLP.
