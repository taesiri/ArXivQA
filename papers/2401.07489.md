## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods like finite element analysis face challenges in mesh generation, solving inverse problems, and require extensive coding.
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer an alternative by incorporating physics into neural network training, but current PINN approaches in fluids are based on the Navier-Stokes equations.
- Variational principles have seen limited use in fluid mechanics compared to other physics domains. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new PINN approach by combining the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG) with PINN. 
- PMPG is a recently developed variational principle for incompressible fluids that asserts the pressure gradient is minimized at all times.
- The new PMPG-PINN method removes dependence on pressure in the loss function, reducing computational cost.
- An augmented Lagrangian method is incorporated to effectively handle constraints.

Contributions:
- First work combining PMPG and PINN for incompressible flow problems
- Demonstrates PMPG-PINN on the lid-driven cavity problem and shows good agreement with standard PINN
- Reduces computational time per epoch by 12% compared to standard PINN
- Provides a potential alternative PINN formulation for complex fluid mechanics problems
- Opens up possibilities for using PMPG-PINN in areas like turbulent flows and fluid-structure interaction

In summary, the key idea is using a recently developed variational principle for fluids called PMPG within a PINN framework. This is shown to reduce computational cost and provide accurate solutions compared to standard PINN. The combination of PMPG and PINN offers a promising new approach for solving challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network approach, called PMPG-PINN, for solving incompressible fluid flow problems that is based on the principle of minimum pressure gradient and demonstrates enhanced computational efficiency compared to conventional methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of a new approach for solving incompressible flow problems by combining the Principle of Minimum Pressure Gradient (PMPG) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). This combined PMPG-PINN framework allows for more efficient training of the neural network by eliminating the pressure gradient from the loss function formulation. Specifically, the key highlights are:

- Proposes using the PMPG principle to inform the loss function of a neural network instead of the traditional Navier-Stokes equations. This eliminates the need to compute pressure gradients, reducing computational cost.

- Incorporates Augmented Lagrangian Multipliers into the PMPG-PINN loss function to effectively balance minimizing the action quantity S while satisfying the continuity constraint. 

- Demonstrates a 12% reduction in training time per epoch with the PMPG-PINN on a lid-driven cavity flow problem compared to traditional PINN, while still achieving accurate velocity field predictions.

- Establishes a computationally efficient alternative to conventional PINN for solving incompressible flow problems, with potential extensions to more complex unsteady and turbulent flows.

In summary, the key innovation is the development of the PMPG-PINN framework itself, which offers improved computational performance over traditional PINN for solving incompressible flow problems.
