# [Bi-CryptoNets: Leveraging Different-Level Privacy for Encrypted   Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01296)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Bi-CryptoNets: Leveraging Different-Level Privacy For Encrypted Inference":

Problem:
- Privacy-preserving neural networks allow performing inference on encrypted data to preserve privacy. However, homomorphic encryption used in these networks is computationally expensive. 
- Prior works apply homomorphic encryption to the entire input data indiscriminately.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving neural network architecture called "bi-CryptoNets" that leverages different privacy levels in input data.

- It decomposes input data (e.g. images) into sensitive (important and private parts like faces) and insensitive (less private background parts) segments. 

- Sensitive segments are encrypted with homomorphic encryption while insensitive parts are perturbed with noise for privacy. This avoids unnecessary encryption.

- The network has two branches - ciphertext branch for sensitive parts and plaintext branch for insensitive parts. Ciphertext branch can use features from plaintext branch through unidirectional connections but not vice versa to prevent spread of ciphertexts.

- A feature-based knowledge distillation method transfers representations from a teacher network trained on original data to the bi-CryptoNets student network.

Main Contributions:
- New privacy-preserving network architecture leveraging different privacy levels in data to reduce computational overhead of homomorphic encryption.

- Decomposition of input data into sensitive and insensitive segments based on privacy levels. Selective application of encryption only to sensitive parts.

- Bi-CryptoNets architecture with ciphertext and plaintext branches for selective processing. Unidirectional connections allow ciphertext branch to use plaintext branch features.

- Feature-based knowledge distillation to improve representations in the bi-CryptoNets student network using teacher network.

- Empirical evaluation shows bi-CryptoNets improves accuracy over baseline while reducing inference latency by 1.15x to 3.43x for single image and 4.59x to 13.7x for a batch.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes bi-CryptoNets, a privacy-preserving neural network with ciphertext and plaintext branches to handle sensitive and insensitive segments of input data respectively, leveraging knowledge distillation to improve performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. The paper decomposes input data (e.g. images) into sensitive and insensitive segments according to importance and privacy. It adopts strong homomorphic encryption to keep the security of the sensitive segment, yet adds perturbations to the insensitive segment. This reduces computational overhead for private inference.

2. The paper proposes the bi-CryptoNets, with ciphertext and plaintext branches to deal with the sensitive and insensitive segments respectively. The ciphertext branch can utilize information from the plaintext branch via unidirectional connections, but not vice versa due to spread of ciphertexts.  

3. The paper presents a feature-based knowledge distillation method to improve the performance of the bi-CryptoNets, by transferring representations from a teacher convolutional neural network trained on the entire data without decomposition. 

4. The paper provides empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-CryptoNets in terms of accuracy, inference latency, and amortized latency over batches of images. The results show improved accuracy and significant decreases in latency compared to prior privacy-preserving networks.

In summary, the key innovation is the decomposition of input data and bi-branch network structure to reduce computational overhead of homomorphic encryption, while still preserving privacy and accuracy. The knowledge distillation further improves performance.

The paper proposes a privacy-preserving neural network architecture called "Bi-CryptoNets" which leverages the decomposition of input data (e.g. images) into sensitive and insensitive segments. It uses homomorphic encryption only for the sensitive segments while adding perturbations to the insensitive segments. The Bi-CryptoNets consist of two branches - ciphertext and plaintext - to process the two types of segments separately, with unidirectional connections to allow the ciphertext branch to utilize features from the plaintext branch. Knowledge distillation is used to improve the representations learned by the two branches. Experiments show improved accuracy and reduced inference latency compared to prior privacy-preserving networks.
