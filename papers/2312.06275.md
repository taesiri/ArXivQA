# [DG-TTA: Out-of-domain medical image segmentation through Domain   Generalization and Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06275)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called DG-TTA that combines domain generalization (DG) and test-time adaptation (TTA) to enable accurate out-of-domain medical image segmentation with minimal data constraints. The key idea is to first pre-train a model on labeled source data using DG techniques like the proposed MIND descriptor to maximize performance on unseen target data. Then at test-time, TTA is applied by optimizing the model on a single unlabeled target image to output consistent segmentations under different augmentations. This allows leveraging source data without needing access later and adapting to new target scans without labels. Experiments across CT, MRI, and modalities demonstrate that DG-TTA with aTotalSegmentator model can effectively segment out-of-domain organs, spine, and cardiac images. The method is integrated into nnU-Net for easy application and outperforms related domain adaptation approaches. By removing data availability barriers, DG-TTA facilitates reuse of pre-trained models to obtain high-quality segmentation even for single new scans.
