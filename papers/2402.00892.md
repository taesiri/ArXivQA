## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Existing GAN-based neural vocoders face challenges such as spectral discontinuities, blurriness in high frequencies, and lack of robustness against out-of-domain data. These limitations restrict their applicability to diverse use cases like music and singing generation.

- There is a lack of large-scale models and datasets in the audio generation domain. Previous efforts have not extended into high-fidelity 44.1kHz domain.

- There is an absence of effective objective metrics to automatically assess artifacts, especially those imperceptible to humans, in neural vocoders. 

Proposed Solution - EVA-GAN
- Presents EVA-GAN, a vocoder that yields significant improvements in spectral and high-frequency reconstruction and out-of-domain robustness.

- Employs an extensive 36,000 hour 44.1kHz dataset, a context-aware module, and scales model to ~200 million parameters.

- Introduces a Human-In-The-Loop artifact measurement toolkit to continuously monitor audio quality against human perception.

Key Contributions
- Utilizes the largest model (200M parameters) and dataset (36,000 hours) in neural vocoders to date.

- Proposes a novel context-aware module that enhances model capacity with minimal overhead.

- Introduces innovative training paradigm with longer context, loss balancing, activation optimizations etc.

- Builds a Human-In-The-Loop evaluation toolkit to ensure alignment with human audio perceptions.

- Sets new benchmarks in hi-fidelity neural vocoding, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Overall, the paper makes pivotal contributions in scaling and enhancing neural vocoders to achieve superior high-fidelity audio generation quality and out-of-domain robustness.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) The introduction of EVA-GAN, a scalable generative adversarial network (GAN) for high-fidelity audio generation. Key aspects include:

- Scaling up to the largest model (200 million parameters) and dataset (36,000 hours) used in a neural vocoder to date.

- Proposing a novel context-aware module (CAM) that improves performance with minimal overhead. 

- Optimizing the training pipeline, including a longer context window, loss balancing, activation functions, etc. to improve stability.

2) Achieving state-of-the-art performance in spectral reconstruction, high-frequency detail, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Quantitative and qualitative results on test datasets demonstrate superiority over previous vocoders.
