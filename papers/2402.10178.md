# [TDAG: A Multi-Agent Framework based on Dynamic Task Decomposition and   Agent Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10178)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing AI agents struggle with complex, real-world tasks requiring planning, reasoning and tool use. Methodological constraints like error propagation and limited adaptability contribute to poor performance.  
- Current benchmarks lack granularity in evaluation metrics to reflect incremental progress in multi-step tasks. Binary scoring of success/failure overlooks partial successes.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new benchmark, ItineraryBench, focused on agent-assisted travel planning. Features progressive complexity across tasks and a fine-grained, multi-level evaluation system.
- Propose a multi-agent framework, TDAG, based on dynamic task decomposition and agent generation. Complex tasks are broken down into subtasks, with each assigned to a specialized subagent. Subtasks are dynamically updated based on preceding outcomes.

Key Contributions:
- ItineraryBench benchmark with interconnected travel planning tasks of increasing complexity and a nuanced scoring system assessing executability, constraint compliance and efficiency.
- TDAG framework enabling flexible adaptation in complex tasks through dynamic decomposition and customization of subagents.
- Experiments showing TDAG significantly outperforms baselines on ItineraryBench. Additional tests demonstrate generalization capability.
- Analysis of common errors, highlighting TDAG's strength in mitigating cascading failures. Comparison with binary scoring proves value of fine-grained assessment.

In summary, the paper introduces a new benchmark and multi-agent framework to push the boundaries of LLM-based agents in complex, real-world planning and reasoning tasks. A core innovation is the dynamic and customized decomposition of problems to enhance adaptability. The presented experiments and analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a multi-agent framework (TDAG) that dynamically decomposes complex travel planning tasks into smaller subtasks, with each subtask assigned to a specifically generated subagent, and also presents a new benchmark (ItineraryBench) with fine-grained evaluation of agents on interconnected, progressively complex travel planning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The development of a new benchmark called ItineraryBench for evaluating LLM-based agents on complex, real-world tasks related to travel planning. This benchmark features interconnected, progressively challenging tasks and a nuanced evaluation system that goes beyond binary scoring to assess partial task completion.

2. The introduction of a multi-agent framework called TDAG (Task Decomposition and Agent Generation) that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into smaller subtasks and generates customized subagents to handle each subtask. This enhances flexibility and efficiency compared to relying on a single agent or predefined subagents.

3. Experimental results demonstrating that the TDAG framework significantly outperforms existing baseline methods on the ItineraryBench benchmark as well as other datasets like WebShop and TextCraft. This showcases the effectiveness of TDAG's dynamic task decomposition and agent generation approach.

In summary, the main contributions are a new benchmark, a novel multi-agent framework, and experimental validation of the proposed framework's capabilities in complex, real-world problem solving scenarios.
