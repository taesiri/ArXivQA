# [QVHighlights: Detecting Moments and Highlights in Videos via Natural   Language Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09609)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How to develop effective methods for detecting customized moments and highlights from videos given natural language user queries?The authors aim to address the lack of annotated datasets and strong baseline models for this task. Their key contributions are:1) Collecting a new dataset called QVHighlights with over 10K YouTube videos annotated with free-form natural language queries, relevant moments, and saliency scores.2) Proposing Moment-DETR, an end-to-end transformer encoder-decoder model for joint moment retrieval and highlight detection. 3) Showing that Moment-DETR is competitive with highly engineered baselines, and substantially outperforms them when pretrained on weakly supervised ASR captions.4) Providing detailed analyses, ablations and visualizations to understand the dataset characteristics and model.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that their proposed dataset and Moment-DETR model can effectively address the task of query-based video moment retrieval and highlight detection. The paper aims to demonstrate this through quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset, which contains over 10,000 YouTube videos annotated with free-form natural language queries, relevant moments, and saliency scores. This supports both moment retrieval and highlight detection.2. A new model called Moment-DETR, which is an end-to-end transformer encoder-decoder architecture for joint moment retrieval and highlight detection. It eliminates the need for hand-crafted components like proposal generation and non-maximum suppression.3. Detailed dataset analysis comparing QVHighlights to prior datasets. The moments have less temporal bias and multiple disjoint moments are annotated per query. 4. Ablation studies and visualizations analyzing Moment-DETR, including design choices and a weakly supervised pretraining strategy using ASR captions.5. State-of-the-art results on QVHighlights and the CharadesSTA dataset using Moment-DETR, especially with weakly supervised pretraining.In summary, the key contributions appear to be the new dataset, the Moment-DETR model, in-depth experiments/analysis, and strong results on multiple benchmarks. The work provides a unified framework for moment retrieval and highlight detection.
