# [QVHighlights: Detecting Moments and Highlights in Videos via Natural   Language Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09609)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How to develop effective methods for detecting customized moments and highlights from videos given natural language user queries?The authors aim to address the lack of annotated datasets and strong baseline models for this task. Their key contributions are:1) Collecting a new dataset called QVHighlights with over 10K YouTube videos annotated with free-form natural language queries, relevant moments, and saliency scores.2) Proposing Moment-DETR, an end-to-end transformer encoder-decoder model for joint moment retrieval and highlight detection. 3) Showing that Moment-DETR is competitive with highly engineered baselines, and substantially outperforms them when pretrained on weakly supervised ASR captions.4) Providing detailed analyses, ablations and visualizations to understand the dataset characteristics and model.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that their proposed dataset and Moment-DETR model can effectively address the task of query-based video moment retrieval and highlight detection. The paper aims to demonstrate this through quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The introduction of the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset, which contains over 10,000 YouTube videos annotated with free-form natural language queries, relevant moments, and saliency scores. This supports both moment retrieval and highlight detection.2. A new model called Moment-DETR, which is an end-to-end transformer encoder-decoder architecture for joint moment retrieval and highlight detection. It eliminates the need for hand-crafted components like proposal generation and non-maximum suppression.3. Detailed dataset analysis comparing QVHighlights to prior datasets. The moments have less temporal bias and multiple disjoint moments are annotated per query. 4. Ablation studies and visualizations analyzing Moment-DETR, including design choices and a weakly supervised pretraining strategy using ASR captions.5. State-of-the-art results on QVHighlights and the CharadesSTA dataset using Moment-DETR, especially with weakly supervised pretraining.In summary, the key contributions appear to be the new dataset, the Moment-DETR model, in-depth experiments/analysis, and strong results on multiple benchmarks. The work provides a unified framework for moment retrieval and highlight detection.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper presents a new dataset for detecting video moments and highlights from natural language queries, proposes a transformer-based model for this task, and analyzes the dataset and model performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of natural language video moment retrieval and highlight detection:- The proposed QVHighlights dataset is one of the largest and most diverse for this task, with over 10,000 YouTube videos covering a wide range of topics. It has more comprehensive annotations than prior datasets, with multiple disjoint moments per query and detailed 5-point saliency scores. This allows for more robust model training and evaluation.- The Moment-DETR model eliminates the need for handcrafted components like proposal generators and NMS, taking a direct set prediction approach. This is in line with recent advances in object detection like DETR, but novel for the video moment retrieval task. Without human priors, Moment-DETR achieves competitive performance to highly engineered methods.- Weakly supervised pretraining of Moment-DETR using ASR captions further improves performance and sets new state-of-the-art results on QVHighlights and Charades-STA. This demonstrates the effectiveness of large-scale pretraining for this task.- Most prior work focused on either moment retrieval or highlight detection separately. This paper proposes a unified model capable of joint moment localization and saliency prediction. Experiments show saliency detection benefits moment retrieval.  - Detailed analyses and ablations are provided on the dataset statistics, model design choices, and effect of pretraining data. This provides useful insights to guide future research.Overall, the large annotated dataset, novel end-to-end model design, state-of-the-art results, and extensive analyses advance the field meaningfully compared to prior work. The model simplicity and weak supervision strategy also point to promising research directions.
