# [DMAD: Dual Memory Bank for Real-World Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12362)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world anomaly detection faces two challenges: (1) a general unified (multi-class) setting where only normal data from multiple object classes is available for training, and (2) a unified semi-supervised setting where a few annotated anomalies also become available over time. 
- Existing methods either train separate models per object which is not scalable, or only address the unified unsupervised setting, failing to utilize accessible anomalies.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel framework called DMAD (Dual Memory bank enhanced representation learning for Anomaly Detection) that handles both unified unsupervised and semi-supervised settings in a single model.

- Key idea is to use a dual memory bank comprising a normal memory bank and an abnormal memory bank to introduce useful knowledge about normal and abnormal patterns. 

- In unified unsupervised setting, the abnormal bank stores pseudo-abnormal features obtained by fusing outlier textures with normal features. 

- In unified semi-supervised setting, an anomaly center sampling strategy is used to expand the abnormal bank with observed anomalies and more pseudo-abnormal features.

- For any input, nearest normal and abnormal memories are retrieved, and distance and attention between them is computed as knowledge. This knowledge enhances the final representation for anomaly score prediction.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes first framework DMAD that handles both unified unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, aligned with real-world requirements.

- Introduces a flexible dual memory bank strategy to construct useful knowledge about normality and anomaly patterns.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets under varying anomaly supervision levels.

- Analysis shows defects from one object class can aid anomaly detection in other classes, validating importance of unified semi-supervised setting.

In summary, the paper presents a novel dual memory bank approach for unified semi-supervised anomaly detection that push the performance boundaries and better aligns with real-world anomaly detection needs.
