# [Identity-Obscured Neural Radiance Fields: Privacy-Preserving 3D Facial   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04106)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for reconstructing detailed 3D facial geometry using neural radiance fields while preserving privacy. The key idea is to classify input images into "privacy-neutral" and "privacy-preserving" categories. Privacy-neutral images like the back of the head are used in stage one to establish basic facial geometry. In stage two, privacy-preserving frontal images undergo irreversible processing to obscure identity details while retaining color variation information. This protects privacy while allowing refinement of geometric details supervised by a novel gradient loss. Experiments demonstrate the method balances privacy protection and accuracy, reconstructing intricacies comparable to methods using full facial images. The work pioneers privacy-conscious facial reconstruction, providing solutions to address user concerns over potential misuse of facial data. It underscores future opportunities to advance security and ethics by avoiding direct exposure of private information.
