# [A Multilevel Guidance-Exploration Network and Behavior-Scene Matching   Method for Human Behavior Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04119)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised video anomaly detection framework called the Multilevel Guidance-Exploration Network (MGENet) that detects various types of anomalies by exploring feature differences rather than reconstructing or predicting low-level features. The framework has two levels - the first uses a pre-trained Normalizing Flow model on skeletal pose data to guide an RGB Encoder to capture motion features from RGB frames. Anomalies are detected by comparing these motion features from the two networks. The second level uses the RGB Encoder to guide a Mask Encoder on masked RGB frames to learn appearance features. Anomalies are identified based on similarity of output features between the two networks. Additionally, a Behavior-Scene Matching Module is proposed to capture relationships between normal behavior patterns and scenes to enable detecting scene-related anomalies. Experiments on two datasets - ShanghaiTech and UBnormal show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploring high-level feature differences for anomaly detection rather than pixel-level reconstruction or prediction. Key advantages are the ability to detect various types of anomalies including motion, appearance and scene-related anomalies in videos.
