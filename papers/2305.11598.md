# [Introspective Tips: Large Language Model for In-Context Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11598)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a framework to enhance the decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex reinforcement learning environments like text-based games?More specifically, the paper explores using "introspective tips" generated through prompting the LLM to summarize and learn from past experiences, expert demonstrations, and multiple games. This allows the LLM agent to optimize and adapt its policy without additional training. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) LLMs have sufficient expressive capacity to emulate expert policies for decision-making if provided the right prompt.2) Learning generalized tips through introspection and prompting will improve the LLM's decision-making abilities in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. 3) A framework can be developed to dynamically adjust prompts based on past trajectories, enhancing adaptability without manual effort.4) Introspective tips will enable knowledge transfer across different LLM agents and environments, improving generalization.In essence, the central research question revolves around developing and evaluating methods to exploit the strengths of LLMs for sample-efficient, adaptable, and generalizable decision-making in complex environments like text games. The core hypothesis is that introspective tips generated via prompting will unlock the LLM's potential for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a new framework called "Introspective Tips" to improve the decision-making capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents. The key ideas are:- Introducing the concept of introspective tips, which are condensed and high-level pieces of advice that can be generated from analyzing past trajectories and experiences. These tips aim to provide useful guidance to enhance decision-making.- Developing strategies for an LLM agent to learn introspective tips in different scenarios - by self-reflecting on its own past trajectories, learning from expert demonstrations, and generalizing tips across multiple games/environments. - Using introspective tips as prompts when querying the LLM to guide its decision-making without needing to fine-tune the LLM parameters.- Proposing a framework to dynamically adjust prompts based on extracted tips to simplify prompt engineering. - Demonstrating through experiments in text-based games that this approach can improve LLM few-shot and zero-shot decision performance compared to prior methods.In summary, the main contribution is presenting introspective tips as a new paradigm to exploit the strengths of LLMs for more effective decision-making in reinforcement learning settings without extra training. The key innovation seems to be enabling LLMs to self-optimize and adapt via learning generalized tips through introspection.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in natural language processing for text-based games:- It focuses on using large language models (LLMs) as agents for decision-making and action selection directly in text-based game environments. This differs from some other approaches that use LLMs for plan generation or as supplementary components alongside reinforcement learning agents. The direct grounding of LLMs for interactive decision-making is a relatively new area of exploration.- The concept of "introspective tips" is novel compared to prior work. Other methods like chain-of-thought reasoning and reflexive/reflective prompting explore related ideas of leveraging LLMs' capabilities for multi-step reasoning, but introspective tips specifically aim to provide concise, high-level guidance for self-improvement.- The techniques presented for learning from past experience, expert demonstrations, and multiple training games demonstrate how introspective tips can enable generalization and transfer learning. This contrasts with approaches that train agents from scratch on individual games. The focus on few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios is also notable.- The framework for dynamic prompt adjustment sets this work apart from research relying solely on manual prompt engineering. Automatically refining prompts based on past trajectories makes the agent more adaptive.- The comprehensive experiments on a large number of diverse text-based games provide more robust evaluation compared to some other studies in this emerging field. The comparative results against state-of-the-art methods are promising.Overall, the concepts and techniques introduced seem innovative compared to prior text-game agents. There are shared high-level goals around leveraging LLMs for reasoning and generalization, but the specifics of the introspective tips paradigm and prompt adjustment framework appear unique and worthy of further exploration based on the initial results presented. More investigation is still needed to fully assess and extend this approach.
