# [Introspective Tips: Large Language Model for In-Context Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11598)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a framework to enhance the decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex reinforcement learning environments like text-based games?More specifically, the paper explores using "introspective tips" generated through prompting the LLM to summarize and learn from past experiences, expert demonstrations, and multiple games. This allows the LLM agent to optimize and adapt its policy without additional training. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) LLMs have sufficient expressive capacity to emulate expert policies for decision-making if provided the right prompt.2) Learning generalized tips through introspection and prompting will improve the LLM's decision-making abilities in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. 3) A framework can be developed to dynamically adjust prompts based on past trajectories, enhancing adaptability without manual effort.4) Introspective tips will enable knowledge transfer across different LLM agents and environments, improving generalization.In essence, the central research question revolves around developing and evaluating methods to exploit the strengths of LLMs for sample-efficient, adaptable, and generalizable decision-making in complex environments like text games. The core hypothesis is that introspective tips generated via prompting will unlock the LLM's potential for this task.
