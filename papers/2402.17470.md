# [Bit Distribution Study and Implementation of Spatial Quality Map in the   JPEG-AI Standardization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17470)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- JPEG-AI verification model (VM) 3.4 shows over 10% BD-rate gain over VVC intra coding. This is attributed to its flexible bit distribution in the spatial domain. 
- However, analysis of the bit distribution maps (BDM) shows that VVC actually has more variance in its spatial bit distribution compared to JPEG-AI VM, due to use of variational block sizes.
- So the performance gain of JPEG-AI VM over VVC cannot be simply attributed to more flexible bit distribution.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement a spatial quality index map in JPEG-AI VM to enable adaptive spatial bit allocation. 
- The quality index map assigns different quantization steps to different 16x16 blocks of the image.  
- Higher (positive) index values allocate more bits to a block and lower (negative) index values reduce bit allocation.
- The index map is predicted and entropy coded before sending to decoder.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing VVC has more adaptive spatial bit distribution compared to JPEG-AI VM, despite use of neural networks and fixed block size transforms.
- Proposal for spatial quality index map to enable block-level bit allocation in JPEG-AI VM.
- Demonstration of JPEG-AI VM quality improvement through use of quality index map for ROI coding and mimicking VVC bit distribution.
- Overall, the paper highlights the potential for further JPEG-AI VM optimization through more flexible spatial bit allocation strategies.
