# [RIS-Based On-the-Air Semantic Communications -- a Diffractional Deep   Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00535)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel paradigm for semantic communications using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to enable on-the-air diffractional deep neural networks (D2NNs). Instead of performing semantic encoding and decoding on digital hardware, the authors suggest implementing complex-valued convolutional neural networks (CvCNNs) directly on wireless signals as they pass through RIS layers. This RIS-based approach offers appealing benefits compared to mainstream hardware-based methods, including light-speed computation unaffected by neural network complexity, support for concurrent tasks, low power consumption, high security from separated data-control flows, and real-time programmability. To demonstrate feasibility, the authors utilize an image transmission example with the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing improved resilience against varying channel conditions and signal-to-noise ratios compared to a traditional joint source-channel coding scheme. Although manufacturing limitations pose challenges regarding consecutive phase adjustment, nonlinear transformations, and power loss, the proposed RIS-based on-the-air semantic communication paradigm enables wireless AI and significantly advances existing semantic communication capabilities.
