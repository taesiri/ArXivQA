# [User Friendly and Adaptable Discriminative AI: Using the Lessons from   the Success of LLMs and Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Discriminative AI models currently lack the adaptability and user-friendliness of modern generative AI models like chatGPT. This makes them harder to use and less likely to be adopted.

- Two issues identified are:
   1) Lack of real-time user feedback and model updating
   2) Separate annotation process rather than end-user labeling 

- This leads to lower performance, user trust issues, and algorithm aversion.

Solution:
- Propose a new discriminative AI system architecture focused on real-time adaptability and user-friendliness. 

- Two feedback loops: developer tunes model, user provides data/feedback.

- Users can flag errors and provide corrections using natural language. Models update immediately.

- Iterative fine-tuning process continuously improves model based on user feedback.

Benefits:
- Improves adaptability - models stay updated with user needs and data shifts.

- Increases user-friendliness - intuitive interfaces and ability to shape model.

- Boosts user trust and reduces algorithm aversion.

- Maintains efficiency of discriminative models unlike generative models.

- Overall makes discriminative AI more useful, relevant and widely adoptable.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of strengths/weaknesses of current discriminative vs generative AI

- Proposal of new discriminative architecture focused on real-time adaptability and user-friendliness

- Argument this can make discriminative AI as successful as generative AI
