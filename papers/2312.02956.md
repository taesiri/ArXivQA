# [Choroidalyzer: An open-source, end-to-end pipeline for choroidal   analysis in optical coherence tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02956)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Choroidalyzer, a novel open-source pipeline for comprehensive automated analysis of the choroid in OCT images. Choroidalyzer uses a deep learning model to segment the choroidal region, vessels, and fovea location, enabling automated computation of clinically useful choroidal metrics like thickness, area, and vascular index. Trained on a diverse dataset of 5,600 scans across 233 subjects, 6 disease groups, and multiple OCT devices, Choroidalyzer achieved excellent performance, segmenting the choroid region with a Dice coefficient of 0.9749 and vessels at 0.8703 (external test set). Derived choroidal metrics showed strong agreement with manual measurements (thickness MAE 8.1Î¼m; area MAE 0.0487mm2; vascular index MAE 0.0306). Choroidalyzer matched inter-grader reliability and significantly outperformed manual segmentation in speed, taking just 0.3 seconds per scan. As an integrated, end-to-end solution that is fast, accurate, and openly available, Choroidalyzer can enable large-scale choroidal analysis and standardization across centers, advancing research and clinical care.
