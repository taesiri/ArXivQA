# [DOCTR: Disentangled Object-Centric Transformer for Point Scene   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16431)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the task of point scene understanding, which aims to simultaneously segment object instances in a 3D scene point cloud, estimate the pose of each object, and reconstruct its complete 3D mesh. This is a challenging task especially for real-world scenes with multiple objects in close proximity and incomplete observations due to occlusions and sensor noise. Existing methods like RfD-Net and DIMR have complex pipelines that first segment objects then process each one independently, making it difficult to leverage relationships between objects.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Disentangled Object-Centric Transformer (DOCTR) to represent the scene using object-centric queries that attend to point features extracted by a backbone network. Each query is disentangled into semantic and geometric parts to enable specialized learning. A Transformer decoder optimizes the queries involving their relationships. A prediction head outputs instance masks, classes, poses and shape codes. The shape code reconstructs the complete mesh aligned by the estimated pose.  

Main Contributions:
- Introduces an object-centric Transformer for point scene understanding to enable unified learning of multiple objects and tasks
- Proposes a semantic-geometry disentangled query design that allows separate attention to extract specialized features for different tasks 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet dataset, especially for complex scenes with nearby objects
- Has a more compact pipeline compared to prior arts like DIMR
- Qualitative results show accurate segmentation, pose and shape even for difficult cases
