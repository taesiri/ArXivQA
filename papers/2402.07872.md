# [PIVOT: Iterative Visual Prompting Elicits Actionable Knowledge for VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Vision language models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning. However, they still only produce textual outputs, which limits their ability to solve spatial tasks like robotic control that require outputting continuous coordinates, actions or trajectories. The key question is - how can we enable VLMs to handle such spatial tasks without requiring task-specific fine-tuning?

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel visual prompting approach called "Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization" (PIVOT). The key idea is to cast spatial tasks like robotic control as iterative visual question answering problems. In each iteration, the input image is annotated with visual representations of proposal actions (e.g. candidate robot actions). The VLM is then queried to select the best proposals. These proposals are iteratively refined by fitting a distribution to the VLM's selections and sampling new proposals from that distribution. After several iterations, the VLM zeros in on a precise action.

Key Contributions:
1) A general algorithm - PIVOT - to extract spatial outputs from VLMs by framing tasks as iterative optimization over visually grounded choice selection.

2) Demonstrated applications in several domains like real-world robotic navigation and manipulation, following language instructions in simulation, and spatial inference via keypoint localization, all without any domain-specific fine-tuning.

3) An analysis of capabilities and limitations of current VLMs on spatial and robotic tasks. Identified key challenges around 3D understanding, fine-grained control, greedy behavior and vision-language connection failures.

4) Experiments showing PIVOT scales well with larger VLMs, suggesting it could leverage future progress in foundation models for spatial reasoning.

In summary, the paper presents a novel prompting based approach to adapt VLMs for spatial tasks and demonstrates promising zero-shot control of real robots. It also provides useful insights into current limitations that can guide future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PIVOT, an iterative visual prompting approach for extracting spatial outputs from vision language models by representing candidate actions as visual annotations in the image and having the model iteratively select good proposals to converge on a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an iterative visual prompting approach called "Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization" (PIVOT) that enables vision language models (VLMs) to handle spatial reasoning tasks like robotic control without any task-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, PIVOT casts tasks as iterative visual question answering where candidate solutions (e.g. robot actions, trajectories) are visually annotated on the image and the VLM selects the best ones through multiple rounds of refinement. This allows the VLM to produce continuous spatial outputs for control and reasoning problems in a zero-shot setting. The paper shows applications of this approach to real-world robot navigation and manipulation, simulation instruction following, and other spatial inference tasks, analyzing the potentials and limitations. The key contribution is demonstrating a promising way to apply large VLMs to physical spatial reasoning problems without modification or in-domain training data.

The paper proposes an iterative visual prompting approach called "Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization" (PIVOT) to enable VLMs to handle spatial reasoning tasks like robotic control without any task-specific training. Key aspects include visually representing potential actions on the image, querying the VLM to select good options, refining the distribution, and repeating to converge on a solution.

The paper analyzes the potential and limitations of this zero-shot VLM control approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative optimization method called PIVOT. Can you explain in detail the full algorithm and how the different components (sampling actions, projecting actions, querying VLM, fitting new distribution) work together in each iteration? 

2. One key idea in PIVOT is representing spatial concepts like robot actions visually in the image space. Can you discuss the motivations behind this idea and why it helps connect spatial tasks to VLMs? What are other potential ways spatial concepts could be grounded to VLMs?

3. The paper evaluates PIVOT on several robot platforms for navigation and manipulation. Can you compare and contrast the action spaces, state representations, and metrics used for the mobile manipulator, Franka arm and RAVENS experiments? What insights do the different experiments provide?

4. Parallel calls are used in PIVOT to improve robustness. Explain this technique and analyze why and how much it improves performance over a single PIVOT instance based on the offline and online experiments. 

5. The paper identifies several limitations of current VLMs that affect PIVOT, including lack of 3D understanding, challenges with occlusion and interaction, greedy behaviors, and connection reasoning errors. Pick one and analyze the specific failure modes, provide hypotheses on their causes, and suggest ways to alleviate them.

6. An analysis is provided on how different text prompt styles (e.g. zero-shot, few-shot, chain of thought) impact performance of PIVOT. Summarize this analysis and discuss the tradeoffs of different prompting approaches for this method.

7. The paper shows PIVOT scales to larger VLMs, improving performance. Speculate on what capabilities are still lacking in current VLMs that limit spatial reasoning performance and how architectural or algorithmic improvements to future VLMs could benefit PIVOT.

8. The visual prompting mapping plays a key role in grounding spatial concepts to language. Analyze the sensitivity of VLMs to different visual annotation designs based on the arrow robustness experiments. How could the visual representation be improved?

9. Compare PIVOT to other methods that have applied foundation models to robot control tasks. What are unique advantages and disadvantages of the visually grounded prompting approach?

10. The paper focuses on a zero-shot prompting approach without task-specific finetuning. Discuss the tradeoffs of this approach vs finetuning. In what ways could in-domain supervision further improve performance if combined with PIVOT?
