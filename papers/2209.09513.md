# [Learn to Explain: Multimodal Reasoning via Thought Chains for Science   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09513)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. Can we construct a large-scale, multimodal science question answering dataset with rich domain diversity and annotated explanations to facilitate research on multi-hop reasoning?

2. Can language models be trained to generate coherent explanations that reveal the reasoning process (chain of thought) for answering science questions? 

3. Does training language models to produce explanations as a chain of thought improve their reasoning abilities and performance on science QA?

4. Does providing explanations help language models learn more efficiently from less data, similar to how explanations aid human learning?

Specifically, the authors aim to construct a new dataset called ScienceQA that contains over 21k science questions spanning diverse topics and modalities. They further explore whether large language models like GPT-3 and UnifiedQA can be trained to produce lectures and explanations that mimic human reasoning chains. The key hypotheses are that (1) generating explanations will improve model performance on ScienceQA compared to just predicting answers, and (2) explanations will allow the models to learn from less data. The authors test these hypotheses through experiments on few-shot prompting of GPT-3 and fine-tuning of UnifiedQA. Overall, the goal is to endow AI systems with more human-like reasoning and learning abilities for science QA.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new dataset called ScienceQA, which contains 21,208 multimodal multiple choice science questions with rich domain diversity. It is the first large-scale multimodal science question dataset that annotates lectures and explanations for the answers. 

2. Showing that using a chain of thought (CoT) by generating lectures and explanations along with answers improves the reasoning ability and performance of large language models like UnifiedQA and GPT-3 on this dataset, in both few-shot and fine-tuning settings.

3. Analyzing the upper bound of GPT-3 performance by feeding in gold explanations, and showing that CoT helps language models learn more efficiently from fewer examples.

In summary, the key contribution is the new ScienceQA dataset for multimodal reasoning, along with analyses showing the utility of chain of thought and explanations in improving language model performance on this scientific QA task. The paper provides both the dataset and modeling innovations to advance multimodal reasoning and interpretability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper introduces Science Question Answering (ScienceQA), a new multimodal question answering dataset for science domains, and shows that incorporating explanations and reasoning chains improves model performance on this challenging benchmark.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of multimodal science question answering and reasoning:

- The key contribution of this paper is the new ScienceQA dataset, which contains over 21k multimodal multiple choice science questions across diverse domains. This is much larger in scale compared to previous multimodal science QA datasets like AI2D, DVQA, VLQA, etc.

- Most prior work has focused only on natural science topics, whereas ScienceQA covers natural science, social science, and language science questions. This adds more domain diversity. 

- Many existing science QA datasets lack annotated reasoning chains/explanations for the answers. ScienceQA provides lectures and detailed explanations grounded in the questions to reveal the reasoning process. This is a novel aspect not seen in other related datasets.

- The paper shows that current VQA models underperform on ScienceQA compared to human performance, highlighting the challenges of multimodal reasoning on this dataset.

- The key method explored is using chain of thought prompting with large language models like GPT-3 and UnifiedQA. Showing CoT improves performance over baseline prompting is a nice result, consistent with findings in other recent work.

- Analysis of the value of explanations, and how CoT helps models learn from less data is interesting and not explored much before in the context of science QA.

Overall, the ScienceQA dataset itself is the biggest contribution here in advancing multimodal science QA compared to prior work. The CoT methods and analysis help establish strong baselines on this new dataset and provide useful insights. But the core value is in introducing ScienceQA as a valuable benchmark for future research in advanced multimodal reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the multi-modal reasoning ability of models on the ScienceQA dataset, as there is still a significant gap between model performance and human performance. The authors suggest this is an important direction for future research on multimodal understanding and reasoning.

- Better utilizing explanations and the chain of thought to aid reasoning in language models, as the authors show that providing explanations improves performance but there is still room for improvement. Areas to explore include generating more accurate and complete explanations. 

- Applying the chain of thought framework to other tasks and domains beyond science QA, to see if it generalizes. The authors suggest it could be a useful paradigm for imbuing models with more human-like reasoning.

- Exploring other ways for models to learn more efficiently from less data, since the authors show the chain of thought allows models to learn from fewer examples. Other techniques like meta-learning could be combined with the chain of thought.

- Addressing the limitations and failure cases of current models on ScienceQA, for example by improving reasoning with complex domain knowledge and diagram-style images.

- Expanding the ScienceQA dataset to even more subjects, grades, and modalities to further advance research on scientific reasoning.

In summary, the main directions are improving reasoning and explanation abilities, generalizing the chain of thought framework, learning efficiently from less data, addressing model limitations, and expanding the ScienceQA dataset. The authors frame ScienceQA as an important benchmark for advancing multimodal understanding and reasoning in AI.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to help GPT-3 generate explanations alongside answers. How exactly does the CoT prompting work? Does it provide any in-context examples to GPT-3? If so, how are those examples formatted?

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in this paper: 

This paper presents Science Question Answering (ScienceQA), a new multimodal question answering dataset for science domains with over 21k examples. Each example contains a multiple choice question, multimodal contexts like images and text, the correct answer, and annotated lectures/explanations that provide reasoning chains. The authors benchmark current state-of-the-art models like VisualBERT and UnifiedQA, and find that they struggle on this challenging dataset.
