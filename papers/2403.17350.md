# [The Solution of the Zodiac Killer's 340-Character Cipher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The Zodiac Killer was an unidentified serial killer who operated in Northern California in the late 1960s. Besides his murders, he was known for sending taunting letters containing encrypted ciphers to the press. 
- One of these ciphers, known as Z340, had resisted all deciphering attempts for over 51 years and was on the FBI's top unsolved cipher list. Cryptanalysts had long suspected Z340 used a more complex encipherment scheme beyond simple letter substitution.

Proposed Solution
- The authors collaborated over several years to methodically test different cipher schemes on Z340, focusing on ones involving transpositions as well as substitutions. 
- They discovered Z340 had been enciphered in sections using a combination of homophonic letter substitution and a diagonal transposition scheme. One section also contained an error that garbled part of the plaintext. 
- By cribbing in key plaintext fragments first found in partial decryptions, they broke the substitution scheme. Applying corrections for the errors enabled deciphering the full 340 character ciphertext.

Key Contributions
- The paper documents the historical significance and prior solution attempts for Z340.
- It provides a detailed account of the cryptanalysis techniques and collaboration that finally solved this 51-year old unsolved cipher.
- The solution revealed Z340's plaintext contained no clues to the killer's identity, just more taunting messages, but closed a significant chapter in the Zodiac killer investigation.
- The paper analyzes Zodiac's encipherment methods and security via obscurity approach that protected Z340 for so long.
- It suggests enhancements to cryptanalysis tools to handle complex hybrid ciphers like Z340 more automatically in future.
