# [Improving 3D Imaging with Pre-Trained Perpendicular 2D Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08440)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we effectively leverage diffusion models to solve 3D image reconstruction problems in medical imaging? More specifically, the authors aim to develop a method that can fully exploit the 3D distributional prior of medical images to improve reconstruction quality, without relying too heavily on model-based priors like total variation that impose simplistic assumptions. To address this, they propose the Two Perpendicular 2D Diffusion Models (TPDM) approach, which models the 3D data distribution as a product of distributions from 2D diffusion models applied on perpendicular slice planes. This allows TPDM to capture global 3D dependencies more effectively compared to prior diffusion-based 3D reconstruction methods.The key hypothesis is that modeling the joint distribution using two perpendicular 2D diffusion models will enable high-quality 3D medical image reconstruction in applications like MRI super-resolution, compressed sensing MRI, and sparse view CT. The experiments aim to demonstrate the superiority of TPDM over existing state-of-the-art techniques empirically.In summary, the core research problem is developing an effective way to exploit diffusion model priors for 3D medical image reconstruction, with the proposed TPDM technique designed to capture 3D dependencies better than previous approaches. The hypothesis is that TPDM will achieve improved reconstruction quality in key medical imaging applications.
