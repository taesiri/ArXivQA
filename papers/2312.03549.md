## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Holmes, a framework optimized for training large language models (LLMs) across multiple GPU clusters with heterogeneous network interface cards (NICs). Holmes employs intelligent scheduling to allocate computational tasks to GPUs based on their NIC types, maximizing the capabilities of each network technology. Key innovations include cross-cluster pipeline parallelism to enable scaling across clusters without high-speed interconnects, self-adapting pipeline partitioning tailored to heterogeneous speeds, automatic NIC selection for data parallelism, and an overlapped distributed optimizer. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Holmes achieving performance in heterogeneous NIC environments close to that of homogeneous RDMA networks, and exceeding pure Ethernet environments. Comparisons to Megatron-LM, Megatron-DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LLaMA validate considerable improvements in training efficiency and scalability. The proposed scheduling and optimized parallelism in Holmes unlocks efficient heterogeneous system utilization for accessible and cost-effective LLM training.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 requires thousands of GPUs, often in specialized clusters with homogeneous high-speed RDMA networks. Acquiring such dedicated infrastructure is challenging. 
- Existing LLM training frameworks like Megatron-LM focus on optimizing training within homogeneous networks. They do not work well in heterogeneous NIC environments commonly found when using multiple clusters.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Holmes, a framework to train LLMs across clusters with heterogeneous NICs. 
- It uses intelligent scheduling to allocate computational tasklets to GPUs based on their NIC characteristics, aligning tasks to the strengths of each network technology.
- It introduces cross-cluster pipeline parallelism using Ethernet to connect clusters, reserving faster RDMA networks for data parallelism.
- It employs a self-adapting pipeline partition strategy to account for speed variations in the heterogeneous environment.

Main Contributions:
- Holmes achieves performance in heterogeneous networks comparable to that in homogeneous RDMA networks, and higher than pure Ethernet.
- It enables scalable LLM training across clusters without needing homogeneous high-speed interconnects between clusters.
- It is non-intrusive to existing infrastructure and maximizes utilization of available GPUs and networks.
- Extensive experiments validate its efficiency over mainstream LLM training frameworks in heterogeneous environments.

In summary, the paper presents Holmes, an LLM training framework designed specifically for heterogeneous network environments. By intelligently handling parallelism strategies, it unlocks the possibility of efficiently scaling LLM training to multiple clusters with diverse networking capabilities.
