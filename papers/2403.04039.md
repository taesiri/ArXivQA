# [Sample size planning for conditional counterfactual mean estimation with   a K-armed randomized experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of determining a sufficient sample size for a $K$-armed randomized experiment in order to estimate conditional counterfactual expectations (treatment effects) in data-driven subgroups. The goal is to estimate the counterfactual means $\mu^*(x,w)$ and treatment effects $\tau^*(x,w,w')$ as a function of features $x$, for $K$ treatment arms $w$. The subgroups are defined by partitioning the feature space $X$ into $L$ subsets using any machine learning model, such as a causal tree or policy tree. 

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to turn this goal into a simultaneous inference problem with $KL$ groups (one for each treatment arm and subset), where the sample size must be large enough to offset the increased possibility of errors. The paper provides results (Propositions 1-3) that give sufficient minimum sample sizes per group to ensure that with probability $1-\alpha$, the estimators $\hat{\mu}(x,w)$ and $\hat{\tau}(x,w,w')$ are within a margin of error $\epsilon$ of the true conditional means $\mu(x,w)$ and effects $\tau(x,w,w')$, either for a random test point $x$ or uniformly across $x$.

Key Contributions:
- Provides sample size formulas based on concentration inequalities that depend on the number of arms $K$, number of subsets $L$, confidence level $1-\alpha$, and margin of error $\epsilon$. 
- Allows flexibility in how the feature space $X$ is partitioned.
- Guarantees hold for estimating best arm $\max_w \mu(x,w)$ and treatment effects $\tau(x,w,w')$.
- Can determine maximum complexity $L,K$ given fixed sample budget. 
- Empirically evaluates coverage on semi-synthetic dataset.

Limitations: 
- External validity not addressed.
- Individual treatment effects difficult to estimate.
- Partitioning method contributes to informativeness.

In summary, the key insight is that by accounting for the simultaneous inference nature of the problem, the paper provides helpful sample size guidelines for complex nonlinear heterogeneous treatment effect estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies how to determine a sufficient sample size for a K-armed randomized experiment to estimate conditional counterfactual expectations in data-driven subgroups defined by partitioning the feature space, in order to attain nominal coverage guarantees.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is providing guidance on determining a sufficient sample size for estimating conditional counterfactual means in data-driven subgroups from a $K$-armed randomized experiment. Specifically, the paper:

1) Formulates the problem of estimating conditional counterfactual means in subgroups as a simultaneous inference problem, where the number of inferences depends on the number of treatment arms $K$ and the complexity of the subgroup model (e.g. number of leaves $L$ in a decision tree partition). 

2) Provides results (Propositions 1-3) that give sufficient sample size constraints to guarantee accurate inference of the conditional counterfactual means and best mean with high probability, based on different assumptions like bounded outcomes or a central limit theorem approximation.

3) Shows how the results can be inverted to determine feasible model complexity parameters like the number of treatment arms or subgroup partitions given a fixed sample size budget. 

4) Empirically evaluates the coverage guarantees on a large randomized experiment dataset using learned policy trees to partition the subgroups.

In summary, the paper gives useful guidance for sample size planning to ensure valid inference on conditional counterfactual means and treatment effects in data-driven subgroups from randomized experiments. The results help navigate the tradeoffs between number of treatment arms, model complexity for identifying subgroups, confidence level, and margin of error given sample size constraints.

The paper focuses on determining sufficient sample sizes for estimating conditional counterfactual means and treatment effects across subgroups defined by partitioning the feature space, such as with decision trees. Key concepts include honest prediction to enable valid inference, translating the goal into a simultaneous inference problem to account for multiple comparisons, and using concentration inequalities to derive sample size requirements. The empirical evaluation uses policy trees on an A/B test dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes determining the sample size needed to estimate conditional counterfactual expectations in data-driven subgroups. What are some of the key assumptions needed for this method to provide valid inferences? For example, what is assumed about the treatment assignment mechanism?

2. The paper aims to provide guarantees on estimating the conditional counterfactual means $\mu(x,w)$. What is the subtle difference between $\mu(x,w)$ and the actual population conditional counterfactual mean $\mu^*(x,w)$? What practical implication does this difference have?

3. Proposition 1 provides a sample size requirement based on the Central Limit Theorem. What are the key regularity conditions needed for the CLT to hold in this setting? Could you provide some practical insight into whether these conditions would hold in a real randomized experiment?  

4. How exactly does the method account for making multiple simultaneous inferences across the treatment arms and across the feature space subsets? What is the connection to multiple testing procedures?

5. The paper allows flexibility in how the partitioning of the feature space is done. What are some practical considerations in choosing a partitioning approach that would lead to more useful and externally valid inferences? 

6. Remark 1 discusses a standardized scale approach when variance bounds are unknown. What is the practical interpretation of the inference guarantees when working on a standardized scale? How could this still be useful forsample size planning?

7. Section 3.3 discusses strategies for obtaining bounds on the conditional outcome variance. What are some practical challenges in obtaining tight variance bounds? When might the conservative bound not be conservative enough?

8. Given a fixed sample size budget, the paper shows how to determine the maximum allowable number of treatment arms or feature space subsets. What are some subtle issues when trying to maximize model complexity given sample size constraints?

9. The empirical evaluation uses a semi-synthetic simulation approach. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this compared to a complete simulated data study? How does the semi-synthetic approach approximate "truth" to evaluate the method?

10. The paper focuses on sample size planning for internal validity. What are some important practical considerations regarding external validity and transportability that are not addressed in the paper? How might the method be extended to account for these issues?
