# [FaaF: Facts as a Function for the evaluation of RAG systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03888)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Factual recall (i.e. verifying that all necessary facts from a reference text are contained in a generated response) is important for evaluating retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, but remains challenging to perform reliably and efficiently. 
- Existing prompt-based fact verification methods using language models (LMs) are unreliable when dealing with incomplete or inaccurate text.

Proposed Solution - Facts as a Function (FaaF):
- Represents facts as fields in a callable function object instead of a prompt. Allows verifying multiple facts in a single LM call.  
- Converts LM responses into a standardized format (True/False) using a parsing function. Outsources some judgment from the LM.
- Tested on augmented WikiEval dataset with human annotations of fact validity across answer variants of differing quality.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates problems with prompt-based verification, with >50% error rate on texts lacking information.
- FaaF reduces errors substantially (>40 percentage points), improves efficiency (5x fewer LM calls).
- Additional FaaF configurations (adding "not clear" option, asking for citations) further improve performance.  
- Provides an end-to-end framework and method for automatic factual recall evaluation of RAG systems.
- Open sources FaaF software package and augmented WikiEval dataset.

In summary, the key innovation is representing facts as callable functions rather than prompts, which enables more reliable and efficient fact verification, especially on incomplete/inaccurate texts. This facilitates improved factual recall evaluation for RAG systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces Facts as a Function (FaaF), a new approach for efficient and reliable fact verification in texts using language models, outperforming prompting formulations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of Facts as a Function (FaaF), a new fact verification formulation using function calling abilities of language models, which substantially improves the ability to identify unsupported facts compared to prompt-based approaches. 

2) An end-to-end factual recall evaluation framework tailored for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which can be used to create test datasets and perform automated factual recall evaluation.

3) Analysis showing that prompt-based fact verification struggles with incomplete or inaccurate text, while FaaF significantly reduces error rates in those cases.

4) Efficiency improvements from encapsulating multiple facts into a single function call, reducing the number of queries to the language model evaluator by over 5 times compared to prompting each fact individually.

5) Release of the augmented WikiEval dataset with human annotations of fact validity across answer variants, as well as open sourcing the evaluation framework with FaaF as a Python package to help the community advance factual recall evaluation for RAG systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Facts as a Function (FaaF) - The main method proposed in the paper for fact verification using language models. It involves representing facts as fields in a callable function object.

- Fact verification - Evaluating the truthfulness of factual statements. A key application area explored in the paper.

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - RAG systems incorporate external knowledge into language model outputs. Factual recall is an important evaluation metric for these systems. 

- Prompting - Using natural language prompts to query language models. Compared against FaaF in the paper.

- Factual recall - Evaluating whether a text contains all necessary facts to answer a question. Important for RAG systems.

- WikiEval dataset - Used in the paper to compare fact verification formulations. Features question/answer pairs of varying quality.

- Language models (LMs) - Models like GPT-3 used for generative tasks. Evaluator LMs (LMevals) used for fact verification in the paper.

- Error rate - Key evaluation metric used to compare performance of different fact verification approaches. 

- Efficiency - Function calls require fewer LM queries and tokens than prompting. Improves efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Facts as a Function (FaaF) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using function calling to enforce "a more formal mode of reasoning and communication" compared to natural language prompting. Can you expand more on why this is the case and the specific benefits of using a function call interface? 

2. One of the key ideas of FaaF is processing a set of facts as a unit via a function object rather than verifying each fact individually. What are some of the computational and efficiency advantages of this approach? How does it aid the language model's assessment?

3. The paper finds that language models tend to overestimate fact truthfulness overall. Why do you think this occurs, even when factual information is clearly presented? How can framing facts as callable functions help mitigate this issue?

4. What are some potential ways the instructions and metadata passed in the FaaF function object can be optimized to improve performance? What are some promising directions for future research here? 

5. The paper shows that generating citations before fact verification is sensitive to the quality/coverage of information in the text. Can you elaborate why performance depends greatly on the text content? How can FaaF be enhanced to leverage citations more robustly?

6. One experiment shows that false positives are more likely when inaccurate/tangential information is present versus missing information. Why do you think irrelevant details trip up language models more than absence of details? 

7. Beyond computational efficiency, what are some other potential benefits of encapsulating multiple facts into a single callable function object? How does this align better with real-world use cases?

8. The paper establishes the value of FaaF for evaluating factual recall in retrieval-augmented generation systems. What are other potential use cases where FaaF could provide advantages over standard prompting? 

9. What kinds of additional logic processing and post-processing on language model outputs are enabled by using a function call interface instead of free text? What opportunities does this create?

10. What are some promising directions for future work in developing the FaaF paradigm? What experiments would you propose to build on the method and ideas presented in this paper?
