# [FaaF: Facts as a Function for the evaluation of RAG systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03888)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Factual recall (i.e. verifying that all necessary facts from a reference text are contained in a generated response) is important for evaluating retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, but remains challenging to perform reliably and efficiently. 
- Existing prompt-based fact verification methods using language models (LMs) are unreliable when dealing with incomplete or inaccurate text.

Proposed Solution - Facts as a Function (FaaF):
- Represents facts as fields in a callable function object instead of a prompt. Allows verifying multiple facts in a single LM call.  
- Converts LM responses into a standardized format (True/False) using a parsing function. Outsources some judgment from the LM.
- Tested on augmented WikiEval dataset with human annotations of fact validity across answer variants of differing quality.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates problems with prompt-based verification, with >50% error rate on texts lacking information.
- FaaF reduces errors substantially (>40 percentage points), improves efficiency (5x fewer LM calls).
- Additional FaaF configurations (adding "not clear" option, asking for citations) further improve performance.  
- Provides an end-to-end framework and method for automatic factual recall evaluation of RAG systems.
- Open sources FaaF software package and augmented WikiEval dataset.

In summary, the key innovation is representing facts as callable functions rather than prompts, which enables more reliable and efficient fact verification, especially on incomplete/inaccurate texts. This facilitates improved factual recall evaluation for RAG systems.
