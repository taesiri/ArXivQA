# [Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative language models (LMs) are being widely used, but explaining their predictions is challenging. 
- Existing methods like LIME and SHAP focus on explaining text classification models, not generative LMs.
- Text generation poses two key challenges: (1) text as output instead of numbers, (2) long text inputs.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a framework called MExGen (Multi-level Explanations for Generative LMs) to address these challenges.

- For text outputs, it introduces "scalarizers" to map text to real numbers to quantify sensitivity. Several scalarizers are explored including similarity measures and using auxiliary models, allowing a black-box setting.

- For long inputs, it uses linguistic segmentation and proceeds explanation from coarse to fine granularity. Algorithms with linear complexity in input units are used like L-SHAP and a constrained LIME variant.

Main Contributions:
- Propose general MExGen framework to extend perturbation-based attribution to generative LMs
- Investigate different scalarizers for handling text outputs, including for black-box setting
- Use multi-level strategy combining linguistic segmentation and refinement to address long inputs
- Systematic evaluation on summarization and QA showing MExGen provides more locally faithful explanations than available alternatives

The paper also includes a user study assessing perceived fidelity and preference of the methods. Key results validated that the proposed approach can help better explain outputs of generative LMs.
