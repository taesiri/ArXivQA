# [GFLean: An Autoformalisation Framework for Lean via GF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents an autoformalisation framework called GFLean that can translate simple mathematical statements from a controlled natural language called Simplified ForTheL to Lean theorem prover expressions. Autoformalisation refers to the process of automatically converting textual statements to formal logical expressions that can be processed by a computer. 

The key components of GFLean are:

1) A parser implemented in Grammatical Framework (GF) that takes as input statements in Simplified ForTheL and produces abstract syntax trees. Simplified ForTheL is based on the ForTheL language but has reduced expressiveness.

2) Haskell functions that simplify the abstract syntax trees and then translate them to Lean theorem prover expressions, preserving the meaning.

3) A Lean grammar also implemented in GF that can linearize the translated abstract syntax trees into valid Lean expressions.

The translation pipeline thus has four main steps - parsing, simplification, translation and linearization. GF is used for parsing and linearization while Haskell handles simplification and translation of abstract syntax trees.

GFLean was tested on mathematical statements from a standard textbook. Out of 62 statements, 42 could be translated after minor rephrasing of the natural language with the current limited lexicon. This demonstrates GFLean can handle a fragment of the language of mathematics involving quantifiers, logical operations and predicate modifiers.

The main limitations highlighted are - limited coverage of linguistic constructions in Simplified ForTheL compared to full mathematical language, inability to expand lexicon dynamically from within the system, and lack of communication with the Lean system for utilizing existing definitions.

Potential future work includes extending the input language constructs, expanding the lexicon, tighter integration with Lean by reimplementing GFLean inside Lean, and combining statistical and rule-based methods for building robust autoformalisation systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents GFLean, an autoformalization framework that uses Grammatical Framework (GF) and Haskell to parse simplified natural language mathematical statements and convert them to Lean theorem prover expressions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Implementing algorithms in Haskell to translate Simplified ForTheL expressions to Lean expressions by manipulating abstract syntax trees (ASTs). 

2. Implementing a grammar for Lean expressions in Grammatical Framework (GF), so that the ASTs obtained from the translation can be linearized as Lean expressions.

3. Building a working autoformalization framework called GFLean that uses GF for parsing and linearization of input and output, with Haskell code to perform AST transformations in between. 

4. Demonstrating GFLean's capabilities by using it to formalize 42 out of 62 statements from a textbook, with only minor rephrasing of the input required.

5. Discussing limitations of GFLean, including its limited lexicon and linguistic constructs, as well as lack of dynamicity to add new definitions on the fly.

6. Proposing ideas for future improvements to GFLean, such as reimplementing it in Lean for better dynamicity, and using rule-based and neural translation systems together for more robust autoformalization.

In summary, the main contribution is the development of a prototype autoformalization framework GFLean using GF and Haskell, along with an analysis of its capabilities and limitations to inform future work in this direction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Autoformalisation - The process of automatically converting text from a natural language to a formal language. A main focus of the paper.

- Grammatical Framework (GF) - A high-level grammar writing tool used in the GFLean framework to parse input text and linearize output expressions.

- Simplified ForTheL - A simplified version of the ForTheL controlled natural language that is used as the input language for GFLean. 

- Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) - Tree representations of the syntactic structure of expressions. GFLean manipulates ASTs during the translation process.

- Lean theorem prover - The target formal language that natural language statements are translated to in GFLean.

- Translation pipeline - The series of steps in GFLean to convert input text to output Lean expressions, involving parsing, simplification, AST transformation, and linearization.

- Lexicon - The vocabulary and words that are recognized by the Simplified ForTheL grammar. Expanding the lexicon allows handling more input statements.

- Dynamicity - The ability for users to expand the grammar by adding new definitions. Lacking in GFLean but could be achieved by reimplementing it in Lean itself.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the GFLean autoformalization framework proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that GFLean uses Grammatical Framework (GF) for parsing and linearization of input text. Can you explain more about how GF works and why it was chosen for this task instead of other natural language processing techniques?

2. GFLean converts simplified ForTheL expressions to Lean theorem prover expressions. What are some key differences between ForTheL and the simplified ForTheL syntax used in GFLean? Why was a simplified version used?

3. The paper outlines a 4-step pipeline for translating natural language statements to Lean expressions. Can you walk through this pipeline step-by-step for a sample input statement? How do the steps work together?

4. GFLean performs AST simplification before translation to Lean. What specific simplifications are done in this step? Why are they necessary for correct translation? 

5. What is the approach used in GFLean to translate quantified expressions like "every x" or "no y" from simplified ForTheL to Lean? How is the meaning preserved in these cases?

6. The limitations section mentions that GFLean lacks support for linguistic phenomena like conjunction of predicates and post-fix quantification. Can you provide some examples of statements having these phenomena and explain challenges they pose?

7. Dynamicity and extensibility of the lexicon are mentioned as desired features. How can GFLean's implementation be extended to support this? What changes would be required?

8. The paper suggests reimplementing GFLean in Lean itself to attain dynamicity. What advantages would this provide over the current Haskell implementation? What challenges do you foresee?

9. How can neural translation methods and rule-based methods like GFLean complement each other for building robust autoformalization pipelines? Can you suggest a hybrid architecture?

10. GFLean focuses only on statement formalization right now. How can the approach be extended to also formalize proofs accompanying the statements? What additional syntactic and semantic complexities need to be handled?
