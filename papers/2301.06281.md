# [DPE: Disentanglement of Pose and Expression for General Video Portrait   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06281)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the key research focus of this paper is developing a method for decoupling facial pose and expression in video-driven talking face generation, in order to enable independent control over pose and expression for general video portrait editing applications. 

Specifically, the authors highlight that in existing one-shot talking face generation methods, head pose and facial expression are entangled and transferred simultaneously from the driving video to the source portrait image. However, for video portrait editing applications, it is desirable to modify only the expression while maintaining the original pose. 

The main challenge is the lack of paired data with the same pose but different expressions, which is needed for explicitly disentangling pose and expression. Prior work using 3D morphable face models for disentanglement has limitations in accuracy and facial detail.

To address this, the key contribution of this paper is a new self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression without paired data or 3D morphable models. The technical approach involves:

- A motion editing module to disentangle pose and expression representations in latent space.

- Separate pose and expression generators to interpret the disentangled representations.

- A bidirectional cyclic training strategy with designed constraints to enable self-supervised disentanglement learning without paired data.

Through experiments, the authors demonstrate their method's ability to control pose and expression independently and show results for general video portrait editing.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that with the proposed disentanglement framework and training strategy, the model can learn to decouple facial pose and expression in a self-supervised manner, enabling independent control over pose and expression for video editing applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression for independent motion transfer, without using 3DMMs or paired data.

2. Developing a bidirectional cyclic training strategy with constraints to achieve disentanglement of pose and expression.

3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed method can control pose and expression independently, and can be applied to general video editing tasks. 

In summary, the key contribution seems to be the novel disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression in a self-supervised manner, which enables independent control over pose and expression for applications like video portrait editing. The proposed training strategy and constraints enable this disentanglement without reliance on 3DMMs or paired data. Experiments validate the ability to edit pose and expression independently and the applicability to general video editing tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression for independent motion transfer in video-driven talking face generation, without requiring 3D morphable models or paired data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other related work on video-driven talking face generation:

- Most prior work has focused on one-shot talking face generation, where head pose and facial expression are transferred together from a driving video to a source portrait image. However, this entanglement makes it difficult to apply one-shot methods directly to video portrait editing tasks, which may require modifying only expression while keeping pose fixed. 

- This paper proposes a method to disentangle and control pose and expression independently, enabling applications to general video editing. Very few prior works have tackled this pose/expression disentanglement - most are based on 3D morphable models (3DMMs) which have limited facial detail. 

- Unlike 3DMM-based methods, this paper presents a self-supervised framework to decouple pose and expression without relying on 3DMMs or paired training data. The key is a bidirectional cyclic training strategy and well-designed reconstruction constraints.

- The proposed modular framework consists of a motion editing module, expression generator, and pose generator. Motion transfer is performed via simple latent code addition rather than 3DMM parameter manipulation.

- Experiments demonstrate the ability to control pose and expression independently. The method achieves better performance on expression editing compared to recent 3DMM-based state-of-the-art methods. Video results also showcase successful application to video portrait editing.

- While focused on disentanglement for editing, the model also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art on standard one-shot talking face generation when generators are used jointly.

In summary, the key novelty is the self-supervised framework for implicit pose/expression disentanglement without 3DMMs, unlocking general video editing applications that most prior single-image based methods cannot handle. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate strong capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the disentanglement of pose and expression in the latent space. The authors mention that their self-supervised framework could potentially be improved to achieve better disentanglement, leading to more independent control over pose and expression.

- Extending the method to video-to-video synthesis. The current method transfers facial motions from an image to a video, but the authors suggest exploring transferring motions between videos directly. This could allow for more complex video editing applications.

- Exploring other representations beyond 3DMM and latent spaces. The authors mainly compare against 3DMM-based methods. They suggest investigating other representations like landmarks or graph convolutions to represent facial attributes.

- Applying the disentanglement framework to other tasks. The disentanglement approach could potentially be useful for other face synthesis tasks beyond talking faces like facial animation, avatar creation, etc. Exploring these applications is suggested.

- Improving identity preservation, especially for large pose differences. The identity preservation degrades when the pose difference between source and driving faces is very large. Improving identity preservation in these cases is noted as an important direction.

- Accelerating the training and inference. The current approach involves multiple stages of training and inference steps. Speeding up the overall pipeline could make the approach more practical.

In summary, the main suggested directions are around improving the core disentanglement framework, extending to new applications and representations, and improving identity preservation and efficiency. The disentanglement concept shows promise but still needs refinement to reach its full potential.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression for video-driven talking face generation, without using 3D morphable models or paired data. The framework consists of a motion editing module, a pose generator, and an expression generator. The editing module projects faces into a latent space where pose and expression motion can be disentangled, allowing independent transfer via simple vector addition. To accomplish disentanglement without paired data, a bidirectional cyclic training strategy with reconstruction and intermediate result consistency constraints is proposed. Evaluations demonstrate the ability to control pose and expression independently, enabling applications in general video portrait editing by modifying expression while maintaining unchanged pose to handle paste-back. The method achieves better facial detail and identity preservation compared to recent state-of-the-art 3DMM-based disentanglement techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression for talking face generation, breaking through the limitation of paired data without using 3DMMs. The framework consists of a motion editing module, a pose generator, and an expression generator. The editing module projects faces into a latent space where pose and expression motion can be disentangled. Pose or expression transfer is performed by adding the latent code of a source face with the disentangled pose or expression motion code of a driving face. The two generators then render the modified latent codes to images. To accomplish disentanglement without paired data, a bidirectional cyclic training strategy with well-designed constraints is proposed. Given a source and driving face, expression and pose are transferred from the driving to source face sequentially, resulting in two synthetic faces. By exchanging the roles of source and driving, pose and expression are transferred back, creating two more synthetic faces. Several losses are computed between these faces to supervise disentanglement. Evaluations demonstrate this method can control pose and expression independently, and be used for general video editing.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework to disentangle pose and expression for talking face generation without requiring paired data or 3DMMs. A bidirectional cyclic training strategy with carefully designed losses enables pose and expression to be controlled independently. This allows the method to be applied to general video portrait editing tasks. Evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed disentanglement framework.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is a novel self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression for video portrait editing. The framework consists of three components: a motion editing module, a pose generator, and an expression generator. The editing module maps faces into a latent space where pose and expression can be disentangled, allowing independent pose and expression transfer via simple vector arithmetic. To achieve disentanglement without paired data, a bidirectional cyclic training strategy is proposed with constraints based on reconstructing the input faces. This allows pose and expression to be controlled independently without relying on less accurate 3D morphable models. Through both disentanglement and one-shot generalization, the method enables realistic video portrait editing by transferring the facial motions from an arbitrary driving video to the portrait video of an unseen person.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper is addressing the problem of disentangling head pose and facial expression in video-driven talking face generation systems. 

Specifically, it notes that most existing one-shot talking face generation methods transfer head pose and facial expression simultaneously from a driving video to a source portrait image. However, this entanglement prevents these methods from being directly applied to video portrait editing tasks, where you may want to modify the expression independently while keeping the pose unchanged. 

The key challenge is the lack of paired data with the same pose but different expressions, or vice versa, which is needed for disentanglement. Existing methods rely on 3D morphable models (3DMMs) for explicit disentanglement, but 3DMMs lack accuracy for capturing facial details. 

To address this, the paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning framework to disentangle pose and expression without needing 3DMMs or paired data. The key ideas are:

- A motion editing module to project faces into a latent space where pose and expression can be disentangled. Motion transfer is performed via simple addition in this space.

- Two generators to render the modified latent codes into images - one for pose and one for expression.

- A bidirectional cyclic training strategy with designed constraints to achieve disentanglement without paired data.

The proposed method is evaluated on video portrait editing and one-shot talking face generation tasks. Results demonstrate it can control pose and expression independently and achieves state-of-the-art performance on disentanglement and editing tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces a way to disentangle pose and expression in one-shot talking face systems to enable general video portrait editing, without relying on less accurate 3DMMs or paired data.
