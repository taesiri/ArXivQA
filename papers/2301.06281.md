# [DPE: Disentanglement of Pose and Expression for General Video Portrait   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06281)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the key research focus of this paper is developing a method for decoupling facial pose and expression in video-driven talking face generation, in order to enable independent control over pose and expression for general video portrait editing applications. Specifically, the authors highlight that in existing one-shot talking face generation methods, head pose and facial expression are entangled and transferred simultaneously from the driving video to the source portrait image. However, for video portrait editing applications, it is desirable to modify only the expression while maintaining the original pose. The main challenge is the lack of paired data with the same pose but different expressions, which is needed for explicitly disentangling pose and expression. Prior work using 3D morphable face models for disentanglement has limitations in accuracy and facial detail.To address this, the key contribution of this paper is a new self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression without paired data or 3D morphable models. The technical approach involves:- A motion editing module to disentangle pose and expression representations in latent space.- Separate pose and expression generators to interpret the disentangled representations.- A bidirectional cyclic training strategy with designed constraints to enable self-supervised disentanglement learning without paired data.Through experiments, the authors demonstrate their method's ability to control pose and expression independently and show results for general video portrait editing.In summary, the core hypothesis is that with the proposed disentanglement framework and training strategy, the model can learn to decouple facial pose and expression in a self-supervised manner, enabling independent control over pose and expression for video editing applications.
