# [Teaching Structured Vision&amp;Language Concepts to Vision&amp;Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11733)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve vision-language (VL) models' understanding of structured vision & language concepts (SVLCs) like object attributes, relations, and states, without sacrificing their impressive zero-shot object recognition capabilities. The key hypothesis is that by leveraging language modeling and structure, they can manipulate the text part of standard VL paired datasets to teach models these SVLCs more effectively, through techniques like:- Generating rule-based or LLM-based negative examples that change only a word to alter SVLC meaning.- Using LLMs to generate semantically similar but differently worded positive examples. - Adding losses that explicitly focus the model on differentiating these generated examples.The paper shows these techniques can significantly enhance SVLC understanding in both fine-tuning and training from scratch settings, while largely maintaining zero-shot performance. The core idea is harnessing language structure to teach it to VL models in a data-driven way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a data-driven technique to improve vision-language (VL) models' understanding of structured vision and language concepts (SVLC) like object attributes, relations, and states. The key ideas are:1. Leveraging language structure and NLP/LLMs to manipulate the textual part of standard VL dataset pairs. This generates additional text versions like negatives and analogies to teach SVLCs. 2. Using separate loss functions like the negatives and analogy losses to explicitly focus the VL model training on SVLC aspects in the enhanced data.3. Experiments showing significant gains of up to 15% in SVLC understanding on benchmarks while largely preserving zero-shot capabilities. This is demonstrated for both finetuning and training from scratch settings.4. An efficient VL model finetuning technique adapted from LoRA that adds low-rank adapters throughout the model. This reduces catastrophic forgetting of zero-shot skills during SVLC-targeted finetuning.In summary, the paper presents an elegant data-driven approach to improve VL models' structured language understanding by better harnessing standard VL datasets through textual manipulation. The gains are shown across models like CLIP and CyCLIP while maintaining zero-shot performance.
