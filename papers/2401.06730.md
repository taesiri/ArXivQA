# [Relying on the Unreliable: The Impact of Language Models' Reluctance to   Express Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- As natural language interfaces become more prevalent for human-AI interaction, there is a critical need for language models (LMs) to appropriately communicate uncertainties to support reliable collaborations. 

- However, analysis of deployed LMs shows that they rarely express uncertainties, and when explicitly prompted, they exhibit a bias towards overconfidence, even when generating incorrect responses.

- This overconfidence can lead to harms such as exacerbating human over-reliance on AI systems. 

Methods:
- The authors systematically prompt several LMs (GPT, LLaMA, Claude) to elicit epistemic markers signaling model confidence. They find LMs reluctant to express uncertainty and biased towards using strengtheners ("I am certain...") even for wrong answers.

- Through user studies, they show humans heavily rely on LM-generated expressions of high confidence and even plain responses lacking markers. Minor LM miscalibrations negatively impact long-term human performance.

- They trace the origins of overconfidence to human preference datasets used in LM training, uncovering annotation biases penalizing texts with uncertainty.

Contributions:  
- Comprehensive analysis demonstrating LMs' reluctance and inability to properly express confidences and uncertainties.

- Revelations of risks and harms of LM overconfidence on downstream human reliance and performance. 

- Identification of roots of overconfidence in human annotation biases against uncertainty.

- Design recommendations to improve linguistic calibration, such as generating default weakeners and using plain statements only for high confidence.

The work exposes critical shortcomings in LM communication of uncertainties, outlines associated human harms, and provides solutions towards safer and more reliable human-AI collaboration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates how language models use epistemic markers to express uncertainty, finds that models are overconfident and users over-rely on confident statements, and traces the overconfidence to biases in human feedback used to train the models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1) An analysis of how language models use epistemic markers (expressions of uncertainty or certainty) when generating responses to questions. The authors find that models struggle to appropriately incorporate epistemic markers, often expressing too much certainty even when responses are incorrect.

2) Human experiments evaluating how people interpret and rely on epistemic markers generated by language models. The results indicate that people heavily rely on confident statements from models, even minor miscalibrations can negatively impact reliance long-term.  

3) Tracing the origins of language model overconfidence in epistemic markers to the reinforcement learning from human feedback process. The authors find human annotators show a bias against uncertainty when providing preferences.

Together, these findings expose issues with language model calibration in using natural language to convey uncertainty, outline potential downstream harms for users, and provide recommendations for improving calibration going forward. The key overall contribution seems to be demonstrating risks surrounding the communication of uncertainty between language models and people.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Epistemic markers - Expressions that convey a speaker's stance and commitment, such as hedges, boosters, evidentials, etc. These serve to communicate uncertainty or confidence.

- Strengtheners - A type of epistemic marker that expresses certainty, such as "I am confident..."

- Weakeners - A type of epistemic marker that expresses uncertainty, such as "I am not sure..."

- Linguistic calibration - The alignment between a language model's accuracy and its articulated epistemic markers. 

- Overconfidence - When language models express higher confidence than their actual accuracy warrants.

- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - A training approach that uses human preferences over model outputs to optimize models.

- Mental models - How users develop an understanding of how an AI system works over repeated interactions.

- Algorithmic aversion - When users lose trust in an algorithm, even after it becomes more accurate, due to early negative experiences.

- Cognitive forcing functions - Design elements intended to discourage over-reliance on AI systems by highlighting their limitations.

So in summary, the paper examines epistemic markers in language models, model overconfidence issues, human interpretation of uncertainties, and the origins of overconfidence in RLHF training. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors use a "bottom-up" approach to eliciting epistemic markers from language models rather than providing a predefined set. What are the trade-offs of this approach compared to providing a fixed set of verbal uncertainty expressions? Could this approach miss certain types of epistemic markers?

2. The paper finds that language models struggle to produce epistemic markers without explicit prompting. What modifications could be made to the pretraining or finetuning procedures of LMs to make them more likely to volunteer uncertainty without being explicitly asked?

3. The authors use 49 different prompts to elicit uncertainty from LMs. How sensitive are the results to the exact wording and framing of these prompts? Could changing small details substantially impact the rates of strengtheners/weakeners? 

4. What are some of the challenges in automatically identifying phrase-level epistemic markers compared to single words? What type of model would you propose for accurately classifying generated epistemic markers?

5. The paper finds differences in epistemic marker usage between model families (GPT vs LLaMA vs Claude) as well as model sizes. What factors contribute most to these differences? How could we better understand and explain them?

6. The human experiments simulate interactions with an "AI agent" named Marvin. How sensitive are the results to anthropomorphism/framing of AI system? Would a different metaphorical framing change reliance?  

7. The paper focuses exclusively on the domain of trivia questions. Would the overreliance results hold in high stakes domains like finance or healthcare? When would higher caution be warranted?

8. The authors find origins of overconfidence in RLHF reward modeling's dispreference for uncertainty. But reward modeling is a complex pipeline. What other factors could contribute to overconfidence?

9. The authors connect epistemic markers to concepts like linguistic calibration, pragmatic harms, and cognitive forcing functions. What other bodies of literature could enrich the understanding of uncertainties in LM generated text?

10. If reluctance to generate uncertainty is an inherent model tendency, what type of uncertainty expressions should be prioritized to mitigate potential harms? Which have the highest utility for safe and reliable collaboration?
