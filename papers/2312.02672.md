# [Are Synthetic Data Useful for Egocentric Hand-Object Interaction   Detection? An Investigation and the HOI-Synth Domain Adaptation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02672)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates whether generating large-scale synthetic data can reduce the need for labeled real-world data in training models for egocentric hand-object interaction detection. The authors develop a simulator based on Unity to automatically generate diverse synthetic images mimicking real hand-object interactions, with automatic labeling of elements like hands, objects, segmentation masks, contact states, etc. They introduce the HOI-Synth benchmark combining real datasets (VISOR, Ego-HOS, ENIGMA-51) and synthetic data for studying domain adaptation in this area. Through experiments with domain adaptation methods on HOI-Synth, they demonstrate that models trained on synthetic data plus little labeled real data can match or exceed the performance of models trained on much more labeled real data alone. With only 25% of VISOR's real training data, their semi-supervised approach achieves comparable overall hand+object mAP to the fully supervised baseline. The use of in-domain synthetic data tailored to the real test environments further improves performance. The results highlight the potential of synthetic data generation to reduce manual labeling needs for egocentric hand-object interaction understanding.
