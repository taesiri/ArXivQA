# [Distillation Contrastive Decoding: Improving LLMs Reasoning with   Contrastive Decoding and Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Contrastive Decoding (CD) is an effective method for enhancing reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but has two main limitations: 
1) It requires an "amateur" model from the same model family in addition to the "expert" model, increasing computational demands. 
2) Appropriate smaller amateur models are not always available.

Proposed Solution - Distillation Contrastive Decoding (DCD):
- Combines ideas from Contrastive Decoding (CD) and Contrastive Chain-of-thought Prompting (CP).  
- Uses distillation techniques like dropout and quantization to simulate a weaker "amateur" model instead of requiring a separate smaller model.
- Employs valid chain-of-thought examples for expert model and invalid examples for distilled amateur model. 

Main Contributions:
- Introduces DCD to enhance LLM reasoning without needing extra smaller models, reducing memory usage.  
- Shows DCD outperforms CD by 1.89% on GSM8K and 3.53% on StrategyQA using Llama2 models.
- Demonstrates high adaptability of DCD to stronger models by improved GSM8K accuracy of +6.8% on Mistral-7B.
- Finds optimal amateur information comes from moderate dropout rates, not very low capacity models.
- Establishes correlation between base model knowledge and DCD improvement.

In summary, the paper proposes Distillation Contrastive Decoding to overcome limitations of Contrastive Decoding by eliminating the need for separate amateur models and reducing memory requirements, while improving reasoning performance across multiple benchmark tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Distillation Contrastive Decoding (DCD) method proposed in the paper:

1. How does DCD build upon and extend the ideas from Contrastive Decoding (CD) and Contrastive Chain-of-thought Prompting (CP)? What are the key innovations?

2. The paper claims DCD overcomes the limitation of CD's reliance on smaller "amateur" models. How does the distillation process in DCD achieve this? What are the technical details? 

3. The dropout rate gamma is identified as an important hyperparameter. What experiments were done to determine the optimal values for gamma? What range of values work best?

4. What is the intuition behind using invalid chain-of-thought examples in the distilled amateur model? How does this provide useful signal?

5. Quantitative results show DCD helps Llama2 models significantly. What specifically about Llama2 makes the improvements more pronounced compared to other models?

6. How does the performance improvement of DCD correlate with the base knowledge and capabilities of the model itself? What does this suggest about the method?

7. What experiments were done with different distillation methods like quantization? How do they compare to dropout distillation?

8. The paper hypothesizes DCD could bring widespread improvements to much stronger models. What evidence supports this claim? What models would be interesting to try?

9. What types of contrastive chain-of-thought demonstrations were explored? What insights were gained about the prompt engineering process?

10. Limitations are discussed, but what other potential issues need to be studied regarding scaling DCD to more complex reasoning tasks?
