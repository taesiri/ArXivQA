# [Ontologically Faithful Generation of Non-Player Character Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10618)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How can we automatically generate high-quality, coherent dialogue trees for non-player characters (NPCs) in video games that accurately reflect underlying quest objectives and game lore?The key points are:- The paper introduces a new dataset called Knudge that contains professionally authored NPC dialogue trees paired with granular quest and entity annotations derived from the RPG game The Outer Worlds. - The authors frame the core research problem as knowledge-constrained NPC dialogue generation - given quest objectives, entity biographies, dialogue history etc., can models generate dialogue trees that are realistic, coherent, and faithfully reflect the input knowledge?- The paper proposes and evaluates neural generation models termed DialogueWriters that leverage large language models like GPT-3 in a zero-shot or few-shot setting to generate utterances conditioned on the input knowledge.- Experiments reveal competent performance but significant room for improvement, especially in jointly reasoning over the complex input specifications.In summary, the core research question is around developing models that can automatically generate high-quality NPC dialogue trees grounded in complex game quest and lore specifications, with Knudge introduced as a platform to facilitate progress.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introduction of a new dataset called KNUDGE (Knowledge Constrained User-NPC Dialogue GEneration) containing dialogue trees extracted from the video game The Outer Worlds.

Formulation of the challenging task of knowledge-constrained NPC dialogue generation, where the goal is to generate coherent dialogue trees that accurately reflect the provided quest and biography specifications.3. Introduction of DialogueWriter models that leverage large neural language models like GPT-3 to generate utterance candidates conditioned on the quest/biography constraints and dialogue context. Experiments are conducted with different model variations, like knowledge selection mechanisms, to encourage faithfulness to the constraints.4. Evaluation protocols prescribed for testing models on their abilities to reflect the ontological constraints in addition to generating fluent dialogues. Experiments conducted on in-context utterance generation as well as end-to-end dialogue tree generation.5. Analysis showing competent performance by neural models on the task, but significant room for future improvement on aspects like jointly reasoning over facts, covering all quest objectives, and achieving human-level coherence and narrative quality.In summary, the paper introduces a new challenging grounded dialogue generation task along with dataset, models, and evaluations to drive progress in this direction. The dataset and task are designed to facilitate research towards AI tools that can assist game developers in efficiently authoring high-quality NPC dialogues.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related research:- The paper introduces a new dataset, KNUDGE, which contains real dialogues and knowledge constraints from the video game The Outer Worlds. This is unique compared to other dialogue datasets like LIGHT, which use crowdworkers or simulate simple RPG dialogues. KNUDGE contains professionally authored complex dialogue trees grounded in detailed game quests and lore.- The paper proposes the challenging task of knowledge-constrained NPC dialogue generation, requiring models to produce branching dialogue trees that cover specified quest objectives and reflect provided entity biographies. This is more complex than prior persona-based dialogue tasks.- The DialogueWriter models introduced leverage modern techniques like T5 and GPT-3 instead of specialized dialogue models. The prompt engineering to incorporate game constraints is novel compared to how such models are typically applied.- The paper prescribes detailed automatic and human evaluation protocols tailored to game dialogue generation, assessing quest/lore faithfulness, coherence, coverage of objectives, etc. This goes beyond prior automatic metrics like BLEU.- Results reveal competent but imperfect performance compared to human writing. The paper analyzes remaining challenges like joint reasoning over facts, persona embodiment, and coverage of all objectives. It identifies areas for improvement over strong baseline models.- The introduced task and dataset move the field closer to usable tools for game writing assistance, compared to previous work focused on simplified tasks. The analysis sets up challenges for future work to make further progress on this difficult application area.In summary, the paper makes contributions in terms of a unique game dialogue dataset, novel task formulation, baseline models adapted to this genre, and evaluation protocols designed for this application. It represents an advance in grounded dialogue research towards complex real-world narratives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing methods that can better model the complex branching tree structures of dialogues, rather than just linearizing nodes. They suggest exploring graph encoder methods as a potential approach.- Improving persona embodiment in generated dialogues to make utterances more dynamically reflect appropriate emotions and situations like human-quality utterances do.- Generating dialogues for major NPCs that have long biographies and important roles, such as companion characters, as the current work focused more on side quest NPCs.- Evaluating whether end-to-end generated dialogues fully cover all the quest requirements specified in the input, rather than just portions of them.- Developing co-pilot tools that can help with authoring the high-level quest specifications and ontology facts that serve as input to the dialogue generation models.- Mitigating potential biases in pre-trained language models like GPT-3 that could lead to generating offensive content, through techniques like human moderation.- Evaluating the models on fully new quests without any overlap in entities, to better measure few-shot generalization.- Moving beyond extracting ontology facts from fan wikis to using official game channel data.Overall, the main future directions focus on improving faithfulness to complex NPC persona and quest narratives, scaling to more elaborate dialogues, and developing more complete assistive tools for game writers. Evaluation on new games and data is also emphasized to better measure generalization.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset and task called KNUDGE (Knowledge Constrained User-NPC Dialogue Generation) for generating dialogue trees between video game characters. The dataset contains dialogue trees extracted from the RPG The Outer Worlds, annotated with quest objectives and biographical facts about entities. The task is to generate coherent and engaging dialogue trees that accurately reflect the provided quest and entity knowledge. The authors propose neural models termed DialogueWriters that leverage language models like GPT-3 to generate utterances conditioned on knowledge facts and dialogue history. Experiments compare variations like supervised learning vs in-context learning, and conditioning on full vs partial knowledge. Results show competent dialogue generation, but room for improvement in accurately covering objectives and reasoning over facts. Overall, the paper prescribes a promising direction for research on generating high-quality game dialogues that interweave quest narratives with character biographies.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset called KNUDGE (Knowledge Constrained User-NPC Dialogue Generation) which contains dialog trees extracted from the video game The Outer Worlds. For each dialog tree, the dataset includes the quest objectives, biographical information about characters, and annotations linking parts of the dialog to supporting facts. The authors also propose the task of knowledge-constrained NPC dialog generation, where the goal is to generate coherent and realistic dialog trees that accurately reflect the provided quest and character biographies. They introduce DialogWriter models which leverage large language models like GPT-3 to generate dialog conditioned on the quest/bio constraints and dialog history. Experiments find the models can produce reasonable outputs, but still fall short of human quality dialog. The dataset provides a challenging testbed for future work on faithful game dialog generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces a set of neural models called DialogueWriters for generating NPC dialogue trees in the game The Outer Worlds. The models take as input the quest and biography ontology specifications as well as a partial dialogue subtree. They output candidate utterances to extend the subtree. The DialogueWriters utilize language models like GPT-3 and T5 in two main ways: 1) supervised learning by fine-tuning T5 on task data to generate next utterances, and 2) in-context learning by formatting the inputs into prompts for GPT-3 to naturally continue. The prompts can be zero-shot with just the current example or few-shot with additional training examples. To encourage use of the input ontology, some DialogueWriters have an explicit knowledge selection step before utterance generation where they select relevant facts. The methods are evaluated both automatically and via human annotation, and results show they can generate coherent and ontologically consistent utterances but still lag behind human performance.
