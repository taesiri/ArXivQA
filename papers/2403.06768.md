# [XB-MAML: Learning Expandable Basis Parameters for Effective   Meta-Learning with Wide Task Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06768)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "XB-MAML: Learning Expandable Basis Parameters for Effective Meta-Learning with Wide Task Coverage":

Problem:
- Existing meta-learning methods like MAML try to learn a single initialization model that can quickly adapt to new tasks. However, a single model struggles to adapt effectively across a diverse range of tasks from different domains or datasets.
- Recent works have tried using multiple initializations to cover more tasks, but have limitations: 1) The number of initializations is fixed and not expandable 2) The initializations are selected, not combined, to adapt to each task.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes XB-MAML, which learns a set of "basis parameters" that are linearly combined to form effective initializations for adapting to tasks.
- It starts with a single initialization, then progressively adds additional bases over time if the current bases struggle to cover the task distribution.
- To determine if more bases are needed, it projects fine-tuned parameters onto the subspace spanned by the current bases. If the projection error is high, more bases are added by sampling from a Gaussian model.
- The bases are encouraged to be orthogonal via a regularization loss. Linearly combining orthogonal bases allows wider coverage of the parameter space.

Main Contributions:
- XB-MAML incrementally expands its set of basis parameters to stretch over diverse tasks, unlike fixed multi-initialization methods.
- The bases are linearly combined, rather than just selected, to form tailored initializations for each task.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on challenging multi-domain few-shot benchmarks like Meta-Dataset, demonstrating wider task coverage.
- It provides a new paradigm for meta-learning to obtain diverse inductive biases that can be combined to effectively initialize for many unseen tasks.
