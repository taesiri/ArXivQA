# [CineMPC: A Fully Autonomous Drone Cinematography System Incorporating   Zoom, Focus, Pose, and Scene Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing autonomous aerial filming platforms only control the extrinsic parameters (position and orientation) of the camera, limiting the range of cinematographic effects that can be achieved. Key intrinsic parameters like focus, depth of field, and zoom are not accounted for. Moreover, most platforms rely on motion capture systems or simulated environments rather than real-world perception for tracking.

Proposed Solution - CineMPC:
The authors propose CineMPC, the first autonomous aerial filming platform that controls both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera in a unified framework. CineMPC leverages a perception module to track multiple dynamic targets from RGB-D images and determines their 3D pose. This information is fed into a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation that optimizes camera intrinsics alongside extrinsics to meet user-specified filming objectives over a horizon. Objectives relate to composition, focus, perspective, and more. An onboard low-level controller transforms the MPC outputs into smooth actuator commands for the multicopter and camera.

Key Contributions:
- Novel MPC problem formulation to control intrinsic & extrinsic parameters under constraints 
- Perception module to estimate 3D pose of targets from thin-lens distorted images
- Complete system implementation with modular ROS architecture
- User interface for specifying filming requirements  
- Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world with a custom multicopter demonstrating:
   - Impact of controlling intrinsics for cinematography
   - Feasibility of real-time execution
   - Robustness of perception module
   - Handling of constraints like occlusion avoidance

The solution represents an important step towards fully automated cinematography with aerial robots. The modular design and public code release also make CineMPC suitable for extension and integration into other platforms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

CineMPC is a cinematography platform that autonomously controls a drone and camera by optimizing intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to achieve user-specified artistic objectives while tracking multiple dynamic targets using an RGB-D camera and perception system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel optimal control problem within a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enable autonomous control of not only the extrinsic (position, orientation) but also the intrinsic (focus, zoom, aperture) parameters of a drone camera. This facilitates capturing cinematographic effects that were not possible before.

2. It integrates the control solution with a perception module that can track 3D poses of multiple moving targets from RGB-D images, even when the images contain distortions from modifying the camera intrinsics.

3. It provides a modular ROS implementation of the complete system to promote widespread adoption. The code is integrated with a photo-realistic simulator for testing.

4. It delves into practical implementation details associated with building an autonomous cinematography platform on a real drone.

5. It demonstrates the system's capabilities through extensive experiments, both in simulation and on a real drone, showing that it can achieve various artistic objectives and cinematography shots while handling constraints.

In summary, the main contribution is the design and demonstration of an integrated system called CineMPC that can autonomously control both intrinsic and extrinsic drone camera parameters to film scenes and track targets according to specified cinematographic objectives.

The paper presents an autonomous drone cinematography system called CineMPC that controls both the extrinsic parameters (drone position and orientation) as well as intrinsic parameters (focus, focal length, aperture) of a camera to achieve desired cinematographic effects and shots. A perception module tracks target poses from camera images while a model predictive control module plans optimal trajectories for the drone and camera. Constraints related to depth of field, artistic composition, relative camera-target positioning, collisions, and occlusions are handled. The system is demonstrated in simulation and on a real drone platform.
