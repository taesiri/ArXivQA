# [Approximation of Convex Envelope Using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14421)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach to approximate the convex envelope of a non-convex function. It builds on prior work by Oberman showing that computing the convex envelope can be formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem. The authors discretize this control formulation as a controlled Markov chain and derive a Q-learning algorithm to solve the associated dynamic programming equation. They initialize the Q-values to exceed the function's maximum over the domain, as theory suggests this will lead to convergence to the maximal solution corresponding to the desired convex envelope. The method is tested on various benchmark non-convex functions in 1D and 2D, obtaining convex envelopes that closely approximate the true ones away from the domain boundaries. Key future directions are scaling to higher dimensions, embedding within an overall scheme to optimize the original non-convex function, establishing theoretical convergence guarantees, and deriving finite-sample error bounds.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a reinforcement learning scheme based on Q-learning for controlled optimal stopping to approximate the convex envelope of a non-convex function, following a stochastic control formulation proposed by Oberman.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The development of a reinforcement learning scheme, specifically a variant of Q-learning, to approximate the convex envelope of a non-convex function. The key ideas are:

1) Leveraging the connection between computing the convex envelope and an optimal stopping stochastic control problem, as established by Oberman. This facilitates formulating it as a Q-learning problem.

2) Proposing a specific controlled Markov chain based discretization scheme to enable applying Q-learning.

3) Presenting a Q-learning algorithm for this problem and analyzing its convergence properties.  

4) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on a suite of test problems, obtaining convex envelopes that closely approximate the true ones.

In summary, the main novelty seems to be the formulation of computing convex envelopes as a reinforcement learning problem and developing an algorithm based on that. Both the problem formulation and the algorithm appear to be novel contributions. The experimental results on test problems validate the approach.

The paper develops a reinforcement learning scheme using Q-learning to approximate the convex envelope of non-convex functions. It connects this to a stochastic optimal stopping problem formulated by Oberman. The method is demonstrated on various test functions from non-convex optimization. So the key terms reflect this focus on approximating convex envelopes, using ideas from reinforcement learning and stochastic control.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper approximates the controlled diffusion process with a controlled Markov chain. What is the justification provided in the paper for the specific choice of transition probabilities in this Markov chain? How can we analyze the approximation error rigorously?

2. The paper argues that the solution to the dynamic programming equation will converge to the maximal equilibrium under synchronous value iteration. However, only an asynchronous stochastic iterative scheme is proposed. What modifications are needed to propose a synchronous scheme? How can we analyze its convergence?

3. The Q-learning update given in (8) contains a conditional expectation which is replaced by a single sample in (9). Can we characterize the bias introduced due to this replacement? How does this bias vanish asymptotically? 

4. It is mentioned that the o.d.e. approach to stochastic approximation can be used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the iterative Q-learning scheme. Can we make this analysis rigorous by verifying the standard conditions required for this approach?

5. The control variable $z$ is introduced to transform the optimal stopping problem into a Q-learning framework. Is there an alternative way to apply Q-learning directly to optimal stopping problems without introducing an extra control?

6. It is argued heuristically that the iterations will converge to the maximal equilibrium if initiated above it. Can we make this argument precise by using the theory of monotone dynamical systems? What are the technical difficulties in applying the standard results?

7. The approximation scheme uses a rectangular discretization of the state space. Can we extend it to more general discretization schemes? How will the analysis be modified?

8. The method estimates the convex envelope on a compact domain by controlling at the boundaries. Can the method be extended for estimation over the entire Euclidean space without boundedness assumptions?

9. The experiments are limited to low-dimensional problems. What modifications are needed in the method to make it scale to high-dimensional problems?

10. The optimal stopping formulation requires the martingality of the noise process. How can this requirement be relaxed to allow more general noise processes?
