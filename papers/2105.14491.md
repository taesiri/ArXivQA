# [How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How attentive are graph attention networks (GATs)? In particular, does the popular GAT architecture actually compute the kind of expressive, dynamic attention it is intended and assumed to compute?The key hypothesis put forth in the paper is that GATs do not actually compute dynamic attention due to the way their attention mechanism is designed. Instead, GATs compute a more limited form of static attention. The paper introduces formal definitions of static and dynamic attention to investigate this hypothesis, both theoretically and empirically.In summary, the main research question revolves around evaluating how attentive and expressive the attention mechanisms in GATs really are, compared to their intended purpose and assumed capabilities. The central hypothesis is that their attention is more static than dynamic due to specific limitations in their design.
