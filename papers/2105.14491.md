# [How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How attentive are graph attention networks (GATs)? In particular, does the popular GAT architecture actually compute the kind of expressive, dynamic attention it is intended and assumed to compute?The key hypothesis put forth in the paper is that GATs do not actually compute dynamic attention due to the way their attention mechanism is designed. Instead, GATs compute a more limited form of static attention. The paper introduces formal definitions of static and dynamic attention to investigate this hypothesis, both theoretically and empirically.In summary, the main research question revolves around evaluating how attentive and expressive the attention mechanisms in GATs really are, compared to their intended purpose and assumed capabilities. The central hypothesis is that their attention is more static than dynamic due to specific limitations in their design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Identifying that the popular Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture actually computes a limited form of "static" attention, rather than the more expressive "dynamic" attention that it seems to compute. The authors formally define static and dynamic attention and prove theoretically that GAT can only compute static attention.2. Introducing a simple fix to GAT, by modifying the order of operations, to create GATv2. They prove GATv2 can compute dynamic attention.3. Demonstrating empirically on a synthetic problem that GAT cannot express dynamic attention and fails to fit the training data, while GATv2 succeeds.4. Showing GATv2 is more robust to noise/edges in graph data compared to GAT, thanks to its dynamic attention. 5. Comparing GAT and GATv2 extensively on 12 graph benchmarks and finding GATv2 outperforms GAT in all cases, sometimes significantly.In summary, the key contributions are formally analyzing the limitations of GAT's attention mechanism, proposing a simple fix to make it more expressive, and demonstrating improved performance empirically in a variety of graph tasks. The identification of GAT's limitations and the enhanced GATv2 architecture seem to be the main innovations presented.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of graph neural networks:- This paper focuses specifically on analyzing the graph attention mechanism in Graph Attention Networks (GATs). It provides formal definitions and theorems characterizing the difference between "static" and "dynamic" attention, which is a novel theoretical contribution not seen in most prior GNN papers. - The paper introduces a modified version of GAT called GATv2 that computes dynamic attention. Other recent papers have also proposed new variants of GAT, but they have different motivations and mechanisms. For example, works like GaAN and Masked GAT aimed to improve scalability, not expressiveness.- The extensive empirical evaluation across 12 graph benchmarks is quite thorough compared to most prior GNN papers. Many papers include results on just 1-2 small datasets. The comparisons to GAT and multiple baselines on varied tasks helps demonstrate the benefits of dynamic attention.- Most prior empirical evaluations of new GNN models are on node classification. This paper includes node, link and graph prediction tasks. Evaluating on multiple downstream applications strengthens the evidence that dynamic attention helps.- The analysis of model robustness to edge noise is an interesting experiment that provides insight into the benefits of dynamic vs static attention. Most papers don't evaluate model robustness empirically.- The comparisons are done mainly between GAT and GATv2. Many recent papers introduce entirely new models rather than improving existing models like GAT. The incremental improvement approach here is somewhat uncommon lately.So in summary, the formal theoretical analysis, introduction of dynamic attention, extensive empirical methodology, and focus on improving GAT help differentiate this paper from related work in the field. The comparisons between attention types and robustness experiments are novel contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper identifies a limitation in the popular Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture - that it can only compute a restricted form of "static" attention where the ranking of attention scores is fixed globally, and proposes a simple modification called GATv2 that allows dynamic attention where the attention ranking can vary based on the query node.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of the paper suggest a few future research directions:- Developing more robust and efficient optimization methods for training graph neural networks. The paper notes that current training methods like stochastic gradient descent can be unstable for some graph learning tasks. New optimization techniques may help improve training performance.- Exploring different graph convolutional architectures beyond the ones discussed in the paper. The authors propose simple graph convolutional networks based on spectral and spatial methods, but other architectures like attention-based networks could be promising. - Applying graph neural networks to additional domains like social networks, knowledge graphs, 3D point clouds, and combinatorial optimization problems. The paper focuses on applications in chemistry and physics, but graph networks may be useful for many other data types.- Combining graph neural networks with other deep learning techniques like convolutional and recurrent networks. Integrating graph networks with other neural architectures could lead to more powerful hybrid models.- Developing methods to interpret and explain the representations and predictions of graph neural networks. Improving model interpretability could increase adoption.- Benchmarking graph neural networks on additional datasets to systematically compare different methods. More rigorous empirical analysis is needed.- Exploring unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques for graph representation learning. Most current methods rely on labeled data.- Developing techniques to handle large-scale graph data. Current methods have trouble scaling to massive graphs with millions of nodes.So in summary, the authors propose advancing graph neural networks via better training techniques, new architectures, expanded applications, integration with other networks, interpretability, benchmarking, semi-supervised learning, and scalability. Overall, there are many exciting open research questions as graph neural networks are still an emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Graph Attention Networks (GATs), a new neural network architecture for graph-structured data. GATs incorporate attention mechanisms which allow nodes in a graph to attend to their neighborhood. Each node computes attention coefficients to weigh and aggregate features from its neighboring nodes. By using attention, GATs improve over previous graph neural networks that simply averaged neighborhood features. The authors show that GATs achieve state-of-the-art performance across several graph-based benchmarks including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks. The simplicity and effectiveness of GATs has made them one of the most popular and widely used graph neural network architectures.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the expressive power of Graph Attention Networks (GATs). GATs are a popular Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that employs attention mechanisms to allow nodes in a graph to attend to their neighbors. The authors show that standard GATs employ a restricted form of "static" attention, where the attention weights between nodes are fixed regardless of the node being attended to. They prove this limitation theoretically and demonstrate it through experiments on a simple graph problem that GATs fail to solve. To address this, they propose a modification called GATv2 that employs more powerful "dynamic" attention, where attention weights can vary depending on the context. GATv2 simply modifies the ordering of operations in the GAT architecture. Through experiments across a range of graph learning benchmarks, the authors demonstrate that GATv2 consistently outperforms standard GATs by a significant margin.In summary, this paper provides a theoretical analysis showing limitations in the attention mechanism of standard GAT architectures. The authors demonstrate this limitation empirically and propose a simple modification, GATv2, that provides more expressive dynamic attention. Experiments across a range of tasks show GATv2 consistently improves over GAT, highlighting the benefits of the more flexible attention mechanism. Theoretically identifying the restricted nature of GAT's attention and proposing an improved version is the key contribution of this work.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a graph neural network architecture called Graph Attention Network (GAT) for representation learning on graph-structured data. GAT allows each node in the graph to attend over its neighbors, by computing attention coefficients that indicate the importance of each neighbor's features to the node. Specifically, GAT employs a self-attention scoring function to compute unnormalized attention coefficients between a node and each of its neighbors. The scoring function takes the node's feature vector and each neighbor's feature vector as input, applies separate linear transformations to each, concatenates them, and applies a LeakyReLU nonlinearity. These attention scores are then normalized across the neighbors using a softmax function to produce attention coefficients. Each node computes a new feature vector as the weighted sum of the linear transformations of its neighbors' features, weighted by the attention coefficients. By enabling nodes to attend differently to their neighbors based on the node and neighbor features, GAT improves over graph convolutions that treat all neighbors equally. The overall GAT layer allows multi-head attention and concatenates the outputs from each head. Multiple GAT layers can be stacked to learn hierarchical representations of the graph.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

This paper titled "How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?" is addressing the question of how expressive and attentive the popular Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture really is. The key points are:- GAT is one of the most widely used and popular GNN architectures, considered state-of-the-art for representation learning on graphs. It supposedly computes attention between graph nodes similarly to attention mechanisms in NLP models like transformers. - However, the authors show that GAT actually computes a very limited type of "static" attention where the ranking/weighting of attention scores is fixed globally across all nodes, rather than conditioned on the specific query node. This makes it less expressive and attentive.- They formally define and analyze "static" vs "dynamic" attention, and theoretically prove the limitations of standard GAT attention.- They propose a simple modification to GAT, called GATv2, that makes the attention mechanism dynamic and more powerful. - Through extensive experiments on 12 benchmarks, they demonstrate GATv2 outperforms GAT, especially on complex relational tasks, while keeping computational costs similar.So in summary, the key point is identifying an expressiveness limitation in the popular GAT architecture, formally characterizing it, and proposing an improved dynamic attention mechanism for GNNs. The paper makes both theoretical contributions around GNN expressiveness as well as empirical contributions demonstrating the benefits of the proposed GATv2 model.
