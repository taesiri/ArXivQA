# [CR-FIQA: Face Image Quality Assessment by Learning Sample Relative   Classifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06592)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes a new face image quality assessment (FIQA) method called CR-FIQA that estimates the utility of a face image for facial recognition by learning to predict the relative classifiability of samples. - The main hypothesis is that the properties that cause a face sample to be more relatively classifiable during FR model training (i.e. closer to its class center and farther from other class centers) make it a higher quality sample for FR.- To learn to predict classifiability, CR-FIQA is trained to regress an internal network observation called the Certainty Ratio (CR) that measures relative closeness of a sample to its own class vs nearest negative class during FR training. - The paper proves empirically that CR correlates to face image quality/utility and uses that to learn to predict quality of new samples by training to predict their CR.- The key research questions addressed are:  - Is there a relationship between classifiability of a face sample during FR training and its utility/quality for FR?  - Can we learn to predict the relative classifiability of new samples to estimate their quality?  - Does simultaneously learning classifiability and optimizing class centers during FR training work better than decoupled approaches?In summary, the central hypothesis is that face image quality is linked to relative classifiability, and the key question is whether CR-FIQA can effectively learn to predict this classifiability to estimate quality. Experiments aim to validate the relationship between classifiability and quality and evaluate CR-FIQA's ability to predict quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel face image quality assessment (FIQA) method called CR-FIQA. The key ideas are:- It learns to predict the relative classifiability of face samples based on their position in feature space relative to class centers during training. This relates to face image quality.- It simultaneously optimizes the feature representation and learns to predict this relative classifiability through an added regression layer. - It empirically shows the correlation between sample classifiability and face image quality.- It demonstrates through experiments that CR-FIQA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 8 benchmarks using 4 face recognition models.In summary, the main novelty is in learning to predict an internal network observation during training that correlates with face image quality, and using this to estimate the quality of unseen samples. This is shown to be more effective than prior FIQA methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new face image quality assessment method called CR-FIQA that learns to predict the relative classifiability of face images compared to their class center during face recognition model training, and shows it outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in face image quality assessment (FIQA):- The main innovation of this paper is proposing a new approach called CR-FIQA that learns to predict sample classifiability during face recognition model training, and uses that to estimate face image quality. This is different from prior works that either labeled quality scores for supervised learning, or derived quality from embedding properties without explicit learning.- The paper proves a strong correlation between sample classifiability (measured by the proposed Certainty Ratio) and face image quality. This is a key theoretical contribution not shown clearly in prior works. - The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of CR-FIQA over prior methods like RankIQ, PFE, SER-FIQ, FaceQNet, MagFace, SDD-FIQA across multiple benchmarks and face recognition models. This shows strong empirical evidence for the efficacy of the approach.- Unlike some prior works that don't require explicit training like SER-FIQ and MagFace, CR-FIQA requires training a quality regression model. But it shows much better generalization across face models.- The simultaneous training of classifiability prediction along with class center optimization is unique to CR-FIQA and shown to be better than standalone or on-top training.- The paper provides useful ablation studies on the benefits of the Certainty Ratio formulation and the simultaneous training approach. This level of analysis is missing in most prior FIQA papers.Overall, the paper presents a novel FIQA paradigm with strong theoretical motivation, extensive experiments, and state-of-the-art results. The key innovations like Certainty Ratio and simultaneous training provide valuable contributions over existing literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing FIQA methods that do not rely on pre-labeled quality data for training. The authors suggest exploring approaches like their proposed CR-FIQA that learn from internal observations during FR training rather than external quality labels.- Exploring the benefit of combining general IQA and specialized FIQA methods. The authors suggest hybrid approaches could complement the advantages of both types of methods.- Evaluating how effective different FIQA methods are on very large-scale FR training datasets, which may exhibit more varied quality. The authors suggest most current FIQA evaluations use smaller datasets.- Developing techniques to better understand the root factors leading to poor quality scores for face images, in order to guide data curation and pre-processing.- Investigating FIQA for video-based face recognition, since most research has focused on still images. The authors suggest adapting FIQA concepts to video frames.- Studying the interplay between factors like age, pose, and expression with quality assessment. The authors suggest current methods don't explicitly model these interactions.- Validating FIQA effectiveness on a larger diversity of recognition models, especially newer deep learning based approaches. Most works focus on a limited set.- Considering computational efficiency and device constraints like memory along with accuracy for practical FIQA deployment. The authors suggest exploring efficient network architectures.In summary, the authors highlight needs for FIQA that requires less supervision, integration with IQA, scalability, diagnostics, video analysis, factor modeling, model generality, and efficiency as directions for future work.
