# [CR-FIQA: Face Image Quality Assessment by Learning Sample Relative   Classifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06592)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes a new face image quality assessment (FIQA) method called CR-FIQA that estimates the utility of a face image for facial recognition by learning to predict the relative classifiability of samples. - The main hypothesis is that the properties that cause a face sample to be more relatively classifiable during FR model training (i.e. closer to its class center and farther from other class centers) make it a higher quality sample for FR.- To learn to predict classifiability, CR-FIQA is trained to regress an internal network observation called the Certainty Ratio (CR) that measures relative closeness of a sample to its own class vs nearest negative class during FR training. - The paper proves empirically that CR correlates to face image quality/utility and uses that to learn to predict quality of new samples by training to predict their CR.- The key research questions addressed are:  - Is there a relationship between classifiability of a face sample during FR training and its utility/quality for FR?  - Can we learn to predict the relative classifiability of new samples to estimate their quality?  - Does simultaneously learning classifiability and optimizing class centers during FR training work better than decoupled approaches?In summary, the central hypothesis is that face image quality is linked to relative classifiability, and the key question is whether CR-FIQA can effectively learn to predict this classifiability to estimate quality. Experiments aim to validate the relationship between classifiability and quality and evaluate CR-FIQA's ability to predict quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel face image quality assessment (FIQA) method called CR-FIQA. The key ideas are:- It learns to predict the relative classifiability of face samples based on their position in feature space relative to class centers during training. This relates to face image quality.- It simultaneously optimizes the feature representation and learns to predict this relative classifiability through an added regression layer. - It empirically shows the correlation between sample classifiability and face image quality.- It demonstrates through experiments that CR-FIQA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 8 benchmarks using 4 face recognition models.In summary, the main novelty is in learning to predict an internal network observation during training that correlates with face image quality, and using this to estimate the quality of unseen samples. This is shown to be more effective than prior FIQA methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new face image quality assessment method called CR-FIQA that learns to predict the relative classifiability of face images compared to their class center during face recognition model training, and shows it outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.
