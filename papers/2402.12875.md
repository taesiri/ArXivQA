# [Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies why chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where models generate intermediate reasoning steps, improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical and symbolic reasoning tasks. The efficacy of CoT is surprising since LLMs still benefit from CoT even when the intermediate steps are uninformative or incorrect. The goal of the paper is to understand the mechanism behind why the form of CoT matters.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper hypothesizes that CoT allows LLMs to perform more serial computations compared to vanilla transformers, making them more expressive. The authors formalize this using circuit complexity theory. They define a complexity class Cot[T(n)][d(n)][s(n)][e(n)] that captures the problems solvable by constant-depth transformers with T(n) steps of CoT, embedding dimension d(n), precision s(n) bits, and exponent bits e(n).

Main Contributions:
1) Tighter upper bounds on expressiveness of no-CoT transformers: no-CoT transformers with constant precision can only solve problems in AC0, a proper subset of TC0 that prior works showed. 

2) CoT makes transformers provably more expressive: With T(n) steps of CoT and O(log n) embedding, transformers can simulate circuits with T(n) gates. This means polynomial steps of CoT allows solving P-complete problems.

3) CoT enables solving inherently serial problems: The paper shows an example problem, permutation composition, which is conjectured to require serial computation. Experiments confirm vanilla transformers struggle on this but accuracy dramatically improves with CoT enabled.

In summary, the paper provides a theoretical understanding that CoT allows transformers to perform more serial computation compared to no CoT, which makes them more expressive, especially for solving inherently serial problems. Empirical evaluations support the theory.
