# [Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial   Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies why chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where models generate intermediate reasoning steps, improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical and symbolic reasoning tasks. The efficacy of CoT is surprising since LLMs still benefit from CoT even when the intermediate steps are uninformative or incorrect. The goal of the paper is to understand the mechanism behind why the form of CoT matters.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper hypothesizes that CoT allows LLMs to perform more serial computations compared to vanilla transformers, making them more expressive. The authors formalize this using circuit complexity theory. They define a complexity class Cot[T(n)][d(n)][s(n)][e(n)] that captures the problems solvable by constant-depth transformers with T(n) steps of CoT, embedding dimension d(n), precision s(n) bits, and exponent bits e(n).

Main Contributions:
1) Tighter upper bounds on expressiveness of no-CoT transformers: no-CoT transformers with constant precision can only solve problems in AC0, a proper subset of TC0 that prior works showed. 

2) CoT makes transformers provably more expressive: With T(n) steps of CoT and O(log n) embedding, transformers can simulate circuits with T(n) gates. This means polynomial steps of CoT allows solving P-complete problems.

3) CoT enables solving inherently serial problems: The paper shows an example problem, permutation composition, which is conjectured to require serial computation. Experiments confirm vanilla transformers struggle on this but accuracy dramatically improves with CoT enabled.

In summary, the paper provides a theoretical understanding that CoT allows transformers to perform more serial computation compared to no CoT, which makes them more expressive, especially for solving inherently serial problems. Empirical evaluations support the theory.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a theoretical understanding of how enabling transformers to generate intermediate reasoning steps (chain of thought) allows them to perform more complex, serial computations which they cannot perform without chain of thought.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing new theoretical understanding of how chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning empowers transformers to solve inherently serial problems that they otherwise cannot solve effectively without CoT. Specifically:

1) The paper shows tighter expressiveness upper bounds for constant-precision transformers without CoT, proving they can only solve problems in the complexity class AC^0 which is quite limited. 

2) The paper proves that with polynomially many steps of CoT, even constant-precision transformers with only O(log n) embedding size can simulate circuits with polynomial size, thus solving problems in a much more expressive class Ppoly. This suggests CoT allows transformers to perform serial computations they cannot do in parallel without CoT.

3) The paper corroborates the theory with experiments on problems widely believed to require serial computations (e.g. permutation composition), showing CoT substantially improves transformer performance on them, especially for shallow transformers.

In summary, the paper provides a nice theoretical characterization and understanding of how CoT enhances the reasoning capability of transformers by enabling more serial computation. The theory and experiments support each other nicely.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Chain of Thought (CoT): Intermediate reasoning steps generated by language models to improve performance on reasoning tasks. A main focus of the paper. 

- Expressiveness: The complexity of functions/problems that can be represented by a model architecture. Key lens used in the paper to study CoT.

- Circuit complexity: Computational models like Boolean circuits used to characterize expressiveness. Classes like TC0, AC0, and Ppoly feature prominently.  

- Inherently serial problems: Problems like permutation composition and circuit value problems that seem to inherently require serial steps to solve. Used as case studies in the paper.

- Decoder-only transformers: Specific transformer architecture studied. Lacks encoder-decoder attention.

- Constant precision: Studying transformers with fixed, finite precision rather than increasing precision. More realistic.

- Proof techniques: Use of automata theory, grouping theorem, circuit complexity to prove results on expressiveness.

So in summary, terms related to CoT, expressiveness, constant precision transformers, circuit complexity classes, and serial reasoning problems are central to this work. The theoretical analysis relies heavily on complexity, automata theory, etc.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that Chain of Thought (CoT) allows transformers to perform more serial computations than parallel computations alone. Can you explain the theoretical justification behind why this is the case? How does generating intermediate reasoning steps enable more serial computations?

2. The paper defines a new complexity class $\mathsf{CoT}$ to characterize the expressiveness of transformers with CoT. Can you explain the key properties of this complexity class and how it relates to circuit complexity classes like $\mathsf{TC}^0$? 

3. The paper proves an upper bound that constant-depth, constant-precision transformers without CoT can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$. Can you explain why allowing exponents makes proving circuits for iterative rounding harder compared to integer addition?

4. The paper shows that constant-depth transformers with polynomially many CoT steps and $O(\log n)$ embedding can simulate boolean circuits with polynomial size. What is the high-level intuition behind the construction used in the proof?

5. The paper empirically evaluates transformers on four arithmetic tasks. Why were these specific tasks chosen? What do the results on these tasks tell us about the benefit of CoT?

6. The paper focuses on studying the benefit of CoT for constant-depth transformers. How would you expect the conclusions to change if transformers with larger depth were considered instead?

7. The proof techniques rely heavily on viewing iterative rounding for floating point addition as an automaton. What property of this automaton enables proving the $\mathsf{AC}^0$ upper bound? 

8. The paper allows different transformer parameters for different input lengths. Do you think this non-uniformity assumption is realistic or practical? Why or why not?

9. One open question mentioned is whether constant-depth log-precision transformers with log bits for exponents fall into $\mathsf{TC}^0$. What makes proving circuits for this setting difficult?

10. What are some ways the theoretical characterization of CoT provided in this paper could guide further empirical analysis of CoT methods for transformers? What new experiments could be motivated by the theory?
