# [Gender Inflected or Bias Inflicted: On Using Grammatical Gender Cues for   Bias Evaluation in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most prior work on evaluating gender bias in neural machine translation (NMT) focuses on English as the source language. However, evaluation methods don't directly apply to other languages, especially ones with grammatical gender like Hindi.
- Existing methods like Translation Gender Bias Index (TGBI) use gender-neutral source sentences. But in practice, sentences often contain inherent gender information. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use Hindi as a source language to demonstrate limitations of existing bias evaluation methods.
- Propose new context-based evaluation using grammatical gender markers of the source language. 
- Construct two test sets for bias evaluation of Hindi-English NMT:
   - OTSC-Hindi: occupation-based sentences with simple context
   - WinoMT-Hindi: more complex sentences with multiple entities and coreferences
- Automatically evaluate bias in translation of these sets by checking for gendered pronouns.

Key Contributions:
- Show limitations of existing gender-neutral evaluation methods like TGBI for languages with grammatical gender.
- Highlight the need to account for gender inflections in the source language when evaluating bias.  
- Create two new test sets OTSC-Hindi and WinoMT-Hindi for evaluating gender bias in Hindi-English NMT.
- Evaluate bias in multiple state-of-the-art HI-EN translation systems using the new test sets. 
- Demonstrate the importance of creating such bias evaluation benchmarks for other languages with expressive gender markers.

In summary, the key idea is to evaluate gender bias in NMT by using source sentences with inherent gender information marked through grammatical devices, instead of just using gender-neutral sentences. This better exposes hidden gender bias in translation models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes new methods to evaluate gender bias in neural machine translation models using Hindi as the source language and constructing test sets with grammatical gender cues to determine if models can identify correct gender from context rather than relying on biased correlations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Highlighting the limitations of existing gender bias evaluation methods for machine translation that use gender-neutral source sentences, especially for languages like Hindi that have rich grammatical gender markers. 

2) Proposing new context-based gender bias evaluation using grammatical gender cues in the source language (Hindi). Specifically, constructing two new test sets for bias evaluation - OTSC-Hindi and WinoMT-Hindi.

3) Using these new test sets to evaluate several Hindi-English machine translation systems and demonstrating their ability to expose gender biases that are not revealed by metrics like Translation Gender Bias Index (TGBI) that use gender-neutral sentences. 

4) Emphasizing the importance of creating evaluation benchmarks that account for the grammatical gender system of the particular source language when evaluating gender bias in machine translation.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the need for and constructing new context-based, gender-marked test sets for evaluating gender bias in machine translation for languages like Hindi by taking into account the gender inflections present in the source language.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Gender bias evaluation in neural machine translation (NMT)
- Translation Gender Bias Index (TGBI) 
- Gender-neutral vs gender-specific sentences for bias evaluation
- Hindi as a source language with rich grammatical gender markers
- Occupation Testset with Simple Context (OTSC-Hindi)
- WinoMT-Hindi dataset
- Automatic bias evaluation using template sentences and gender cues
- Importance of considering source language characteristics for bias evaluation

The paper focuses on evaluating gender bias in Hindi-English machine translation by creating new test sets that leverage the grammatical gender system in Hindi. Key ideas include using gender-specific sentences rather than just gender-neutral ones, the limitations of metrics like TGBI, and the need to tailor bias evaluation methods to the nuances of the source language. The OTSC-Hindi and WinoMT-Hindi datasets are constructed to enable automatic bias evaluation without human translations. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of accounting for gender markers and linguistic properties when designing bias evaluation benchmarks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using grammatical gender cues in the source language for evaluating gender bias in machine translation. Why is this a better approach compared to using gender-neutral source sentences? Discuss the limitations of current methods that rely on gender-neutral sentences.

2. The paper constructs two test sets - OTSC-Hindi and WinoMT-Hindi. Compare and contrast these two test sets in terms of the type of sentences, context, complexity, method of automatic evaluation etc. What are the relative merits and demerits of each?

3. The OTSC-Hindi test set relies on a template with occupation terms to evaluate bias. Discuss the process of creating pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical occupation sets. What are some limitations of relying on US labor statistics for Hindi? Suggest ways to improve occupation stereotyping.  

4. The paper finds that high TGBI scores on gender-neutral sentences did not translate to low bias on gendered test sets for some systems. Analyze reasons why TGBI might not accurately capture true system fairness. Discuss metrics better suited for gendered test sets.

5. The WinoMT-Hindi test set is more complex and aims to evaluate bias in coreference resolution. Explain the process of constructing this test set and how automatic evaluation is enabled. Discuss potential reasons for the observed low âˆ†S scores.

6. The paper demonstrates evaluation for Hindi-English translation. Discuss challenges in expanding such methods to other language pairs. What are some practical difficulties in constructing large enough gendered test sets? Suggest ways to scale up.

7. Discuss the societal impacts of having biased Hindi-English machine translation systems. Who are the vulnerable communities affected? Suggest real world scenarios where harm can occur.  

8. The paper finds Google Translate to be the least biased system overall. Speculate on why - is it the model architecture, training data, some post processing etc? Suggest experiments to further analyze. 

9. Discuss ethical considerations in creating such gendered test sets. Could framing sentences in a stereotypical manner further perpetrate harm? Suggest ways to mitigate this.

10. The paper focuses only on the gender binary. Discuss feasibility and challenges in expanding evaluation for non-binary gender identities. What changes would be required in linguistic analysis of test sets?
