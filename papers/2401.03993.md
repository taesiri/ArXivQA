# [Behavioural Cloning in VizDoom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training autonomous agents to play video games in a human-like way is challenging. Typically agents are trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize in-game rewards like points or kills. However, this often results in non-human behaviors. 
- Imitation learning (IL) can be used to train agents that mimic human gameplay, but often requires extra data from game engines which is not always accessible.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose training agents purely from pixel input and associated keypress actions recorded from humans playing the game Doom. No extra game engine data is used.
- They train agents using behavioral cloning on data from human players with varying play styles. This allows generating agents with different personalities - aggressive, passive, balanced.

Methods:
- Data is collected from 10 human players across 41 multiplayer Doom matches. Player actions and game frames are recorded from their perspective.
- A convolutional neural network + convolutional LSTM model is trained to predict actions from image sequences in a supervised way.
- Training improvements like exponential frame skipping, signed loss for mouse movement, and label averaging are introduced.
- Agents are evaluated by their in-game performance of damage and kills against default bots.

Results:
- The best agent trained on top players outperforms agents trained on bottom players in damage, kills and navigation.
- Agents trained on individual players exhibit navigation and play style traits of that player. An aggressive, passive and balanced agent are demonstrated.
- The best agent performs on par with average human players, better than bottom players.
- Analysis shows RL agents have non-human camera movement statistics compared to humans and IL agents.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates successful game agent training using only pixel input and actions, without privileged game data.
- Introduces methods to generate agents with varying personalities.
- Provides training improvements for behavioral cloning.
- Compares and contrasts IL and RL agent behaviors.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed approach, results and contributions of the work in a way that should enable clear understanding for a human reader. Please let me know if any part needs more explanation or clarification.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores training autonomous agents to play Doom using imitation learning from human gameplay data and compares their behavior to agents trained with reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a method for training autonomous agents to play FPS games like Doom using only pixel data and associated actions, without needing access to game engine data. This makes the approach more generally applicable.

2) Comparing imitation learning (IL) agents to reinforcement learning (RL) agents in terms of performance and human-likeness of behavior. The IL agents match average human player performance while exhibiting more human-like movement and camera control than the RL agents.

3) Demonstrating that training IL agents on data from individual players leads to agents that emulate those players' implicit behaviors and play styles. This allows for diversity in agent behaviors.

4) Introducing novel techniques like exponential frame skipping and signed loss for mouse movement prediction that improve IL training stability and lead to more human-like agent behavior.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that human-like autonomous game agents can be trained using IL on just pixel inputs, outperforming less human-like RL agents, while also enabling behavioral diversity through player-specific training.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Imitation Learning (IL): A form of learning where agents are trained in a supervised manner to imitate expert demonstrations. A main approach explored in the paper.

- Reinforcement Learning (RL): A machine learning approach where agents learn by interacting with environments and receiving reward signals. Compared to IL approaches in the paper.  

- Behavioural Cloning (BC): A type of imitation learning where the goal is to clone/mimic the behavior of an expert. Used to train agents in the paper.

- ViZDoom: A Doom2-based platform used as the environment to train and test agents. 

- Autonomous Agents: Systems that can control games/devices without human interference. Key goal of research.

- Neural Networks (NN): Used as the learning models, including CNNs and LSTMs.

- Frame Skipping: A technique to increase the temporal view of the neural network inputs. An exponential frame skipping method is introduced.

- Mouse Movement: An important action variable that is modeled as continuous regression.

- Game Performance: Evaluation metrics based on in-game statistics like damage, kills and deaths. Used to assess agents.

- Trajectories: The paths and movements of agents visualized as heatmaps. Compared between agents and humans.

- Camera Control: Analyzed differences between human, IL and RL agents in terms of angular velocity and acceleration.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a convolutional LSTM layer after the initial feature extraction layers. What is the motivation behind using a convolutional LSTM versus a standard LSTM or GRU layer? How does it help capture temporal relationships in the data?

2. Exponential frame skipping is introduced as a novel approach to increase the temporal context seen by the model without increasing memory usage. Can you explain in more detail how the exponential offset formula works and why an exponent between 1 and 1.5 was chosen? 

3. The paper explores training agents on individual player data versus combined player data. What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches? Why does training on combined data lead to better performing agents overall?

4. Signed MSE loss is used for mouse movement predictions instead of standard MSE. Can you explain the motivation and formulation behind this loss? How does it lead to more human-like mouse movements? 

5. Action balancing is employed to account for imbalanced data. How exactly does this work? Why is it an important technique for imitation learning on imbalanced demonstration data?

6. The paper introduces a weighting scheme to penalize loss terms for certain overrepresented actions in the dataset. What is the effect of this penalization and how were the penalty values in Table 2 determined?

7. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using game engine data like depth, labels, etc versus just RGB frames? Why did the authors still choose to incorporate depth and labels despite focusing on end-to-end learning from pixels?

8. The paper analyzes differences in behavior between IL, RL, and human players. What conclusions can you draw about each method's ability to produce human-like behavior based on the camera movement analysis?

9. How exactly is the objective evaluation done by running trained agents in actual Doom matches? Why is this preferred over validation loss for evaluating IL agents? 

10. The paper mentions difficulties in long-sequence learning. How do techniques like exponential frame skipping and target label averaging help mitigate issues with learning long-term temporal dependencies?
