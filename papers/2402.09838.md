# [Performative Reinforcement Learning in Gradually Shifting Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09838)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers the problem of reinforcement learning (RL) agents that impact and change their environment when deployed, known as the performative reinforcement learning (PRL) setting. 
- Prior work on PRL assumed the environment only depends on the currently deployed policy. This may not hold in practice, as environments often gradually adapt over multiple policy deployments.
- The paper introduces a framework that models environments that depend on both the current policy as well as previous policies and environment dynamics. This allows modeling gradual environment shifts.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes different "repeated retraining" algorithms for finding stable policies in this setting:
    - Standard Repeated Retraining (RR): Retrain policy every round to best respond to current environment.
    - Delayed Repeated Retraining (DRR): Only retrain every k rounds, using samples from most recent round.
    - Mixed Delayed Repeated Retraining (MDRR): Novel algorithm that retrains every k rounds but uses weighted samples from multiple previous rounds.
- Provides convergence guarantees for these algorithms, analyzing regularization needs, number of retrainings, and sample complexity.

Main Contributions:  
- Extends PRL framework to capture gradual environment shifts based on previous policies and environment dynamics.
- Adapts DRR algorithm from performative prediction to PRL setting.
- Proposes MDRR algorithm that combines samples from multiple rounds to improve convergence.
- Provides convergence analysis, highlighting benefits of MDRR in environments with strong dependence on previous dynamics.
- Experiments show MDRR converges faster than RR and DRR.

In summary, the paper tackles PRL with gradual environment shifts, proposes the MDRR algorithm, and shows theoretically and empirically that utilizing historic samples, as done in MDRR, significantly improves convergence over standard approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes and analyzes algorithms for reinforcement learning agents that are deployed in environments which gradually shift over time in response to the agent's actions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework to model gradual shifts in reinforcement learning environments over time, as opposed to one-step shifts that previous performative RL frameworks assumed. It analyzes and compares three repeated retraining algorithms (RR, DRR, and a new algorithm MDRR) in this setting theoretically and empirically. The main contributions are:

1) A framework that can model gradual environment shifts in performative RL.

2) A novel repeated retraining algorithm called Mixed Delayed Repeated Retraining (MDRR) that combines samples from multiple deployment rounds to reduce sample complexity. 

3) Theoretical characterization and comparison of RR, DRR, and MDRR in terms of approximation guarantee, number of retrainings, and sample complexity. The analysis shows MDRR can attain better approximation with fewer samples per round in certain settings.

4) Empirical evaluation on a simulation testbed showing MDRR converges faster than RR and DRR.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing the gradual shift framework, a new repeated retraining algorithm suited for this setting, and an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis comparing algorithms in this framework.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Performative reinforcement learning - Studying how a reinforcement learning agent can impact and shift the environment it is acting in.

- Gradual environment shifts - Modeling scenarios where the environment changes gradually over time in response to an RL agent, rather than changing immediately.  

- Repeated retraining algorithms - Approaches like repeated retraining (RR), delayed repeated retraining (DRR), and mixed delayed repeated retraining (MDRR) that repeatedly retrain policies on updated environments.

- Characterization results - Theoretical convergence guarantees and sample complexity bounds for the different retraining algorithms. 

- Metrics for comparison - Number of retrainings, approximation guarantee, and number of samples per deployment.

- Regularization - Using regularization when modeling performative stability to make the problem theoretically tractable.

- Experimental evaluation - Comparing algorithms empirically in a simulation environment with two agents.

So in summary, key terms cover the performative RL framework, modeling of gradual shifts, retraining algorithms, theoretical analysis, comparison metrics, and experimental validation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new algorithm called Mixed Delayed Repeated Retraining (MDRR). How does MDRR balance the trade-off between using recent vs older samples in its updates? What are the theoretical justifications behind this balancing?

2. One of the key ideas in MDRR is to use a weighted combination of samples from multiple deployment rounds in the policy update step. What is the intuition behind this idea and how does it relate to the goal of faster convergence? 

3. The paper shows both theoretical characterization and experimental evaluation of MDRR compared to other baselines. What are the key theoretical results that showcase the benefits of MDRR and what are the experimental settings used to validate those claims?

4. How does the MDRR algorithm build upon and adapt ideas from the Delayed Repeated Retraining (DRR) algorithm proposed in prior work? What modifications were needed and what additional theoretical analyses were required?

5. The environment model in this paper allows for gradual shifts in the MDP over time, based on both the current policy and previous policies. How does this environment model generalize prior work and what kind of real-world scenarios is it intended to capture?

6. One of the key assumptions in the theoretical analysis is a sensitivity assumption that bounds how much the environment can change between rounds. What is the intuition behind this assumption and how does it relate to achievable performance guarantees?

7. What are the key steps in proving the finite sample convergence guarantees for MDRR? What modifications were needed compared to the analysis for DRR and how do quantities like the regularization factor Î» come into play?

8. How do the empirical results align with and validate the theoretical findings? What metrics were used to evaluate convergence and stability in the experiments? Were there any surprising outcomes?

9. The paper focuses on tabular MDPs. What complications can arise in scaling MDRR to large MDPs with function approximation and how might the theoretical analyses need to change?

10. One downside of MDRR compared to DRR is the need for more samples per deployment round. Are there any ways to further reduce this sample complexity while retaining fast convergence guarantees?
