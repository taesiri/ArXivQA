# [Ctrl123: Consistent Novel View Synthesis via Closed-Loop Transcription](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10953)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods based on diffusion models struggle to generate novel views that are accurately consistent with the ground truth poses and appearances, even on the training set. This consequently limits their performance on downstream tasks like image-to-multiview generation and 3D reconstruction. The inconsistency arises because it is difficult to enforce accurate pose and appearance alignment directly during diffusion model training, which is mostly done via separate score matching at different noise levels without holistic constraints.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Ctrl123, a closed-loop transcription-based NVS diffusion method that enforces alignment between the generated view and ground truth in a pose-sensitive feature space. Specifically:

1) Formulates current NVS methods as an open-loop autoencoder framework with separate encoder and decoder modules. 

2) Extends this to a closed-loop framework by feeding the generated views back into the encoder and minimizing the difference between their features and ground truth features. This allows pose consistency enforcement in the latent space.

3) Measures pose consistency using new metrics like Average Angle (AA) and Intersection over Union (IoU) between predicted and ground truth poses.

4) Shows an alternative training strategy involving rounds of closed-loop training and standard diffusion training works better than joint optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes Ctrl123, a novel closed-loop NVS diffusion method that uses patch features to significantly improve pose and appearance consistency over state-of-the-art like Zero123.

- Introduces metrics like AA and IoU to quantitatively measure improvements in pose consistency for NVS. 

- Demonstrates the effectiveness of Ctrl123 via extensive experiments, including on tasks like NVS and 3D reconstruction. Ctrl123 achieves much higher multiview and pose consistency compared to current methods.
