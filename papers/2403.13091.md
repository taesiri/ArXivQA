# [JaxUED: A simple and useable UED library in Jax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13091)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen great progress recently, especially with libraries like Jax that leverage hardware acceleration for faster training. However, the subfield of unsupervised environment design (UED) lacks such fast, easily modifiable implementations to accelerate research. 
- Existing RL environment interfaces implicitly impose a level distribution, which is unsuitable for UED where the goal is to adaptively generate a curriculum of levels.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce JaxUED, a minimal dependency UED library in Jax for fast, understandable implementations to accelerate UED research.
- Define a new UnderspecifiedEnv interface that explicitly separates level distribution from environments.
- Provide single-file reference implementations of UED algorithms like PLR, ACCEL and PAIRED that leverage Jax's hardware acceleration for 100x speedups.
- Implement a maze environment to showcase UED methods.

Main Contributions:
- Minimal environment interface that decouples level distribution.
- Easily modifiable, single-file implementations of UED algorithms for rapid experimentation.  
- 100x faster training compared to prior CPU implementations.
- Surprisingly find that domain randomization is competitive with state-of-the-art UED algorithms, contrary to past literature.

In summary, this paper proposes JaxUED, a fast Jax-based UED library with minimal environment interface and understandable code for rapid UED research. It achieves major speedups and shows domain randomization is an effective baseline, facilitating future work in this area.
