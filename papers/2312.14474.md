# [MonoLSS: Learnable Sample Selection For Monocular 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14474)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monocular 3D object detection aims to estimate 3D properties like depth, dimensions, and orientation from a single RGB image. However, not all image features are equally effective for learning these 3D properties. Using inappropriate features can be ambiguous or detrimental.  
- There is a need to select suitable positive samples from object features to effectively learn 3D properties. The challenge lies in how to divide positive and negative samples.

Proposed Solution - MonoLSS:
- Proposes a Learnable Sample Selection (LSS) module based on Gumbel-Softmax and relative-distance divider to address the sample selection problem in 3D property learning. It can adaptively select suitable positive samples for each object.

- Additionally proposes MixUp3D data augmentation that simulates spatial overlap of objects in a physically plausible way without introducing ambiguity. This enriches the 3D property samples for training.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies and formulates the problem of sample selection for 3D property learning in monocular detection. Develops a novel LSS module to address it.

- Devises MixUp3D data augmentation to simulate spatial overlap and enrich 3D property samples while conforming to imaging principles.

- Without any extra data, MonoLSS with LSS module and MixUp3D ranks 1st on KITTI benchmark across all difficulty levels for cars, pedestrians and cyclists. It also achieves state-of-the-art results on Waymo dataset and cross-dataset evaluation.

- The approach works end-to-end with real-time efficiency. LSS module and MixUp3D bring synergistic effects and significant performance gains.
