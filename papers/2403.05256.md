# [DuDoUniNeXt: Dual-domain unified hybrid model for single and   multi-contrast undersampled MRI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05256)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing MRI reconstruction methods either focus on single-contrast (SC) reconstruction from undersampled data of a single modality, or multi-contrast (MC) methods that utilize an auxiliary fully-sampled image from another modality.  
- SC methods perform well independently but cannot effectively utilize auxiliary images. MC methods fail when the auxiliary image is missing or low-quality (undersampled). 

Proposed Solution:
- A unified neural network called DuDoUniNeXt that can perform both SC and MC reconstruction by incorporating auxiliary images of varying quality.

Key Features:
- A dual-domain learning framework with recurrent blocks, containing a SC k-space network (K-NeXt) and a unified image recovery network (I-UniNeXt).
- I-UniNeXt has a contrast-aware encoder with two modules: 
   1) PaSS: Partially shared shallow feature extractor to process both consistent and complementary information  
   2) AdaC2F: Adaptive coarse-to-fine fusion to dynamically integrate self and reference features based on input quality.
- A CNN-ViT hybrid backbone (XBB) is used enable domain-specific adjustment of both modalities.

Main Contributions:  
- First unified network for both SC and MC reconstruction that supports auxiliary images of varying quality or even missing.
- A contrast-aware encoder to leverage complementary and consistent multi-contrast information.
- An efficient CNN-ViT hybrid backbone for domain-specific building.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on SC reconstruction and outperforms MC methods when auxiliary image is not fully-sampled.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel dual-domain dynamic neural network to unify SC and MC undersampled MRI reconstruction, which surpasses existing specialized models by effectively and adaptively exploiting multi-contrast information.
