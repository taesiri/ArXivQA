# [Emergent communication and learning pressures in language models: a   language evolution perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are mismatches between the languages developed by humans and neural network agents in emergent communication simulations. For example, neural agents do not show Zipf's law of abbreviation or benefit from compositional language structure like humans do. 
- It is questionable whether insights from neural agents can inform theories of language evolution and acquisition in humans given these mismatches.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper reviews key mismatches between humans and neural agents and how they have been resolved by incorporating relevant cognitive/communicative pressures and inductive biases into the models. 
- Identifies 4 key pressures underlying language evolution and acquisition: (1) pressure for successful communication, (2) pressure for efficient communication, (3) pressure for learnability, (4) cognitive and psycholinguistic factors.

- Shows that incorporating these pressures into emergent communication models leads neural agents to develop languages more similar to natural languages, resolving initial mismatches.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic analysis of how incorporating theory-driven inductive biases from language evolution research makes neural agents better models of human linguistic behavior.

- Concrete suggestions for designing more cognitively plausible language models by integrating pressures like efficiency, learnability constraints, production-comprehension symmetry.

- Argues knowledge exchange between language evolution and neural modeling research can lead to better models on both sides. Emergent communication work showcases how this can be done.

In summary, the paper argues emergent communication research provides a blueprint for how inductive biases can make neural models more useful for studying language acquisition, by making them better mimic key properties of natural languages.
