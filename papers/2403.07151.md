# [Don't Forget What I did?: Assessing Client Contributions in Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Fair and accurate assessment of client contributions is an important problem in Federated Learning (FL) where multiple clients collaboratively train a machine learning model without exposing private data. Existing methods rely on simplified assumptions such as all clients participating in every training epoch. The paper studies the problem of assessing client contributions in FL when only a subset of clients participate in each training epoch.

Proposed Solution - FLContrib Framework:
The paper proposes FLContrib, a history-aware game-theoretic framework to assess client contributions using Shapley values. The key ideas are:

1. Compute Shapley values per-epoch based on incremental model utility gain to account for the sequential training process in FL.

2. Aggregate per-epoch Shapley values over all epochs to obtain history-aware overall contributions. This allows assessing contributions of both participating and non-participating clients.

3. Propose a scheduling algorithm to selectively compute expensive Shapley values over epochs based on computational budget, while optimizing for fairness and model utility coverage.

Main Contributions:

1. A theoretically-grounded framework to provide exact client contributions in FL with partial client participation per epoch by leveraging properties of Shapley values.

2. Accuracy-efficiency trade-off by approximate Shapley computation and optimal scheduling over epochs based on incremental model gain and client participation fairness.

3. Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrating computational efficiency and accuracy in estimated contributions compared to state-of-the-art methods. Also demonstrates application in detecting dishonest clients from history of contributions.

The framework provides a flexible and theoretically sound approach for history-aware assessment of client contributions applicable to incentive allocation and security mechanisms in federated learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a history-aware game-theoretic framework called FLContrib to assess client contributions in federated learning by computing Shapley values over epochs, considering both participating and non-participating clients in each round.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It proposes a history-aware, game-theoretic framework called FLContrib to assess client contributions in federated learning when a subset of clients participate in each training epoch. The framework leverages Shapley values and the linearity property to incrementally compute contributions over epochs.

2. It discusses a scheduling procedure to trade off between accuracy and efficiency of contribution assessment under a computational budget. The procedure formulates an optimization problem to select a subset of epochs for contribution assessment based on both server-side and client-side fairness criteria. 

3. It demonstrates an application of the proposed framework in detecting dishonest clients conducting data poisoning in federated learning. By analyzing the historic timeline of client contributions, the framework can identify poisoning attacks and separate honest clients from dishonest ones.

In summary, the key novelty is a history-aware and flexible framework for assessing client contributions in practical federated learning settings, along with applications in improving efficiency and detecting attacks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Federated learning (FL): A collaborative machine learning approach where multiple clients participate in training a model without exposing private data.

- Client contribution: Assessing how much each client contributes to the utility (e.g. accuracy) of the global federated learning model. 

- Shapley value: A concept from cooperative game theory to quantify the contribution of each player (client) in a coalition (subset of clients).

- Utility function: A function to evaluate the federated learning model, such as loss, accuracy etc. Client contributions are assessed with respect to improving this utility.  

- Participating and non-participating clients: In each training epoch, only a subset of clients participate. The framework assesses contributions of both participating and non-participating clients.

- History-aware contribution: The framework aggregates Shapley values across epochs to determine a historical timeline of contributions as training progresses.

- Scheduling procedure: A optimization strategy to select a subset of epochs to compute expensive Shapley values under a computational budget, while ensuring fairness.

- Client intention analysis: Analyzing the historical contributions of clients to detect anomalies like dishonest clients intentionally poisoning data.

In summary, the key focus is on developing a game-theoretic, history-aware framework called FLContrib to assess client contributions in federated learning, which also facilitates analysis of client behaviors.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed framework {\framework} theoretically justify the assessment of client contributions for both participating and non-participating clients in each epoch of federated learning? What properties of Shapley value does it leverage?

2. Explain the key intuition behind using the incremental utilities between consecutive epochs to compute the Shapley values in {\framework}. Why is this more suitable for the Markovian training process of federated learning?

3. The paper discusses both exact and approximate methods for computing Shapley values within {\framework}. Compare and contrast the computational complexity trade-offs between these two approaches. When would you choose one over the other?

4. What are the key factors considered in the optimization problem for the scheduling procedure to determine which epochs to compute Shapley values? Explain the difference between server-sided and client-sided fairness. 

5. How does the lower bound formulation for two-sided fairness differ from the original mixed integer linear program? What are the trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency?

6. Discuss the limitations of existing methods such as ComFedSV, GTG-Shapley and TMR in assessing client contributions. How does the proposed {\framework} aim to address them?

7. The modular design of {\framework} is highlighted as one of its strengths. Explain how different Shapley value approximation algorithms could be integrated and their effects.

8. Analyze the empirical results demonstrating the comparative performance of {\framework} against other methods in terms of computational time and estimation error. What key insights do you draw?

9. Explain the application of using historic Shapley values from {\framework} to detect poisoning attacks by dishonest clients. How does change point detection and clustering help identify them?

10. What open research problems remain in assessing client contributions in federated learning? Discuss how the design principles and analysis from {\framework} could guide future work.
