# [Don't Forget What I did?: Assessing Client Contributions in Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07151)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Fair and accurate assessment of client contributions is an important problem in Federated Learning (FL) where multiple clients collaboratively train a machine learning model without exposing private data. Existing methods rely on simplified assumptions such as all clients participating in every training epoch. The paper studies the problem of assessing client contributions in FL when only a subset of clients participate in each training epoch.

Proposed Solution - FLContrib Framework:
The paper proposes FLContrib, a history-aware game-theoretic framework to assess client contributions using Shapley values. The key ideas are:

1. Compute Shapley values per-epoch based on incremental model utility gain to account for the sequential training process in FL.

2. Aggregate per-epoch Shapley values over all epochs to obtain history-aware overall contributions. This allows assessing contributions of both participating and non-participating clients.

3. Propose a scheduling algorithm to selectively compute expensive Shapley values over epochs based on computational budget, while optimizing for fairness and model utility coverage.

Main Contributions:

1. A theoretically-grounded framework to provide exact client contributions in FL with partial client participation per epoch by leveraging properties of Shapley values.

2. Accuracy-efficiency trade-off by approximate Shapley computation and optimal scheduling over epochs based on incremental model gain and client participation fairness.

3. Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrating computational efficiency and accuracy in estimated contributions compared to state-of-the-art methods. Also demonstrates application in detecting dishonest clients from history of contributions.

The framework provides a flexible and theoretically sound approach for history-aware assessment of client contributions applicable to incentive allocation and security mechanisms in federated learning.
