# ChatHaruhi: Reviving Anime Character in Reality via Large Language Model

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: Can natural language models effectively mimic the conversational style and knowledge of specific fictional characters during dialogues? The key hypothesis is that by providing appropriate system prompts and extracting example dialogues of the characters from original scripts as memories, language models can be controlled to role-play as distinctive personas. The paper proposes techniques to implement this idea and constructs the ChatHaruhi system and dataset to demonstrate its feasibility.In summary, the core research question is whether language models can be made to convincingly role-play as anime, TV or other fictional characters by incorporating prompts and character memories. The central hypothesis is that this approach can enable mimicking both the knowledge and conversational style of specific personas.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:1. Based on large language models, the authors propose a complete role-playing algorithm system. This algorithm can effectively organize a character's memories, allowing language models to mimic the tone and knowledge of specific anime/TV characters during a conversation. 2. The authors construct a role-playing dataset covering 32 different Chinese/English TV/anime characters. By collecting and extracting dialogues from various sources, they have compiled over 22,000 conversational exchanges. Using their proposed algorithm and models like GPT-3, they further simulated over 31,000 dialogues for these characters. This forms the ChatHaruhi-54k dataset.3. To evaluate role-playing chatbots, the authors propose both automatic metrics judging similarity to the original script, and human evaluation metrics assessing the chatbot's alignment to the character and response quality. Results show their approach yields improved role-playing performance compared to baselines.In summary, the key contribution is an algorithm leveraging large language models' abilities that enables mimicking the speaking style and knowledge of specific fictional characters in dialogues. The paper also constructs a dataset and evaluations tailored for this persona-based conversational task.
