# Generative Counterfactual Introspection for Explainable Deep Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we generate counterfactual visual explanations for a deep neural network classifier that provide interpretable and actionable feedback about its decision boundaries?Specifically, the paper proposes a generative counterfactual explanation approach that can produce prototype and criticism examples to elucidate a classifier's behavior. The key ideas are:- Counterfactual explanations identify changes to the input that would lead to a different model output, revealing information about the decision boundaries. - Prototype examples are inputs modified to maximize confidence in the original class, while criticism examples are modified to change the predicted class.- Using generative models like GANs allows creating realistic modifications and provides actionable feedback by editing semantic attributes. - The approach is evaluated on MNIST and CelebA datasets, demonstrating its ability to reveal insights about classifiers, like potential biases.In summary, the main hypothesis is that counterfactual visual explanations generated by editing inputs using generative models can provide interpretable and actionable information about a classifier's decision making. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a generative counterfactual introspection technique for deep neural networks to enable model interpretation. The key ideas are:- Using a generative model to make meaningful edits to the input image in order to answer counterfactual questions, i.e. what changes can be made to the input to alter the prediction. - Generating prototypes and criticisms as two types of counterfactual explanations - prototype being a quintessential sample representing the class, and criticism being a sample from a different class that is closest to the decision boundary.- Leveraging powerful generative models like GANs along with attribute editing mechanisms to generate interpretable and actionable counterfactual visual explanations.- Demonstrating how this technique can reveal interesting properties of classifiers, like biases or decision boundaries, on MNIST and CelebA datasets.In summary, the main contribution is developing a generative framework for counterfactual introspection of deep neural networks to provide causal and actionable insights into model behavior. The use of prototypes and criticisms coupled with generative models enables new ways to interpret and explain complex models.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an introspection technique for deep neural networks that uses a generative model to modify the input image in a meaningful way, in order to obtain answers to counterfactual questions about how the input could be changed to alter the model's prediction.
