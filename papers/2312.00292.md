# [SEPSIS: I Can Catch Your Lies -- A New Paradigm for Deception Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores the phenomenon of "lies of omission", a form of deception that has received limited attention compared to "lies of commission". 
- Lies of omission involve deliberately excluding key information, rather than providing false information. 
- The paper draws inspiration from psychology frameworks to categorize lies of omission across four layers - type, color, intention and topic.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the SEPSIS dataset with 876,784 data points annotated across the four layers of lies of omission.
- A novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework is proposed to detect lies of omission, leveraging dataless merging of fine-tuned language models and tailored loss functions.  

Key Contributions:
- Pioneering study on lies of omission, including the introduction of the large-scale SEPSIS dataset.
- MTL pipeline for deception detection reaching 0.87 F1 score by merging fine-tuned models and using specialized loss functions.
- Analysis revealing correlations between lies of omission and propaganda techniques like "loaded language".
- Public release of dataset and models to encourage further research on this impactful societal phenomenon.

In summary, the paper conducts a comprehensive multi-dimensional study of lies of omission, facilitated by the SEPSIS dataset. The high-performance MTL framework shows promising results. Further analysis also uncovers intriguing links between deception and propaganda.
