# [SEPSIS: I Can Catch Your Lies -- A New Paradigm for Deception Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores the phenomenon of "lies of omission", a form of deception that has received limited attention compared to "lies of commission". 
- Lies of omission involve deliberately excluding key information, rather than providing false information. 
- The paper draws inspiration from psychology frameworks to categorize lies of omission across four layers - type, color, intention and topic.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the SEPSIS dataset with 876,784 data points annotated across the four layers of lies of omission.
- A novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework is proposed to detect lies of omission, leveraging dataless merging of fine-tuned language models and tailored loss functions.  

Key Contributions:
- Pioneering study on lies of omission, including the introduction of the large-scale SEPSIS dataset.
- MTL pipeline for deception detection reaching 0.87 F1 score by merging fine-tuned models and using specialized loss functions.
- Analysis revealing correlations between lies of omission and propaganda techniques like "loaded language".
- Public release of dataset and models to encourage further research on this impactful societal phenomenon.

In summary, the paper conducts a comprehensive multi-dimensional study of lies of omission, facilitated by the SEPSIS dataset. The high-performance MTL framework shows promising results. Further analysis also uncovers intriguing links between deception and propaganda.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper introduces a new multilayered corpus called SEPSIS for studying lies of omission, proposes a multi-task learning framework using fine-tuned language models and tailored loss functions to detect different types of deception, and analyzes the relationship between lies of omission and propaganda techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It presents a pioneering study on the phenomenon of lies of omission. 

2) It introduces the SEPSIS corpus and associated resources. The SEPSIS corpus contains 876,784 data points with four layers of annotation: type, color, intention, and topic of lies.

3) It introduces a multi-task learning (MTL) pipeline for SEPSIS classification that leverages the dataless merging of fine-tuned language models and incorporates tailored loss functions for each layer.

4) It reveals a significant correlation between deception and propaganda techniques through an analysis using the SEPSIS framework.

In summary, the key contributions are the introduction of the SEPSIS corpus focused on lies of omission, an MTL pipeline for deception detection leveraging this dataset, and an analysis connecting deception and propaganda.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Lies of omission - The main focus of the paper is on lies of omission, which involve deliberately leaving out key information to deceive others. This is a form of deception studied from a psychological perspective.

- SEPSIS dataset - A novel dataset introduced in the paper with 876,784 data points. It has multiple layers of annotations categorizing different aspects of lies of omission.  

- Multi-task learning (MTL) - The method used to develop a classifier for categorizing the different types of lies of omission in the SEPSIS dataset. Uses fine-tuned language models merged in a dataless approach.

- Propaganda techniques - The paper explores the relationship between lies of omission and common propaganda techniques. Reveals correlations between certain techniques and deception categories.

- Type, color, intent, topic - Refers to the different annotation layers in the SEPSIS dataset categorizing lies of omission by type, color (level of harm), intent, and topic.

So in summary, the key focus is on using multi-task learning and a novel multilayered deception dataset to uncover insights into lies of omission and propaganda.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel multi-task learning pipeline for deception detection. What is the rationale behind using a multi-task learning approach instead of separate models for each deception detection task? How does leveraging shared representations across related tasks lead to better performance?

2. The multi-task learning pipeline utilizes dataless merging of fine-tuned language models. Why is model fine-tuning an important step before the merging process? How does fine-tuning enhance the performance of language models on domain-specific data? 

3. The paper explores various loss functions like cross-entropy loss, focal loss, dice loss and distribution-balanced loss for the multi-task heads. What considerations went into selecting an appropriate loss function for each task head? How do factors like class imbalance influence this decision?

4. What is the motivation behind using 5W (Who, What, When, Where, Why) based semantic role labeling and slot filling for synthetic data augmentation? How does masking and replacing the 5Ws help generate variations modeling lies of omission?  

5. The paper reveals significant correlations between various propaganda techniques and different deception layers like type, color and intent of lies. What analysis was performed to uncover these relationships? How can these findings further the understanding of deception?

6. The multi-task model utilizes Transformer based encoders for converting text to latent embeddings before the task-specific heads. Why are attention-based architectures suitable for encoding textual data? What advantages do they offer over RNN based architectures?

7. How was the performance of paraphrasing models like Pegasus, T5 and GPT-3 evaluated along the dimensions of coverage, correctness and diversity? What results motivated the final selection of GPT-3 for paraphrasing?

8. What accommodations were made during the annotation process to account for the multi-class, multi-label nature of the deception detection tasks? How was consolidation of annotations from multiple annotators handled?  

9. Why is the phenomenon of lies of omission relatively less studied compared to lies of commission? What novel insights does the investigation of lies of omission in this paper offer?

10. The paper introduces an elaborate, layered annotation schema encompassing type, color, intent and topic of lies. What psychological theories or prior deception research motivated this annotation strategy? How is it tailored to model lies of omission?
