# [SEPSIS: I Can Catch Your Lies -- A New Paradigm for Deception Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00292)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces SEPSIS, a novel multi-layered corpus focused on investigating lies of omission. The authors curated a large-scale dataset spanning 876,784 data points by amalgamating fake news data and news headlines. Each data point has been annotated across four layers capturing the type, color, intent, and topic of deception. The authors propose an MTL framework incorporating dataless merging of fine-tuned language models and introduce tailored loss functions for each task. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance. Finally, an extensive analysis reveals compelling relationships between propaganda techniques and lies of omission. Overall, this pioneering study on lies of omission introduces the SEPSIS corpus, an MTL framework leveraging advances in LM fine-tuning, and uncovers associations between deception and propaganda - contributing significantly to the field through data, models, and insights.
