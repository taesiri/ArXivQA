# [ReLU$^2$ Wins: Discovering Efficient Activation Functions for Sparse   LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) with ReLU activation exhibit sparse activation, where many neurons have zero output. This enables efficient sparse computation by skipping inactive neurons. 
- However, it's unclear if non-ReLU LLMs also exhibit sparse activation, and which activation function is optimal for sparse LLMs. 

Proposed Solution:
- They generalize the definition of sparse activation beyond zero outputs to small magnitude outputs using a magnitude threshold.
- They show non-ReLU LLaMA models also exhibit a long-tail distribution of neuron magnitudes, indicating sparse activation. 
- To find the optimal activation function, they systematically compare ReLU, SwiGLU, ReGLU, and ReLU^2 based on:
   - Sparsity-performance tradeoff: ReLU^2 achieves best tradeoff, with <0.1% performance loss at ~90% sparsity
   - Predictivity: Ability to predict inactive neurons. ReLU and ReLU^2 have highest predictivity.
   - Hardware affinity: ReLU and ReLU^2 better exploit locality between tokens and neurons to reduce I/O.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate sparse activation in non-ReLU LLMs by analyzing neuron magnitudes 
- Propose magnitude threshold based method to quantify sparse activation
- Systematic framework to evaluate activation functions for sparse LLMs
- Show ReLU^2 activation function is most efficient for sparse computation of LLMs, based on sparsity, predictivity and hardware affinity.

The paper provides a new perspective on sparse computation beyond ReLU, and shows ReLU^2 is an promising activation function to build sparse and efficient LLMs. The proposed analysis framework can guide future work on efficient LLM designs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a general method to define neuron activation based on output magnitudes, finds non-ReLU LLMs also exhibit sparse activation, and shows ReLU$^2$ achieves the best trade-off between performance and sparsity as well as highest predictivity and hardware affinity, making it the most efficient activation function for sparse large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a more general definition of activation sparsity based on neuron output magnitudes rather than solely focusing on zero activation values. This allows capturing sparse activation in non-ReLU LLMs.

2. It systematically examines different activation functions from three key aspects for sparse LLM deployment - the trade-off between sparsity and performance, sparsity predictivity, and hardware affinity. 

3. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs with different activation functions, it demonstrates that ReLU^2 activation function excels across all three evaluation aspects. Specifically, ReLU^2-based LLM achieves the best trade-off between performance and sparsity, highest neuron activation predictivity, and better hardware affinity compared to LLM models with other activation functions.

4. The findings highlight the potential of ReLU^2 as an efficient activation function to build sparse LLMs that can be efficiently deployed in low-resource scenarios.

In summary, the key contribution is a thorough investigation and comparison of different activation functions for sparse LLM deployment, with results demonstrating ReLU^2 as the most efficient activation. The proposed methodologies to evaluate sparsity provide a systematic framework for future research on efficient sparse LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new general definition of activation sparsity based on neuron output magnitudes rather than solely zero activations. What are the theoretical justifications behind this new definition? How does it align with or differ from neurological evidence on neuron firing patterns?

2. The paper examines activation functions from three key aspects - sparsity vs performance tradeoff, predictivity, and hardware affinity. Are there any other equally important evaluation criteria that could have been considered in the analysis? What are some alternatives and how might they have impacted the results?

3. ReLU^2 is identified as the most efficient activation function. However, the paper also notes that SwiGLU models exhibit better performance. What architectural or optimization changes could help close this performance gap while retaining computational efficiency? 

4. The analysis relies primarily on 1.3B parameter models. Would the relative trends and conclusions hold for models with over 100B parameters? What differences might emerge at larger scale in terms of sparsity patterns?  

5. The paper utilizes a two-layer neural network as the activation predictor. What alternative predictor architectures were considered or could be explored? Would techniques like self-attention provide benefits?

6. How exactly were the hardware affinity metrics calculated and evaluated? What are the real-world implications in terms of potential speedups and efficiency gains on modern accelerator hardware?

7. ReLU^2 shows higher activation sparsity for the same cumulative error compared to ReLU. What accounts for this? Is it an inherent mathematical property of the activation function?

8. For hardware optimization, the paper proposes grouping highly co-activated neurons. What specific techniques could be used to implement this in practice while minimizing overheads?

9. What are the practical challenges in incorporating customized sparse activation functions like ReLU^2 into existing deep learning frameworks and model architectures?

10. What other follow-up experiments could provide further evidence and insights into the efficiency of ReLU^2 and the proposed sparse activation techniques? Are there any potential negative results to investigate?
