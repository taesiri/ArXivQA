# [Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detector Using Global-Local Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) are vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs) using inexpensive materials like silicone, latex, etc. This affects the security of these systems.
- Existing presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have limitations like information loss, poor generalization ability across materials and sensors. They fail when new types of attacks or sensors are introduced.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a PAD method called RTK-PAD using a global-local model and a rethinking strategy.
- It has three main modules - global PAD, local PAD and rethinking module.
- The global PAD module takes the entire fingerprint image as input and predicts a global spoofness score. It uses a Cut-out based pretext task to learn non-local features.
- The local PAD module takes cropped local patches as input and predicts local spoofness scores. It uses a texture in-painting based pretext task to learn local features.
- The core rethinking module connects the global and local modules. It localizes discriminative patches based on the global module's predictions. These patches are fed to the local module.

Main Contributions:
- A novel rethinking strategy is proposed to effectively fuse the global and local modules by finding important local regions in a top-down manner.
- Flexible pretext tasks like Cut-out and texture in-painting are used to guide the modules to learn contrastive global and local features. 
- Experiments on LivDet 2017 dataset show state-of-the-art performance:
   - 45% lower error rate and 12.9% higher TDR compared to previous best method
   - Much better generalization across materials and sensors
- The method does not require additional hardware or data from unseen sensors/materials.

In summary, the paper presents a PAD method using a global-local model and rethinking strategy that shows significantly improved accuracy and generalization ability over state-of-the-art techniques. The pretext tasks and rethinking module enable learning complementary global and local features from fingerprint images.
