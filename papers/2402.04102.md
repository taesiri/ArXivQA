# [Use of Multi-CNNs for Section Analysis in Static Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing malware detection research focuses mainly on improving detection rates, but provides limited explainability or actionable information for analysts. The authors argue that it is also important to understand why a file is classified as malware, and identify suspicious areas in the file to help guide investigation. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new model to analyze Portable Executable (PE) files by splitting them into sections, transforming each section into an image, and using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze each section. This provides per-section scores that are combined into an overall malware score. The model aims to improve detection rates while also indicating the most suspicious sections to help analysts.

Key Contributions:

- Transforms PE file sections into images and trains a CNN per section 
- Combines CNN section scores into overall malware score with scoring functions like XGBoost
- Achieves 1.5% higher accuracy over baseline model on malware detection
- Provides per-section scores to highlight suspicious areas and explain results
- Uses feature importance measures to identify most influential sections (.idata and .rsrc)
- Modular architecture allows adding sections easily to quantify impact

The multi-CNN model provides improved accuracy, explainability of results, and actionable information to help guide investigation. The modular design also makes it easy to add or customize sections to further improve performance. Key benefits are explaining detection scores and highlighting suspicious file sections to analysts.
