# [On the Safety Concerns of Deploying LLMs/VLMs in Robotics: Highlighting   the Risks and Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10340)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent works have integrated large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) into robotics to enhance performance on tasks like manipulation and navigation. However, this integration introduces significant vulnerabilities due to the susceptibility of language models to adversarial attacks, which can lead to catastrophic consequences in robotic systems.

- LLMs/VLMs have inherent issues like susceptibility to hallucination/illusion and inability to address ambiguity in contextual information that can negatively impact reliable scene understanding and lead to undesired robot actions. Their reliance on template-based prompts also contributes to misunderstandings due to lack of flexibility in handling natural language variants/synonyms.  

- Incorporating multi-modality increases context understanding difficulty and reasoning complexity, raising failure risks. These risks pose major robustness and safety challenges for real-world LLM/VLM-robot applications.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors categorize two main vulnerabilities that facilitate low-cost adversarial attacks by simply modifying inputs: (1) Prompt inputs, due to their template-based and keyword-dependent nature (2) Visual inputs, where even simple image manipulations can disrupt object localization and scene understanding.

- Three attack categories are proposed: Prompt attack - rephrases prompts to challenge interpretation; Perception attack - modifies visual observations; Mixture attack - combines prompt and perception attacks. Detailed definitions and examples are provided for various methods under each category.

- Experiments apply these attacks on three state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-robot approaches - KnowNo, VIMA and Instruct2Act. Evaluations across manipulation and rearrangement tasks demonstrate significant performance deterioration, with average success rate drops of 21.2% under prompt attacks and a more severe 30.2% under perception attacks.

Main Contributions:
- First work to specifically address and demonstrate vulnerabilities in LLM/VLM-based robot systems to adversarial attacks, highlighting safety concerns.  

- Outlines and categorizes various adversarial attacks on LLM/VLM-robot integrated systems into prompt and perception attacks with detailed definitions and examples.

- Extensive experiments and analysis quantifying attack impacts across tasks and models, revealing ease of compromising state-of-the-art approaches via simple input manipulations.

- Highlights open issues for the research community regarding robustness, reliability and safe integration of language models into robotics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

(1) Highlighting the vulnerabilities and safety concerns of using LLMs/VLMs in robotics through an extensive literature review and in-depth analysis of their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. The authors state this is the first work to specifically address and discuss vulnerabilities in an LLM/VLM-based robot system.

(2) Designing and categorizing adversarial attacks on LLM/VLM-robot integrated systems, classifying them into prompt and perception attacks. For each attack category, outlining various potential attack methods along with detailed definitions and examples. 

(3) Conducting empirical analysis by applying the adversarial attacks across all categories on three state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-robot approaches. Showing the attacks deteriorate the success rate of the systems by an average of 21.2% under prompt attacks and 30.2% under perception attacks for manipulation tasks.

(4) Highlighting key open questions that need to be addressed by the research community for the safe, robust, and reliable deployment of language models in robotics.
