# [CogView3: Finer and Faster Text-to-Image Generation via Relay Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Existing text-to-image diffusion models operate in a single stage at high resolutions (e.g. 1024x1024), which is computationally expensive during training and inference. 
- Prior cascaded diffusion frameworks require complex augmentation techniques to bridge the gap between lower and higher resolution stages.
- Diffusion model distillation techniques often compromise too much on generation quality in order to reduce inference cost.

Proposed Solution - CogView3:
- First text-to-image generation system based on a new framework called "relay diffusion", which decomposes the generation process into a base stage followed by iterative relaying super-resolution stages.  
- In the relaying super-resolution stage, Gaussian noise is added to the upsampled lower resolution images from the previous stage before starting diffusion from them. This allows the model to potentially rectify unsatisfactory artifacts.
- Implement relay diffusion in the latent space using a simplified linear blurring schedule between lower and higher resolution latent representations.
- Further explore progressive distillation of the cascaded relay diffusion model to greatly reduce inference time while preserving quality.

Main Contributions:
- CogView3 with relay diffusion achieves state-of-the-art text-to-image generation quality with up to 77% win rate over current models, while requiring only about half the inference time.
- Able to generate high quality 2048x2048 images through iterative super-resolution stages.  
- Distilled variant achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while using only 1/10th of the inference time.
- Relaying design and distillation makes diffusion model scale to higher resolutions easier compared to single-stage models.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative relay diffusion framework for text-to-image generation that achieves better quality with lower inference cost through its cascaded generation pipeline.
