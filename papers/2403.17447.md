# [Chain of Compression: A Systematic Approach to Combinationally Compress   Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks have high computational and memory costs, making deployment difficult on resource-constrained devices. 
- Many compression techniques exist (pruning, quantization, distillation, early exit) but little research explores interactions and optimal sequencing when combining them.

Proposed Solution - Chain of Compression:
- Treat each compression technique as a modular building block that can be chained together. 
- Systematically explore interactions and sequencing between pairs of techniques. Find consistent optimal ordering.
- Show that adding a 3rd technique does not affect established optimal 2-technique ordering.  
- Use topological sorting across directed acyclic graph of pairwise orderings to derive optimal sequence for multiple techniques: distillation → pruning → quantization → early exit.

Main Contributions:
- Combing compression techniques has complementary benefits, with the whole being greater than the sum of parts.
- Order matters significantly. Consistent optimal ordering found between pairs suggests a route to optimal sequence. 
- Optimal sequence derived: static to dynamic, large to small granularity.
- Full chain of optimal compression achieves 100-1000x compression, with minimal accuracy loss.

In summary, the key innovation is a systematic methodology to explore interactions and sequencing between compression techniques. This builds up strong evidence towards an optimal combination sequence that maximally compresses deep neural networks for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
