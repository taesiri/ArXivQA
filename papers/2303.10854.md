# [Dynamic Documentation for AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10854)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop more dynamic and holistic documentation protocols for AI systems that go beyond the limitations of current static approaches like Model Cards or high-level algorithmic impact assessments?The authors argue that current documentation approaches for AI systems tend to be either too granular and static (like Model Cards) or too high-level without enough technical specificity (like some algorithmic impact assessments). They advocate for a new paradigm of "dynamic documentation" that can continuously track and update understanding of how complex AI systems behave in deployment based on feedback and iterative changes. The key components proposed for dynamic documentation include standardized user feedback metrics, regular updating of technical implementation details, and interfaces to translate user interactions into actionable documentation. Overall, the paper is making the case that new forms of documentation are needed to properly understand, evaluate and regulate increasingly complex AI systems over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is arguing for the need for "dynamic documentation" of AI systems. The key points are:- It reviews the history and limitations of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) as a model for documentation outside of AI. - It critiques current AI documentation approaches like Model Cards and algorithmic impact assessments in Canada and China for being too static or abstract. - It proposes that documentation should focus on the "rewards" and iterative decision-making in AI systems, like Reward Reports aim to do. - It argues that a documentation system needs to continuously monitor system performance on standardized metrics through user feedback interfaces. This would enable truly "dynamic documentation".In summary, the paper makes the case that current AI documentation methods are insufficient and a new paradigm focused on the feedback-driven nature of AI systems is needed. The main contribution is outlining the components and rationale for "dynamic documentation" as a better way to understand, evaluate, and regulate AI systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper argues that current AI documentation protocols are limited in their ability to fully capture the dynamic behaviors of complex AI systems, and proposes a new framework of "dynamic documentation" that continuously monitors system performance through standardized metrics and interfaces for user feedback.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on AI documentation:- It provides a more comprehensive historical context by looking at the origins and evolution of Environmental Impact Statements. Many papers on AI documentation focus narrowly on recent tools like Model Cards without considering parallels in other fields. - The analysis of current documentation approaches like Model Cards and algorithmic impact assessments is quite thorough. The paper points out specific limitations and gaps rather than making general critiques. This level of detail is uncommon.- Linking documentation to the dynamics and iterative nature of AI systems is an innovative perspective. The idea of "dynamic documentation" and using concepts from reinforcement learning is novel compared to most research that views documentation in a static way. - The proposal to standardize metrics for system evaluation (like HELM for language models) and interface them with documentation protocols is creative. Most papers stop at critiques without offering concrete technical solutions.- The writing is clear and structured nicely to trace the progression of documentation historically, assess current techniques, and build up the case for dynamic documentation using concrete examples. Many papers in this emerging field are less focused.Overall, this paper stands out for its interdisciplinary approach, attention to technical details, and novel proposals like dynamic documentation. The combination of historical context, thoughtful analysis, and technical recommendations makes a valuable contribution compared to related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Developing a fully dynamic documentation system for AI that can continuously monitor system performance on key metrics over time. The authors argue that the goal of AI documentation should be to take "continuous snapshots" of a system's performance, similar to how Model Cards provide a rich picture of a model's biases and behavior at a single point in time. - Creating standardized benchmarks and metrics to systematically process diverse modes of user interaction and feedback. The authors point to the HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) benchmarks as an example that reduces varied user comments into standardized metrics that a general documentation system could incorporate.- Designing interfaces to collect and categorize user feedback in a structured way, along the dimensions captured by metrics like HELM. This curated feedback could then inform regular iterations of documentation frameworks like Reward Reports.- Exploring ways to dynamically link Reward Reports to user interactions, so that documentation evolves as the system interacts with the world. - Developing creative technical solutions to handle the sheer volume of user feedback and enable true accountability, learning from the challenges faced in processing public comments for Environmental Impact Statements.In summary, the authors call for documentation that is dynamic, standardized, and interfaces tightly with real-world system deployment to facilitate continuous monitoring, reflection and improvement of AI systems. Their suggestions focus on making documentation more holistic, adaptive and grounded in feedback from actual usage.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper argues that current AI documentation protocols are insufficient for understanding and evaluating increasingly complex AI systems. It traces the history of documentation in environmental impact statements, which faced limitations such as incremental decision-making and poor assessment of social impacts. The paper then examines modern AI documentation tools like Model Cards and algorithmic impact assessments, showing how they fail to capture the dynamic, feedback-driven nature of AI systems. It proposes that documentation should center the rewards/objectives set by designers and utilize standardized metrics applied to user feedback over time. This "dynamic documentation" approach could build off frameworks like Reward Reports, interfacing them with user comments processed through benchmarks like HELM to enable continuous monitoring of AI system performance. Overall, the paper makes the case that truly "dynamic documentation" focused on system objectives, metrics, and user feedback is essential for accountability in AI.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper argues that current documentation protocols for AI systems are insufficient and proposes a new paradigm called "dynamic documentation." The paper first reviews approaches to system documentation outside AI, focusing on Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) in the US. It finds that EISs struggled to provide holistic understanding of project impacts due to their incremental nature. The paper then examines current AI documentation tools like Model Cards and algorithmic impact assessments, finding they are either too granular or too abstract to properly evaluate complex, feedback-driven systems like large language models. The paper proposes that AI documentation should center the system's rewards and feedback loops, like a Reward Report does. However, Reward Reports lack continuous monitoring of system changes over time. The paper concludes by arguing that ideal dynamic documentation would combine standardized performance metrics derived from user feedback with a framework logging system changes over time.In summary, this paper critiques current AI documentation tools as either too static or too high-level. It argues for "dynamic documentation" that continuously tracks system performance on standardized metrics derived from user feedback. This would provide a more holistic, temporally-aware understanding of AI system impacts.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper argues for the need for dynamic documentation of AI systems, which involves continuous monitoring and updating of system performance and impacts over time. It outlines the limitations of current documentation approaches like Model Cards and algorithmic impact assessments, which provide static snapshots of system performance or abstracted accounts of system impacts. The paper proposes that documentation should focus on examining the evaluative criteria, objectives, and rewards set by designers as well as how feedback is utilized, similar to reinforcement learning. It suggests Reward Reports as one framework to document these aspects continuously across iterations, along with standardized metrics like HELM to process diverse user feedback into performance benchmarks that can be reflected in dynamic documentation. Overall, the main method advocated is documentation that iteratively tracks an AI system's performance on key metrics derived from user interactions and feedback.
