# [Online Continual Learning Without the Storage Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09253)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we perform online continual learning without storage constraints, emphasizing economical computation budgets instead?The key hypothesis is that by removing storage constraints and storing all past data, a simple nearest neighbor-based approach can outperform existing online continual learning methods that operate under tighter storage budgets. The paper argues that with dropping storage costs, storing all past data is feasible as long as computational costs are controlled. It proposes an adaptive memory system based on k-nearest neighbors that can store all past data and operate under a logarithmic computational budget. The hypothesis is that this simple approach will enable rapid adaptation and avoid catastrophic forgetting, outperforming existing online continual learning methods.In summary, the main research question is how to do online continual learning without storage constraints, and the hypothesis is that a nearest neighbor-based system can work better than existing approaches by exploiting the ability to store all past data. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis.
