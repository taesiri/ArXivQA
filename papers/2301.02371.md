# [Anchor3DLane: Learning to Regress 3D Anchors for Monocular 3D Lane   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02371)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we accurately detect 3D lanes from monocular camera images in an end-to-end manner without relying on bird's eye view transformation?The key points are:- The paper aims to tackle the challenging task of monocular 3D lane detection, where lack of depth information makes it difficult to estimate lanes in 3D space from 2D images. - Existing methods typically transform images or features to bird's eye view (BEV) via inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to simplify the problem. However, IPM relies on flat ground assumption and loses useful context information above the road surface.- The paper proposes a new framework called Anchor3DLane that regresses 3D lanes directly from front-view (FV) images/features, without introducing BEV representation.- The key idea is to define 3D lane anchors in 3D space and project them into FV features to extract anchor features for prediction. This retains richer context and helps estimate 3D lanes accurately.- Experiments show Anchor3DLane outperforms previous BEV-based methods on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness for monocular 3D lane detection in an end-to-end manner without BEV transformation.In summary, the main research question is how to perform accurate monocular 3D lane detection without relying on BEV, and the paper proposes the Anchor3DLane framework as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this CVPR 2023 paper are:- It proposes a new framework called Anchor3DLane for monocular 3D lane detection. This framework directly defines anchors in 3D space and regresses 3D lanes from front-view (FV) features without needing to transform into bird's-eye-view (BEV). - It projects the 3D anchors into FV space to sample features, retaining both good structural and context information for accurate prediction. This avoids the information loss of inverse perspective mapping used in prior BEV-based methods.- It extends the framework to leverage temporal information from adjacent frames by projecting 3D anchors using camera poses. This further improves performance over single-frame prediction.- It develops a global optimization method using the equal-width property between lane lines to refine predictions, reducing lateral error especially for distant parts.- Without bells and whistles, Anchor3DLane outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets for monocular 3D lane detection.In summary, the key innovation is defining 3D anchors to bridge the gap between FV and 3D space directly, avoiding the need for BEV transformation. This results in a simple yet effective framework for monocular 3D lane detection. The code is available on GitHub.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Anchor3DLane, a new method for monocular 3D lane detection that defines anchors directly in 3D space rather than using a bird's eye view representation, and samples front view features for these anchors to predict 3D lane coordinates and visibility more accurately without relying on inverse perspective mapping.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other research in the field of monocular 3D lane detection:- The paper proposes a new BEV-free method called Anchor3DLane that directly predicts 3D lanes from front-view images without transforming features into bird's eye view. This is different from many previous works like 3DLaneNet, GenLaneNet, and PersFormer that rely on bird's eye view feature transformation. - A key novelty is the idea of defining 3D lane anchors directly in 3D space and projecting them into front-view features for prediction. This allows retaining more useful context information compared to warping into BEV.- The paper shows competitive or state-of-the-art results on major 3D lane detection benchmarks like ApolloSim, OpenLane, and ONCE-3DLanes. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.- Compared to some previous works, Anchor3DLane seems to achieve notably better performance on challenging cases like uphill/downhill roads where the flat ground assumption of BEV methods is violated.- The proposed global optimization using equal lane width constraint is simple but helps refine predictions, especially for distant lane parts. This is a nice add-on.- Unlike some methods relying on multi-sensor data, Anchor3DLane only uses monocular images, making it more practical. The multi-frame extension also boosts performance without extra annotation cost.- The ablation studies provide useful insights, like sampling from front-view vs BEV features, impact of iterative regression, etc. - With a lightweight backbone like ResNet-18, Anchor3DLane achieves efficient inference while outperforming heavier models like PersFormer. Adapting to stronger backbones further improves performance.Overall, I think Anchor3DLane makes solid contributions through the novel 3D anchor formulation and front-view prediction approach. The results demonstrate its effectiveness especially for challenging cases. It's a meaningful step forward for monocular 3D lane detection.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring more complex 3D lane settings like multi-view or multi-frame with the Anchor3DLane framework. The authors state their method can be easily extended to these settings by projecting 3D anchors to multiple frames using camera poses.- Incorporating semantic segmentation to provide additional scene understanding and context, which could further improve 3D lane estimation. - Applying the equal-width constraint and optimization not just as a post-processing step but jointly during network training for end-to-end refinement. - Evaluating the impact of stronger backbone networks like EfficientNets on the performance of Anchor3DLane. The authors show some initial experiments indicating their method adapts well to stronger backbones.- Extending the global optimization to utilize other geometric properties besides the equal-width assumption, such as lane curvature, to further refine predictions.- Exploring uncertainty estimation for the 3D lane predictions to enable safety-critical applications.- Applying Anchor3DLane to related tasks like 3D free space estimation and 3D trajectory prediction.In summary, the main future directions focus on extending Anchor3DLane to more complex settings, incorporating additional context information, jointly optimizing constraints during training, using stronger networks, and applying the approach to related tasks. The authors lay out Anchor3DLane as a general 3D lane representation framework amenable to many future improvements.
