# [On the Optimal Memorization Power of ReLU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03187v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research question addressed in this paper is: What is the minimal number of parameters required for a neural network to perfectly memorize a dataset of N labeled points?Specifically, the authors are interested in understanding the memorization capacity of feedforward ReLU neural networks. They want to construct networks that can memorize any dataset of N labeled points, while using the smallest possible number of parameters. The paper shows that a ReLU network with Õ(√N) parameters (where Õ hides logarithmic factors) can memorize any dataset of N separable points. This matches known lower bounds on the memorization capacity up to logarithmic factors, implying the construction is nearly optimal.The paper also studies how limiting the depth of the network affects memorization capacity, as well as the impact of restricting the bit precision of weights. Overall, the central focus is on characterizing and achieving minimal memorization complexity for neural networks. The constructions aim to prove tight upper bounds on the number of parameters needed for perfect memorization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper studies the memorization power of feedforward ReLU neural networks. The main contributions are:- It shows that ReLU networks can memorize any $N$ data points that satisfy a mild separability assumption using only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N})$ parameters. This matches known VC dimension lower bounds up to logarithmic factors, and hence the construction is optimal. - It gives a generalized construction for ReLU networks with depth bounded by $1 \leq L \leq \sqrt{N}$, that can memorize $N$ samples using $\tilde{O}(N/L)$ parameters. This is also optimal compared to VC dimension bounds, up to logarithmic factors.- It proves that having large bit complexity (i.e., large weight magnitudes) is both necessary and sufficient for memorization using a sub-linear number of parameters. The paper shows nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the required bit complexity.- The constructions demonstrate that deep networks have significantly more memorization power compared to shallow networks, and that up to logarithmic factors, memorizing any dataset of size $N$ is not harder than shattering a single dataset of size $N$.In summary, the paper provides an optimal construction and nearly tight analysis for the memorization capacity of ReLU networks. It shows that depth and large weight magnitudes are key to achieving strong memorization guarantees using a minimal number of parameters.
