# [TabMT: Generating tabular data with masked transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06089)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TabMT, a novel Masked Transformer model for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data. TabMT leverages bidirectional masked language modeling to effectively capture complex dependencies and patterns within heterogeneous tabular data. Through comprehensive experiments, TabMT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of tabular datasets and metrics. Key advantages of TabMT include superior scalability from small to massive datasets, built-in handling of missing data, tunable privacy-utility tradeoffs, and high sample quality and diversity. The method is evaluated on privacy preservation, where it shows improved privacy over prior state-of-the-art, as well as on sample quality using a robust classifier-based metric, where it matches or exceeds previous methods on nearly all tested datasets. Additional experiments highlight TabMT's ability to scale to datasets orders of magnitude larger than prior work. The proposed model thus makes notable progress towards a robust and versatile tabular data generator through the cross-domain application of masked language modeling.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality synthetic tabular data is important for applications like data augmentation, privacy preservation, model interpretability, and anomaly detection. However, the heterogeneous and complex nature of tabular data makes this challenging.
- Prior generative models like GANs, VAEs, autoregressive transformers, and diffusion models have limitations in robustness, scalability, handling missing data, and controlling the privacy-quality tradeoff.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes TabMT, a novel Masked Transformer model tailored for tabular data generation.
- TabMT uses an improved masking procedure during training that helps it learn bidirectional patterns, handle missing data, and generate arbitrary prompts/conditions. 
- Ordered embeddings are used to capture ordering in continuous features. Learned temperatures sharpen distributions without instability.
- TabMT can trade off privacy vs quality by tuning a temperature parameter, unlike prior models where this is fixed after training.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art tabular data generation quality across 15 datasets of varying sizes and metrics like ML Efficiency.
- Scales successfully from small datasets of 400 rows to large datasets of 30M rows.
- Natively handles missing data and produces high quality samples.
- Provides superior privacy control via Pareto-optimal temperature tuning and achieves higher privacy than prior models.
- Is robust enough to work across diverse tasks and datasets compared to specialized models like Netflow generators.

In summary, TabMT pushes state-of-the-art in tabular data generation through innovations like improved masking and temperature tuning, while demonstrating scalability, missing data support, and tunable privacy-quality tradeoffs.
