# [AI enhanced data assimilation and uncertainty quantification applied to   Geological Carbon Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06110)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper introduces novel methods for improving uncertainty quantification in geological carbon storage (GCS) projects by integrating machine learning (ML) and data assimilation (DA) techniques. 

The problem addressed is that robust uncertainty quantification is critical for GCS projects but faces challenges due to geological complexities and nonlinear fluid dynamics. Traditional DA methods can be computationally prohibitive. The paper proposes two solutions:

1) Surrogate-based Hybrid ESMDA (SH-ESMDA): This incorporates ML surrogate models into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA) method. Specifically, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and Transformer UNets are evaluated as surrogates. Using the surrogates accelerates the ESMDA computations by over 50\% while maintaining accuracy.

2) Surrogate-based Hybrid RML (SH-RML): This enables variational DA by leveraging automatic differentiation from the ML surrogates to compute gradients for the Randomized Maximum Likelihood (RML) optimization. The high-fidelity physics simulator is still used to compute the final posterior states.  

The key contributions are:

- Evaluation of FNO and Transformer UNet surrogates for GCS modeling. FNOs show better accuracy with limited training data.

- Introduction of SH-ESMDA to accelerate ESMDA through ML surrogates while preserving physical consistency.

- Introduction of SH-RML to enable gradient-based variational DA by using ML surrogate gradients, avoiding manual adjoint derivations.

- Demonstrating SH-RML achieves improved history matching and uncertainty quantification compared to standard ESMDA.

The proposed hybrid methods enhance DA for GCS by integrating ML efficiency and physical reliability. The frameworks show promise for adaptation to diverse subsurface applications in the energy transition.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces and evaluates innovative hybrid data assimilation frameworks that leverage machine learning surrogates to enhance computational efficiency and physics-based models to ensure robustness, demonstrating improved history matching for geological carbon storage applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The evaluation and comparison of two machine learning surrogate models, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and Transformer UNet (T-UNet), for approximating CO2 injection simulations in geological carbon storage. The analysis shows FNOs have a slight advantage over T-UNet when training data is limited.

2) The introduction of two novel hybrid data assimilation frameworks - Surrogate-based hybrid ESMDA (SH-ESMDA) and Surrogate-based Hybrid RML (SH-RML) - that integrate machine learning surrogates into ensemble-based (ESMDA) and variational (RML) data assimilation techniques. 

3) SH-ESMDA incorporates ML surrogates into ESMDA, accelerating computations by over 50% while maintaining accuracy. SH-RML enables variational DA by using automatic differentiation from ML models for gradient calculations in RML optimization, avoiding manual adjoint derivations.

4) Results showing SH-RML achieves improved history matching and uncertainty quantification compared to standard ESMDA. The integration of ML surrogates thus enhances DA for geological carbon storage by combining machine learning efficiency with the physical reliability of reservoir simulators.

In summary, the key contribution is advancing data assimilation for CO2 storage through novel integration of machine learning and physics-based models to improve computational efficiency and quantification of uncertainties.
