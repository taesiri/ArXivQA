## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) aims to accurately recognize sub-categories of objects with near-duplicate appearances (e.g. bird species). A key challenge is exploring subtle yet distinctive features between similar sub-categories. However, most methods focus on designing network structures and ignore assessing the quality of learned visual representations. They also lack effective learning between global semantics and local parts.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Context-Semantic Quality Awareness Network (CSQA-Net) with the following key components:

1) Multi-Level Semantic Quality Evaluation (MLSQE) module to supervise and enhance semantics from different backbone levels. Quality probing classifiers evaluate feature discriminability. 

2) Part Navigator to locate discriminative regions and address scale confusion. 

3) Multi-Part Multi-Scale Cross-Attention (MPMSCA) module to model contextual relationships between global objects and multi-scale parts. It interacts part descriptors with global semantics to capture subtle differences.

Main Contributions:

1) A network evaluating and improving visual representation quality through real-time supervision of hierarchical semantics.

2) Effective weakly-supervised localization of distinctive regions.

3) A cross-attention mechanism exploring multi-scale visual-spatial dependencies between objects and parts.

Experiments on CUB, Cars, Aircraft and NABirds datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of CSQA-Net. Ablations verify the robustness of each proposed component. Visualizations show more accurate localization of discriminative details compared to baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Context-Semantic Quality Awareness Network (CSQA-Net) for fine-grained visual categorization that evaluates the quality of visual representations in real-time and models contextual relationships between global semantics and local discriminative parts across multiple scales to capture subtle inter-class differences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an end-to-end Context-Semantic Quality Awareness Network (CSQA-Net) for fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC). The network explores more detailed part descriptors to regularize global semantics and improves the quality of visual representations through real-time evaluation.

2. It develops a generic multi-level semantic quality evaluation module to progressively supervise and enhance semantics from shallow to deep layers. Novel quality probing classifiers are designed to evaluate the linear separability of visual representations in real-time, thus making the features more discriminative. 

3. For the part branch, it proposes a part navigator to alleviate scale confusion and accurately locate discriminative regions. It also proposes a multi-part and multi-scale cross-attention module to explore spatial relationships between objects and parts from a multi-scale perspective to enhance context-awareness.

4. Comprehensive experiments on four popular FGVC datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CSQA-Net over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposing of the CSQA-Net architecture that effectively regularizes global semantics using part descriptors and evaluates/enhances feature quality in real-time to improve fine-grained image categorization.
