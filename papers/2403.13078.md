# [HuLP: Human-in-the-Loop for Prognosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses two key challenges with existing prognostic models in clinical settings:

1) Lack of ability for clinicians to intervene: Current models do not allow clinicians to provide inputs or correct the model's predictions. This limits the clinicians' expertise from being incorporated to improve performance. 

2) Difficulty handling missing data: Prognosis often deals with incomplete clinical data and censored outcomes. Standard approaches use simplistic imputation methods which fail to capture complexity in medical data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new model called "Human-in-the-Loop Prognosis (HuLP)" with two main innovations:

1) Enables clinician intervention: HuLP allows clinicians to interact with the model during inference to provide expert input on the presence/absence of clinical concepts. This facilitates collaboration between human expertise and AI to enhance prognostic reliability.

2) Handles missing data effectively: HuLP leverages neural networks and an appropriate loss formulation to accommodate missing covariates and outcomes. It extracts features from images to implicitly impute missing clinical data, aligning with clinician workflows.

Key Contributions:

- Novel architecture to enable clinician inputs during inference to refine prognostic predictions 

- Robust mechanism to handle both missing covariates and outcomes through tailored methodology

- Significant performance gains over benchmarks on two real-world medical datasets

- Empowers human-AI collaboration, enhancing interpretability and reliability of prognostic models

In summary, HuLP facilitates active clinician interventions to improve prognostic modeling in contexts of missing data, advancing human-AI collaboration for better clinical decision making.
