# [Learning Cognitive Maps from Transformer Representations for Efficient   Planning in Partially Observed Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers partially observed environments (POEs) where an agent receives perceptually aliased observations as it navigates. This makes path planning challenging as the agent has to disambiguate observations and model history to locate itself.  
- Large transformer models trained for next-token prediction can predict well but cannot solve planning/navigation tasks. They do not learn interpretable world models that can be flexibly queried.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes the Transformer with Discrete Bottleneck(s) (TDB) which adds discrete bottleneck(s) to compress the transformer outputs into latent codes. 
- TDB is trained to predict future observations. Cognitive maps are then built from the active bottleneck indices to model environment dynamics.
- Two solutions are proposed to augment the training objective - (a) predict next S steps rather than just next step (b) predict next encoder output. This encourages more accurate cognitive maps.

Main Contributions:
- On POEs, TDB retains the predictive abilities of transformers while building accurate cognitive maps that can solve planning tasks exponentially faster using an external solver.
- TDB extracts interpretable latent graphs from text datasets while reaching higher test accuracy than vanilla transformers.
- When explored new POEs, TDB exhibits emergent in-context prediction abilities and can solve in-context planning tasks and learn accurate in-context cognitive maps.

In summary, the paper proposes TDB to address limitations of transformers for planning by learning discrete bottlenecks and cognitive maps. TDB retains strong prediction of transformers while gaining planning abilities and interpretability. The approach is demonstrated on navigation and text tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a transformer variant with discrete bottlenecks that learns interpretable cognitive maps of partially observed environments, which can be paired with an external solver to efficiently solve path planning problems that vanilla transformers struggle with.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a transformer variant called TDB (transformer with discrete bottleneck) that adds one or more discrete bottlenecks on top of a transformer. The key benefits of TDB are:

1) It retains the excellent next observation prediction abilities of vanilla transformers while also being able to solve path planning problems exponentially faster by using the learned cognitive map paired with an external solver. 

2) The discrete bottlenecks allow TDB to learn interpretable cognitive maps of partially observed environments that accurately model the environment's dynamics. These can be used with an external planner for efficient path planning.

3) TDB exhibits emergent in-context learning abilities - it can accurately predict next observations, solve path planning problems, and learn accurate cognitive maps of new environments it encounters at test time after being trained on other similar environments.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing TDB to address some of the limitations of transformers for tasks like planning and navigation, while retaining their strengths like prediction accuracy and in-context learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Partially observed environments (POEs): Environments where the agent receives perceptually aliased observations and cannot deterministically infer its location. Path planning is challenging in these environments.

- Transformers: Large neural network models based on self-attention that have shown strong performance on many language tasks. The paper proposes modifications to make transformers more suitable for path planning.

- Discrete bottlenecks: A component added on top of the transformer to compress the history of observations/actions into a discrete latent space. This enables building a cognitive map of the environment. 

- Cognitive maps: Interpretable environment models extracted from the transformer's discrete bottlenecks. These capture transitions between discrete states and can be paired with an external solver for efficient path planning.  

- In-context learning (ICL): The ability of models like transformers to rapidly adapt to new tasks and environments based on a few examples, without further training. The paper shows the model can do ICL to plan paths in new POEs.

- Multi-step prediction: Predicting multiple future observations instead of just one, which encourages more accurate state representations.  

- Next encoding prediction: Predicting future latent state representations helps build richer state representations.

Other key aspects are perceptually aliased observations, planning shortest paths, emergent in-context capacities, and modeling non-Euclidean environments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces a new model called Transformer with Discrete Bottleneck (TDB). How does adding discrete bottlenecks help transformers be used more effectively for path planning tasks? What specific limitations of standard transformers does this address?

2) The paper evaluates TDB on partially observed environments (POEs) with perceptual aliasing. What is perceptual aliasing and why does it make path planning challenging in these environments? How does TDB overcome this challenge? 

3) The cognitive maps extracted from the TDB model are used with an external solver to efficiently solve path planning problems. Explain what these cognitive maps represent and how pairing them with a solver enables fast path planning. 

4) What modifications were made to the training loss of TDB compared to a standard transformer? Explain the multi-step prediction objective and next encoding prediction objective. Why were these necessary?

5) TDB uses multiple discrete bottlenecks in some model variations. What is the motivation for having multiple bottlenecks? Do they learn disentangled representations based on the analysis done in the paper?

6) The paper argues that a TDB trained only to predict the next observation may fail to disambiguate distinct spatial positions with identical neighbors. Explain this limitation and why the multi-step prediction addresses it.  

7) The TDB model is shown to work well on 2D and 3D simulated environments. What visual representation was used as input for the 3D environments? How was the visual aliasing handled?

8) For the in-context learning experiments, explain what aspects of the model enable it to generalize to new test environments not seen during training. How does the in-context performance scale with more training rooms?

9) The paper demonstrates how TDB can also be applied to a text dataset (GINC) for next token prediction. How does the model extract an interpretable graph structure in this case? What does it represent?

10) The TDB model has some limitations mentioned such as lacking disentangled discrete bottlenecks and struggling with continuous observations. What modifications could be made to the model to address these? How might the overall framework be extended?
