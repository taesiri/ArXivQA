# [Threads of Subtlety: Detecting Machine-Generated Texts Through Discourse   Motifs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) that can generate highly realistic texts, distinguishing machine-generated texts from human-written ones has become increasingly challenging. Prior detection methods relying on surface-level features struggle with out-of-distribution samples and are vulnerable to paraphrasing attacks. 

Solution:
This paper proposes using hierarchical discourse structures and patterns called "discourse motifs" as features to enhance detection models. The key idea is that human writers utilize more nuanced, structured ways of conveying ideas that manifest at levels beyond surface text. 

The authors construct recursive hypergraphs from rhetorical structure theory (RST) parse trees of texts and analyze the distribution of discourse motifs (recurring subgraphs). Experiments show that incorporating motifs as features boosts model performance, even on out-of-distribution and paraphrased texts, demonstrating the usefulness of hierarchical discourse information.

Key Contributions:
- Novel methodology using RST hypergraphs and motif analysis to uncover distinguishable discourse patterns between human vs. machine texts.
- Empirical findings that discourse motifs enhance authorship detection, especially for out-of-distribution and paraphrased samples.
- Analysis showing human texts exhibit more structural variability and discourse motifs reflecting nuances across domains.
- Introduction of a new creative writing dataset for longer-form text analysis.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in exploiting hierarchical discourse structures to identify human vs. machine text authorship more robustly. The proposed motifs help capture deeper linguistic properties in human writing.
