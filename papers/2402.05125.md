# [Zero-Shot Clinical Trial Patient Matching with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05125)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying eligible patients for clinical trials is a major bottleneck, taking up to 1 hour per patient manually. This slows down drug development and prevents patients from accessing potentially beneficial treatments.  
- A key challenge is processing the unstructured clinical text in patient EHRs to determine if they meet the free text eligibility criteria. Traditional NLP methods have struggled with the idiosyncrasies of clinical text.

Proposed Solution:
- Use large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in a zero-shot setting to process free text eligibility criteria and patient notes to determine matches.
- Design prompting strategies to improve accuracy and efficiency. 
- Add a two-stage retrieval pipeline to reduce number of tokens processed.
- Evaluate interpretability by having clinicians review rationales.

Key Contributions:
- Achieved state-of-the-art results on 2018 n2c2 challenge benchmark with +6 Macro F1 score gain over prior best system. 
- Showed prompting strategies can improve cost-efficiency by an order of magnitude.
- Designed a retrieval pipeline that maintains high accuracy while cutting token usage by a third.  
- Demonstrated interpretability: clinicians agreed with 97% of rationales for correct decisions and 75% for incorrect ones.
- Established feasibility of using LLMs to accelerate clinical trial operations through accuracy, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Limitations:
- Small dataset size compared to real-world EHR systems
- Benchmark challenge simplifies actual trial matching scenarios
- Need further safety evaluations before real-world deployment
- Reliance on proprietary models like GPT-4 poses barriers for health systems


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops and evaluates large language model-based systems to efficiently and accurately match patients to clinical trials in a zero-shot setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Investigating the zero-shot (i.e. out-of-the-box) performance of LLMs on evaluating patient eligibility for clinical trials. Their GPT-4-based system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 2018 n2c2 cohort selection benchmark without requiring any training data or in-context examples.

2) Improving the data and cost efficiency of LLM-based trial matching systems. They identify prompting strategies to balance performance and cost, and design a two-stage retrieval pipeline that can reduce the number of tokens processed by up to a third while retaining high accuracy. 

3) Demonstrating the potential for human-in-the-loop deployment by having clinicians evaluate the natural language rationales generated by the LLM. They find GPT-4 generates correct rationales 97% of the time for correct decisions, and even 75% of the time for incorrect decisions.

In summary, the main contribution is showing the feasibility and efficiency of using large language models for zero-shot clinical trial patient matching.

The paper explores using large language models in a zero-shot learning setting to match patients to clinical trials based on free text eligibility criteria and the patients' EHR notes. It aims to develop an efficient system that has high accuracy, low cost, and interpretability. The key methods explored include various prompting strategies to query the LLMs and a two-stage retrieval pipeline to reduce the amount of text fed into the models. Overall, the key focus areas are leveraging LLMs for clinical trial operations, specifically patient matching, in an efficient and interpretable manner.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a zero-shot approach for clinical trial patient matching using large language models (LLMs). Why is a zero-shot approach advantageous compared to providing the LLM with training data or in-context examples? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The authors design a two-stage retrieval pipeline to reduce the number of tokens processed by the LLM. How does this pipeline work? What embedding models are tested for the first-stage retrieval? How much token reduction is achieved while preserving performance?

3. Four different prompting strategies (ACAN, ACIN, ICAN, ICIN) are evaluated. Can you explain what each strategy entails and how they differ? Which strategy gives the best balance of performance vs. cost?

4. How exactly does the LLM architecture work for assessing patient eligibility? What input prompt components are provided and what output is expected in the JSON response? Does the output contain confidence estimates or rationales? 

5. The authors improved the criteria definitions compared to the original n2c2 benchmark. What was the motivation behind this and how much did it improve performance? In a real deployment, could this step be avoided?

6. What specific limitations exist in the n2c2 benchmark dataset used compared to real-world clinical trial eligibility criteria and EHR data? How could the experimental setup be made more realistic?

7. Clinicians evaluated the rationales generates by the LLM - what metrics were used and what were the high-level results? What kinds of errors were identified?

8. The paper claims the LLM-based system is an order of magnitude faster than human evaluation. Is this comparison apples-to-apples? What other speedup factors are in play?

9. How was the LLM prompt engineering process conducted? Was the training set used or manual inspection of notes? What are other potential ways the prompts could be improved?

10. The authors use GPT models of various sizes. How did the performance scale with model size? What efficiency/capability gaps exist between proprietary vs. open source LLMs?
