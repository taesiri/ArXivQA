# [Siamese Learning with Joint Alignment and Regression for   Weakly-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video paragraph grounding (VPG) aims to localize multiple sentences with semantic relations and temporal order from an untrimmed video. 
- Existing VPG methods rely heavily on large amounts of temporal annotations which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain.
- Weakly-supervised video grounding methods have limitations like inferior generalization, quadratic complexity of proposals, and supervision gap.
- Weakly-supervised setting has not been explored for VPG (WSVPG).

Proposed Solution:
- A novel Siamese Grounding Transformer (SiamGTR) for efficient one-stage WSVPG without temporal labels.
- Two weight-sharing branches:
   - Augmentation Branch (AB): Regress boundaries in pseudo videos with paragraph as query.
   - Inference Branch (IB): Capture order-guided feature correspondence between sentences and normal video.
- AB provides boundary regression supervision, IB aligns cross-modal features.
- Order-guided attention loss enforces chronological alignment. 
- Self-consistent boundary regression selects high-quality samples.
- Framework can be easily adapted for semi-supervised learning.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce and explore WSVPG to eliminate need for temporal annotations.
- Propose SiamGTR with weight-sharing AB and IB for concise one-stage weakly-supervised learning of VPG via joint alignment and regression.
- Demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-arts under same/weaker supervision and flexibility for semi-supervised learning.

In summary, this paper pioneers the weakly-supervised setting for video paragraph grounding and proposes an effective and efficient Siamese Grounding Transformer to achieve this in a one-stage manner without relying on any timestamp labels.
