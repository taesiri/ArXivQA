# [DualToken-ViT: Position-aware Efficient Vision Transformer with Dual   Token Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12424)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to design an efficient yet high-performing vision transformer model. Specifically, the paper aims to combine the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) to create a model that is computationally efficient while still leveraging global information through an attention mechanism. The key ideas proposed to address this are:1) An efficient attention structure that fuses local information from a convolution-based module and global information from a self-attention-based module. 2) The use of position-aware global tokens throughout the model to further enrich global information while retaining position information.3) Strategies like step-wise downsampling and lightweight model designs to reduce computational complexity.Overall, the central hypothesis is that by judiciously combining aspects of CNNs and ViTs along with innovations like position-aware tokens, the authors can create a vision transformer model that achieves strong performance with high efficiency. The experiments aim to demonstrate this on image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the main points in the paper:The paper proposes an efficient vision transformer model called DualToken-ViT that fuses local information from convolution and global information from self-attention, and uses position-aware global tokens to enrich the global information while retaining positional information.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in efficient vision transformers:- The key idea of fusing local and global information in the attention mechanism is relatively novel compared to other works. Most prior efficient ViT methods focus on just local or global attention, but not combining both. - The use of position-aware global tokens throughout the network is unique. Other methods like MobileViT and LightViT use global tokens, but they are not position-aware. This allows DualToken-ViT to better retain positional information.- The overall model architecture builds off prior work like MobileViT and LightViT in using a pyramid design with decreasing spatial resolution. But the specific attention mechanisms in each block are different in DualToken-ViT.- The performance of DualToken-ViT seems very competitive for its efficiency. At 1.0G FLOPs, it achieves better ImageNet accuracy than most prior efficient ViTs. This suggests the design choices are working well.- For tasks like object detection and segmentation, DualToken-ViT also seems to outperform other methods of similar FLOPs. This indicates the positional information may be helping for dense prediction tasks.- One downside is that the cost of the position-aware global tokens adds some parameter overhead compared to methods with regular global tokens. But the performance gains seem to justify this cost.Overall, I think DualToken-ViT introduces some novel and effective ideas for efficient vision transformers. The fusion of local and global attention and use of position-aware tokens help it stand out from other works and achieve strong results. The overall pyramid design is relatively standard, but the attention mechanisms themselves seem more unique.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring other efficient structures for combining local and global information, beyond convolution and self-attention. The authors propose using convolution for local features and self-attention for global features, but mention there may be other effective ways to extract and fuse multi-scale information that could be explored.- Applying the DualToken architecture to other vision transformer backbones. The authors demonstrate DualToken on a specific efficient ViT backbone, but suggest it could likely improve other ViT models as well.- Extending DualToken to video tasks. The authors focus on image tasks, but note the global and positional information captured by DualToken could be useful for video understanding tasks. Exploring DualToken for video transformers is suggested.- Incorporating additional inductive biases beyond locality and translation equivariance. The authors designed DualToken to incorporate these specific biases, but note incorporating other useful priors for vision could further improve efficiency and performance. - Optimizing the model architecture and hyperparameters. The authors propose one instantiation of DualToken, but suggest further architecture search and hyperparameter tuning could lead to better trade-offs.- Applying the dual token concept to domains beyond computer vision. The authors focus on CV but suggest the dual token idea could be relevant for transformers in other modalities like NLP.In summary, the key directions are exploring alternative fusion mechanisms, applying it to new models and tasks, incorporating additional inductive biases, architecture search, and extending it beyond CV to other domains. The authors propose DualToken as a promising concept to build upon in many ways.
