# [Reformatted Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12219)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Creating high-quality instructional data to align AI systems with human values is crucial but challenging. Manual creation is labor-intensive and hard to scale. Automated extraction from existing datasets suffers from inherent limitations like factual errors and suboptimal formatting.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces ReAligned (\modelname), a simple yet effective method to automatically improve the quality of existing instructional data. 

- It has 3 key steps:
   1) Criteria Definition: Humans define preferred response formats for different tasks 
   2) Retrieval Augmentation: Retrieve external information to augment factuality for knowledge-intensive tasks
   3) Reformatting: Use LLMs to reformat existing responses to align with criteria and evidence

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates significant gains over strong baselines in alignment ability, math reasoning, factuality and readability
- Establishes state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning accuracy on GSM8K and MATH datasets
- Shows that only 5% ReAligned data yields 67% boost on Alpaca alignment metric, indicating data efficiency
- Minimizes human labor, factually incorrect content, and difficulty in scaling compared to prior instruction data enhancement techniques
- Provides public access to code and data to facilitate future research into interpretability and quality of LLMs

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions regarding quality enhancement of instructional data for AI alignment through an elegant collaboration between humans and LLMs while overcoming limitations of exclusively manual or automated approaches. The gains in alignment, reasoning and quality highlight the promise of this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ReAligned Alignment (\textsc{ReAlign}), a simple and effective method to improve the quality of existing instruction data for aligning large language models with human values, by defining criteria, augmenting retrieval, and reformatting responses to better match preferences and evidence without requiring additional annotation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple and effective method called Reformatted Alignment (\modelname) to improve the quality of existing instruction data for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Specifically, \modelname involves:

1) Defining criteria including tasks and formats for each task based on human preferences. 

2) Retrieving relevant external information to augment the knowledge base for knowledge-intensive tasks.  

3) Reformatting the original responses to align with the pre-established criteria and collated evidence, ensuring outputs that have better structure and are more substantiated.

The key benefits of \modelname highlighted in the paper are:

- Significantly boosts LLM alignment on general ability, math reasoning, factuality and readability without additional data or training techniques
- Minimizes human effort and factual errors compared to existing methods
- Remains orthogonal and complementary to other alignment techniques

In summary, the core contribution is a novel method to effectively improve existing instruction data quality and LLM alignment with minimal human involvement.

- Retrieval augmentation - Incorporating additional contextual information from retrieval to improve factuality.  

- Knowledge-intensive tasks - Tasks like QA which require external knowledge sources.

- Reformatting - Rewriting existing responses to match defined criteria and evidence.

- General alignment ability - Alignment with human values measured by benchmarks like AlpacaEval.

- Math reasoning ability - Numerical/mathematical reasoning ability measured on math dataset.  

- Factuality - Correctness of factual statements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a 3-step approach involving criteria definition, retrieval augmentation, and reformatting. Could you elaborate more on why this specific combination of steps was chosen? What was the reasoning behind including retrieval augmentation in some tasks but not others? 

2. The paper uses both manually crafted formats as well as an adaptive rewriting strategy during the reformatting stage. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each? In what scenarios would you choose one over the other?

3. One interesting finding is that only 5% of ReAligned data can yield a 67% boost on a downstream task. What implications does this have on the scaling properties and data efficiency of the proposed method? 

4. The paper evaluates performance on math, factuality, readability etc. Are there any other capabilities or dimensions along which ReAligned data could be evaluated? What kinds of new benchmarks could be designed?

5. ReAligned seems to work very well for certain kinds of logical/mathematical reasoning. However, how would its performance compare on more open-ended creative tasks like story generation? 

6. The paper argues ReAligned introduces minimal labor costs and hallucinations. But doesn't the criteria definition and format creation still require some human effort? How exactly is this effort minimized?

7. ChatGPT was used for some steps of ReAligned. Could other LLMs like GPT-3 also be plugged in its place? Would the choice of LLM significantly impact overall performance?

8. ReAligned currently works at the level of single responses. How could the method be extended to operate over conversations with multiple dialogue turns? Would new challenges emerge in that setting?

9. The authors suggest ReAligned data could be combined with other alignment techniques like debate and self-supervision. What would be some concrete ways to achieve this combination? What results might be expected?

10. What directions for future improvement and extension of ReAligned seem the most promising to you? Are there any major limitations currently that still need to be addressed?
