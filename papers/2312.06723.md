# [Learning to See Low-Light Images via Feature Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Raw low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visibility of low-light images captured in raw format. It involves two key tasks - denoising and color mapping (from raw to sRGB domain).
- Single-stage LLIE networks suffer from feature misalignment as they try to achieve both tasks using one network. Two-stage networks avoid this issue by decoupling the tasks but have large complexity.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a single-stage network called FDANet that decouples the two tasks using feature domain adaptation (FDA), combining efficiency of single-stage methods with effectiveness of two-stage methods.

- FDANet has two branches - a color mapping branch with FDA module, and a raw denoising branch. The encoder is shared between branches.

- The encoder features are first tailored for denoising task. The FDA module then adapts these features to sRGB domain before passing them to the color mapping decoder.

- FDA module uses a proposed Lineformer module to capture global correlation along image width and local correlation along image height efficiently.

- Auxiliary raw supervision is used on encoder features to constrain denoising task. This branch is removed at inference to allow single-stage enhancement.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes single-stage LLIE network that decouples denoising and color mapping using feature domain adaptation, combining strengths of both one-stage and two-stage methods.

- Proposes Lineformer as an efficient feature domain adaptation module to bridge gap between denoising and color mapping features.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets with 60% lesser parameters and FLOPs than previous best method.
