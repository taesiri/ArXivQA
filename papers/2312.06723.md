# [Learning to See Low-Light Images via Feature Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Raw low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visibility of low-light images captured in raw format. It involves two key tasks - denoising and color mapping (from raw to sRGB domain).
- Single-stage LLIE networks suffer from feature misalignment as they try to achieve both tasks using one network. Two-stage networks avoid this issue by decoupling the tasks but have large complexity.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a single-stage network called FDANet that decouples the two tasks using feature domain adaptation (FDA), combining efficiency of single-stage methods with effectiveness of two-stage methods.

- FDANet has two branches - a color mapping branch with FDA module, and a raw denoising branch. The encoder is shared between branches.

- The encoder features are first tailored for denoising task. The FDA module then adapts these features to sRGB domain before passing them to the color mapping decoder.

- FDA module uses a proposed Lineformer module to capture global correlation along image width and local correlation along image height efficiently.

- Auxiliary raw supervision is used on encoder features to constrain denoising task. This branch is removed at inference to allow single-stage enhancement.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes single-stage LLIE network that decouples denoising and color mapping using feature domain adaptation, combining strengths of both one-stage and two-stage methods.

- Proposes Lineformer as an efficient feature domain adaptation module to bridge gap between denoising and color mapping features.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets with 60% lesser parameters and FLOPs than previous best method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a single-stage network empowered by feature domain adaptation to decouple the denoising and color mapping tasks in raw low-light image enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost compared to two-stage methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a single-stage network to decouple the denoising and color mapping tasks in raw low-light image enhancement (LLIE). This combines the advantage of a two-stage enhancement process with the efficiency of single-stage inference.

2. It proposes a Feature Domain Adaptation (FDA) module to bridge the gap between denoising features and color mapping features. The FDA module uses a proposed Lineformer which explores both global and local correlations efficiently with fewer line buffers.

3. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets with only 60% of the parameters and FLOPs compared to previous two-stage methods.

In summary, the key innovation is using a single-stage network empowered by feature domain adaptation to decouple the noise removal and color mapping tasks in raw low-light image enhancement. This achieves better performance than two-stage methods with lower complexity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Raw low-light image enhancement (LLIE): The main task that the paper focuses on, which aims to improve the visibility and details of low-light raw images.

- Feature domain adaptation (FDA): A key technique proposed in the paper to bridge the gap between features suitable for denoising and features suitable for color mapping. This allows a single network to perform both tasks.

- Lineformer: The module proposed for feature domain adaptation, which explores both global and local correlations efficiently with fewer line buffers.

- Single-stage network: The overall network architecture is a single-stage framework for efficiency, unlike two-stage methods. But it uses techniques like FDA and raw supervision to decouple the denoising and color mapping tasks.

- Denoising, color mapping: The two main sub-tasks in LLIE that need to be handled, denoising to remove noise and color mapping to map raw images to sRGB.

- Raw supervision: An auxiliary task added during training to constrain the encoder features for better denoising. Removed during inference for efficiency.

- Benchmark datasets: SID, LRID, MCR - various raw image datasets used for evaluation of LLIE techniques.
