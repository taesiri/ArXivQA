# [A Survey on Self-Supervised Pre-Training of Graph Foundation Models: A   Knowledge-Based Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16137)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Existing graph pre-training methods have two limitations: (1) Existing surveys only focus on one type of graph models (GNNs, Transformers, LLMs) leading to an incomplete view. (2) Broad categorizations of graph SSL methods as "generative vs contrastive" are insufficient to capture the diverse knowledge patterns embedded in graphs. 

Key Idea and Solution:
- Propose a comprehensive survey on self-supervised pre-training strategies for all major graph models from a knowledge-based taxonomy. The taxonomy categorizes tasks based on the type of graph knowledge they utilize - microscopic (node-level) or macroscopic (global-level).

Microscopic Knowledge:
- Node features (feature prediction, feature denoising, instance discrimination)  
- Node properties (centrality prediction, node order matching)
- Links (link prediction, link denoising, edge feature prediction)  
- Context (context discrimination, neighbor feature prediction, contextual property prediction)

Macroscopic Knowledge:  
- Long-range similarities (similarity prediction, path denoising, similarity graph alignment)
- Motifs (motif prediction, motif discrimination)
- Clusters (node clustering, graph partitioning)
- Global structure (global/global-local discrimination, graph kernel prediction) 
- Manifolds (cross-manifold discrimination, hyperbolic angle prediction)

Additional Highlights:
- Discussion of limitations of existing pretexts
- Overview of downstream task adaptation strategies 
- Focus on pre-training strategies for emerging LLM-based graph models
- Future directions for graph self-supervised learning

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy and review of graph self-supervised pre-training strategies from a knowledge perspective to better analyze and guide future research directions.
