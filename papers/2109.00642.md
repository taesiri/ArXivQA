# [Searching for Efficient Multi-Stage Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00642)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can design techniques from convolutional neural networks be incorporated into vision transformers to improve their efficiency and performance on image classification tasks?

Specifically, the paper proposes two main techniques:

1) Residual spatial reduction to transform the single-stage vision transformer (ViT) architecture into a more efficient multi-stage design. This is inspired by CNN techniques like progressively reducing spatial resolution and increasing channel size in deeper layers.

2) Weight-sharing neural architecture search with multi-architectural sampling to further optimize the multi-stage ViT architecture. This allows searching over architectural hyperparameters like number of attention heads and transformer blocks. The multi-architectural sampling during training improves search efficiency.

The overall goal is to develop an efficient multi-stage vision transformer architecture called ViT-ResNAS that achieves better accuracy and efficiency trade-offs compared to vanilla ViT models and other ViT variants on image classification benchmarks like ImageNet.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that incorporating these two CNN-inspired techniques - residual spatial reduction and neural architecture search - can improve the performance and efficiency of vision transformers for image classification tasks. The paper presents ViT-ResNAS as a way to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing residual spatial reduction to improve the efficiency of ViT by reducing sequence lengths and increasing embedding sizes for deeper layers. This divides the network into multiple stages and improves accuracy-computation trade-offs.

2. Proposing weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS) with multi-architectural sampling to further improve the architecture of ViT with residual spatial reduction (ViT-Res). This trains the super-network more efficiently by sampling multiple sub-networks per training iteration and using masked layer normalization. 

3. Presenting ViT-ResNAS, an efficient multi-stage ViT architecture designed with the proposed techniques. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ViT-ResNAS achieves better accuracy-computation and accuracy-throughput trade-offs compared to original ViT and other baselines.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing residual spatial reduction and a NAS method to design an improved multi-stage ViT architecture called ViT-ResNAS with better efficiency. The residual connections, multi-architectural sampling during NAS, and experiments demonstrating superior trade-offs are the main novel parts proposed in this paper.

The paper proposes incorporating residual spatial reduction and weight-sharing neural architecture search with multi-architectural sampling to design an efficient multi-stage Vision Transformer (ViT-ResNAS) that achieves better accuracy-MACs and accuracy-throughput tradeoffs compared to original ViT and other variants on ImageNet image classification.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on Vision Transformers:

- It builds off of previous works like ViT and DeiT that show transformers can achieve strong performance on image classification. The authors propose new techniques to further improve ViT's efficiency and accuracy.

- It incorporates design principles from CNNs like progressive feature map downsampling and neural architecture search to optimize multi-stage Vision Transformer architectures. Many other works have focused on adapting transformers for computer vision but don't borrow these techniques.

- The proposed residual spatial reduction creates a more efficient multi-stage architecture compared to previous transformers like ViT which maintain sequence length throughout. Other works like PVT and PiT have explored multi-stage designs as well.

- The weight-sharing neural architecture search with multi-architectural sampling is a novel way to search for optimal Vision Transformer configurations. NAS has been widely studied for CNNs but less for transformers. Sampling multiple architectures per training iteration is also unique.

- Experiments show ViT-ResNAS finds models with better accuracy-MAC tradeoffs than previous vision transformers like DeiT, PiT, and PVT. The weight-sharing NAS is shown to improve sample efficiency and performance over single architecture sampling.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Optimizing the search space for neural architecture search (NAS). The authors note that the performance of networks found through NAS relies on the manually designed search space. They suggest that optimizing the search space, such as setting better ranges for architectural parameters, could lead to additional performance improvements.

- Incorporating more efficient attention mechanisms into the search space. The authors point out that the attention mechanism used in their work can have high memory consumption when processing high-resolution feature maps. They suggest incorporating approaches like local attention to address this issue.

- Exploring additional techniques from computer vision and other domains to further improve Vision Transformers. The authors propose combining techniques like spatial reduction and NAS from CNNs to improve ViT, and suggest investigating what other techniques could help advance ViTs.

- Developing unified architectures for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. The authors discuss the appeal of having powerful Transformers that can be used across CV and NLP. Searching for architectures specialized to each domain could aid in developing unified models.

- Continuing to benchmark performance on datasets like ImageNet. As ViT architectures and training techniques continue to advance, benchmarking on standard datasets will help quantify progress.

In summary, the main directions mentioned are optimizing the NAS search space and architectural choices to improve efficiency and accuracy, drawing inspiration across domains, and developing unified CV/NLP models, while continuing to benchmark progress on established datasets. Advancing ViT architectures through techniques like the authors propose is highlighted as a promising research direction.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ViT-ResNAS, an efficient multi-stage Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture designed with neural architecture search. First, the authors incorporate residual spatial reduction into ViT to divide it into multiple stages. This technique reduces the sequence length and increases the embedding dimension for deeper layers, similar to how convolutional neural networks reduce resolution and increase channels. Adding residual connections helps stabilize training deeper networks. Second, the authors perform neural architecture search with weight sharing and multi-architectural sampling to further improve the architecture.

Experiments on ImageNet classification demonstrate the effectiveness of ViT-ResNAS. Compared to the original DeiT models, ViT-ResNAS achieves significantly higher accuracy with similar or much lower computational cost. It also outperforms other Vision Transformer models like PVT and PiT in terms of accuracy-MACs and accuracy-throughput tradeoffs. For example, ViT-ResNAS-Tiny is 8.6% more accurate than DeiT-Ti while having slightly higher MACs, and ViT-ResNAS-Small achieves similar accuracy as DeiT-Base with 6.3x lower MACs and 3.7x higher throughput. The results show the proposed techniques can improve the efficiency of Vision Transformers.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ViT-ResNAS, an efficient multi-stage vision transformer (ViT) architecture designed with neural architecture search (NAS). The authors first introduce residual spatial reduction to divide the single-stage ViT into a multi-stage one, with each stage having reduced sequence length and increased embedding size. This is analogous to how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) decrease feature map resolution in deeper layers. Critically, residual connections are added when reducing sequence length to stabilize training and boost performance. The resulting architecture is called ViT-Res. Next, the authors propose a weight-sharing NAS method to search for optimal ViT-Res architectures. They build a large super-network covering all possible sub-network architectures and train it with a novel multi-architectural sampling technique, allowing efficient training by sampling multiple sub-networks per training iteration. Evolutionary search is then used to discover high-performance sub-networks. Experiments on ImageNet show that ViT-ResNAS achieves better accuracy-MACs and accuracy-throughput tradeoffs compared to DeiT and other ViT baselines. For instance, ViT-ResNAS-Tiny improves accuracy by 8.6% over DeiT-Tiny while using slightly more MACs, and ViT-ResNAS-Small matches DeiT-Base accuracy with 6.3x fewer MACs. This demonstrates the viability of adapting CNN design techniques like spatial reduction and NAS to improve Vision Transformer efficiency.
