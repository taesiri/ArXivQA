# [Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image   Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful deep generative priors for solving image restoration problems like denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution. However, adapting diffusion models for these inverse problems is challenging as the sampling process is formulated for unconditional image generation, whereas image restoration requires conditional sampling based on the corrupted measurements. 

Recent methods address this by approximating the intractable likelihood term and injecting it into the reverse sampling process. But these approaches have limitations:
1) Coupling likelihood term with sampling increases computation and limits use of fast samplers 
2) Sensitivity to hyperparameters that control coupling strength
3) Difficult to extend to latent diffusion models 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a diffusion restoration framework that \textbf{decouples} the likelihood optimization from the diffusion sampling:

1) \textbf{Reconstruction phase}: Generate measurement-consistent reconstructions by optimizing data fidelity loss (doesn't require score func gradients) 

2) \textbf{Refinement phase}: Refine reconstructions using diffusion model prior via \textbf{diffusion purification} 

This alternating approach confers several advantages:

- Flexible integration of any diffusion model 
- Robustness to hyperparameters
- Compatible with accelerated samplers like DDIMs
- Easily extended to latent diffusion  

The key insight is to use diffusion purification as an implicit regularization that restricts outputs to range of diffusion model while removing artifacts. A decaying schedule for purification strength is proposed.

Contributions:
- Novel diffusion restoration framework with decoupled consistency and sampling
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across image restoration tasks
- Over 5x speedup compared to current methods
- Flexible incorporation of fast samplers and latent diffusion

The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments on image denoising, deblurring, inpainting and super-resolution. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of decoupling strategy.
