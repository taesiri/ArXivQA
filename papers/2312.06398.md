# [NVFi: Neural Velocity Fields for 3D Physics Learning from Dynamic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06398)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called NVFi for modeling dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view video frames. The key idea is to simultaneously learn a disentangled representation of scene geometry, appearance, and physical velocity fields, without needing any mask or type information about objects. The method consists of two components: a keyframe dynamic radiance field to capture geometry and appearance over time, and an interframe velocity field to model scene dynamics. A joint optimization strategy with physics-based losses is used to effectively train both components. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NVFi's superior performance on future frame extrapolation, unsupervised 3D scene decomposition, and motion transfer across scenes. The disentangled velocity representation unlocks these applications not achievable by existing dynamic scene modeling techniques. Overall, this is an ambitious work towards physical scene understanding, with promising results on learning meaningful scene dynamics purely from videos.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called NVFi to model dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view videos by simultaneously learning disentangled representations of geometry, appearance, and physical velocity fields using keyframe dynamic radiance fields, interframe velocity fields, and joint optimization of both components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a general framework to model dynamic 3D scenes as physics-informed radiance fields from multi-view videos, without requiring information on object types, materials, or masks.

2. Designing a neural velocity field together with a joint keyframe and interframe optimization method to effectively train the networks.  

3. Demonstrating three applications for the learned velocity fields on two newly collected dynamic 3D datasets and a challenging real-world dataset: superior performance in future frame extrapolation, semantic scene decomposition, and velocity transferring across 3D scenes.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a method to simultaneously model the geometry, appearance, and disentangled velocity of dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view videos for multiple applications, by jointly optimizing a keyframe dynamic radiance field and an interframe velocity field.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Neural radiance fields (NeRF) - The paper builds on recent work in modeling 3D scenes as neural radiance fields.

- Dynamic 3D scenes - The goal is to model dynamic, changing 3D scenes over time from input video.

- Disentangled velocity fields - A key contribution is learning a separate neural representation of the velocity field to model scene dynamics, disentangled from the scene's geometry and appearance.

- Future frame extrapolation - Modeling velocity fields allows predicting future frames beyond the input video timeframe.  

- Unsupervised 3D semantic decomposition - The learned velocity fields enable segmenting a dynamic 3D scene into distinct moving objects without supervision.

- Motion transfer - The disentangled velocity representation allows realistically transferring motion patterns from one dynamic scene to another.

- Keyframe optimization - They propose a keyframe-based optimization strategy to effectively train the dynamic radiance field. 

- Joint optimization - A core contribution is the joint optimization method to train both the dynamic radiance field and velocity field networks.

So in summary, some key terms revolve around disentangled velocity fields, future extrapolation, semantic decomposition, motion transfer, and joint optimization of neural dynamic scene representations.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing methods for modeling dynamic 3D scenes from videos focus on novel view synthesis within the training time period. They lack the ability to model the underlying physical properties like velocity fields, thus being unable to predict future motions or transfer motions across scenes. Learning disentangled velocity fields is challenging due to lack of ground truth annotations, unknown object types/materials, and sparse long-time trajectories.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new framework called NVFi to simultaneously model geometry, appearance and disentangled velocity fields of dynamic 3D scenes only from multi-view videos. The framework has three key components:

1) Keyframe dynamic radiance field to efficiently learn time-dependent geometry and appearance by sampling keyframes instead of all frames. 

2) Interframe velocity field parameterized as MLPs to learn time-dependent 3D velocity for every spatial point.

3) Joint optimization strategy with physics-based losses to effectively train both networks. This enables learning accurate and disentangled velocity fields without needing object masks, types or materials.

Main Contributions:

1) A general framework to model dynamic 3D scenes as physics-informed radiance fields from multi-view videos, without needing extra supervision.

2) A neural velocity field design and joint keyframe-interframe optimization method to precisely learn scene dynamics.

3) Demonstrated three applications enabled by the disentangled velocity fields: future frame extrapolation, unsupervised semantic decomposition, and velocity transfer across scenes.

4) Introduced two new datasets of dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, this paper presents a novel way to model dynamic 3D scenes by disentangling the physical velocity field. This allows predicting future motions and transferring velocity across scenes. The introduced framework and joint optimization strategy effectively achieve this goal without extra supervision.
