# [NVFi: Neural Velocity Fields for 3D Physics Learning from Dynamic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06398)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called NVFi for modeling dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view video frames. The key idea is to simultaneously learn a disentangled representation of scene geometry, appearance, and physical velocity fields, without needing any mask or type information about objects. The method consists of two components: a keyframe dynamic radiance field to capture geometry and appearance over time, and an interframe velocity field to model scene dynamics. A joint optimization strategy with physics-based losses is used to effectively train both components. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NVFi's superior performance on future frame extrapolation, unsupervised 3D scene decomposition, and motion transfer across scenes. The disentangled velocity representation unlocks these applications not achievable by existing dynamic scene modeling techniques. Overall, this is an ambitious work towards physical scene understanding, with promising results on learning meaningful scene dynamics purely from videos.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called NVFi to model dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view videos by simultaneously learning disentangled representations of geometry, appearance, and physical velocity fields using keyframe dynamic radiance fields, interframe velocity fields, and joint optimization of both components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a general framework to model dynamic 3D scenes as physics-informed radiance fields from multi-view videos, without requiring information on object types, materials, or masks.

2. Designing a neural velocity field together with a joint keyframe and interframe optimization method to effectively train the networks.  

3. Demonstrating three applications for the learned velocity fields on two newly collected dynamic 3D datasets and a challenging real-world dataset: superior performance in future frame extrapolation, semantic scene decomposition, and velocity transferring across 3D scenes.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a method to simultaneously model the geometry, appearance, and disentangled velocity of dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view videos for multiple applications, by jointly optimizing a keyframe dynamic radiance field and an interframe velocity field.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Neural radiance fields (NeRF) - The paper builds on recent work in modeling 3D scenes as neural radiance fields.

- Dynamic 3D scenes - The goal is to model dynamic, changing 3D scenes over time from input video.

- Disentangled velocity fields - A key contribution is learning a separate neural representation of the velocity field to model scene dynamics, disentangled from the scene's geometry and appearance.

- Future frame extrapolation - Modeling velocity fields allows predicting future frames beyond the input video timeframe.  

- Unsupervised 3D semantic decomposition - The learned velocity fields enable segmenting a dynamic 3D scene into distinct moving objects without supervision.

- Motion transfer - The disentangled velocity representation allows realistically transferring motion patterns from one dynamic scene to another.

- Keyframe optimization - They propose a keyframe-based optimization strategy to effectively train the dynamic radiance field. 

- Joint optimization - A core contribution is the joint optimization method to train both the dynamic radiance field and velocity field networks.

So in summary, some key terms revolve around disentangled velocity fields, future extrapolation, semantic decomposition, motion transfer, and joint optimization of neural dynamic scene representations.
