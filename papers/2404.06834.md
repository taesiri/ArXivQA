# [Solving Parametric PDEs with Radial Basis Functions and Deep Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on efficiently solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) defined on irregular domains. Parametric PDEs are important tools for modeling complex physical phenomena across science and engineering fields. However, directly solving parametric PDEs for many different parameter values is computationally expensive. This is further exacerbated for PDEs over irregular domains, where traditional numeric solvers like finite differences struggle. Hence, there is a need for accurate and efficient numerical algorithms to solve parametric PDEs over irregular domains.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel POD-DNN algorithm that synergistically combines:
(1) Meshfree radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) method to discretize the irregular domain
(2) Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced basis method to exploit the low-dimensional structure of the parametric PDE solutions
(3) Deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn the input parameter to solution coefficient mapping enabled by POD.

Specifically, the RBF-FD method discretizes the PDE on scattered nodes over the irregular domain. POD extracts the most dominant subspace to project the high-fidelity RBF-FD solutions. This subspace encodes the solution's parametric dependence efficiently. DNNs are then trained in the offline stage to capture the input parameter to POD coefficient mapping. Online prediction only requires a single DNN forward pass, enabling real-time efficient inference.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposal of an end-to-end numerical scheme (POD-DNN algorithm) for parametric PDEs on irregular domains via integrating meshfree RBF-FD discretization, POD model order reduction and DNN approximation.

2) Demonstration of significantly accelerated online computation compared to traditional methods, while maintaining accuracy. Easy parallelizability of DNNs for simultaneous multi-query solutions.

3) Theoretical analysis providing approximation guarantees on the DNN complexity to achieve a desired accuracy in learning the parametric mapping. Proved depth and number of parameters scale as O(log(1/ɛ)) and O(n3 log2(1/ɛ)2) respectively.

The paper is rigorously supported by numerical experiments and comparisons. The POD-DNN algorithm shows superior computational performance over state-of-the-art baselines.
