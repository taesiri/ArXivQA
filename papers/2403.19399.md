# [KazParC: Kazakh Parallel Corpus for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation (MT) for many languages suffers from a lack of parallel corpora (collections of texts with translations). This is especially true for lower-resourced languages like Kazakh.
- Existing Kazakh parallel corpora have issues like repetitive sentences, misaligned sentence pairs, and over-reliance on governmental texts. This reduces the quality and diversity of data available.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce KazParC, a new parallel corpus for machine translation between Kazakh, English, Russian and Turkish.
- KazParC has 371,902 sentence pairs covering diverse domains like law, literature, news, etc. The sentences were manually translated and verified by humans.
- The authors also created a neural MT model called Tilmash, fine-tuned on KazParC and synthetic data. 

Main Contributions:
- KazParC is the first publicly available parallel corpus between Kazakh, English, Russian and Turkish. With 41,600 human-hours of work, it is also the largest of its kind.
- Tilmash matches or exceeds the performance of Yandex Translate and Google Translate on test sets, showing the value of the corpus. It has particular strength in legal documents and everyday expressions.
- The availability of KazParC and Tilmash significantly improves resources for machine translation involving Kazakh, which is relatively lower-resourced. This enables future research to build on this foundation.

In conclusion, the paper makes Kazakh-English/Russian/Turkish machine translation more viable by releasing KazParC, a large, clean, diverse parallel corpus, and Tilmash, a competitive neural MT model fine-tuned on this data.
