# [State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16899)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Foundation models like GPT have shown great success in language tasks. However, they rely on the Transformer architecture which has two key limitations: 1) poor scalability with sequence length due to the attention mechanism's computational complexity, and 2) lack of interpretability. Recent work proposes replacing the Transformer with state space models (SSMs) which encode sequential data into a latent space to address these issues. However, most SSM designs lack a principled, system theoretic understanding.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides an overview of state-of-the-art SSM architectures from a control theory perspective. It reviews the mathematical structure and design considerations in SSMs like parametrization, discretization, structure/initialization, implementation, and scaffolding. It then systematically summarizes the most prominent SSM models (S4, S4D, S5, LRU, S6, RG-LRU), analyzing their features through a control lens. It also empirically compares SSM performance on a long sequence benchmark.

Main Contributions:
- First overview analyzing recent SSM architectures for foundation models from a control theory viewpoint
- Summary of mathematical formulations and design choices in SSMs  
- Systematic review of major SSM models highlighting control-theoretic connections 
- Empirical evaluation comparing SSM model performance on long sequence benchmark
- Identification of open questions at intersection of foundation models and control theory

The paper helps connect the domains of foundation models and control theory, providing opportunities to enhance SSM designs. It also highlights interesting future work like attaining LTV performance comparable to LTI SSMs. Overall, it enables cross-pollination between the fields through a control perspective on modern SSM architectures.
