# [BATON: Aligning Text-to-Audio Model with Human Preference Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00744)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-audio (TTA) models face challenges in generating audio that aligns with human preferences, exhibited in issues like low integrity (missing audio events) and incorrect temporal relationships. 
- No existing approaches leverage human preference feedback to address this misalignment.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose BATON, a framework to align TTA models using human preference feedback. It involves 3 key steps:
  1) Dataset Construction: 
     - Generate text prompts using GPT-4 conditioned on audio labels.  
     - Synthesize corresponding audio using TTA model TANGO.
     - Collect human binary feedback on text-audio pairs regarding integrity and temporal relationships.
  2) Audio Reward Model:
     - Train a model on human-annotated dataset to predict human preference as a reward signal.
  3) Fine-tuning TTA Model:  
     - Fine-tune TANGO model by maximizing reward-weighted likelihood to enhance alignment.

Main Contributions:
- Constructed a dataset with 4.8K text-audio pairs across 200 categories, with 2.7K samples annotated by humans.
- Introduced an audio reward model tailored to predict human feedback on text-audio alignment. Experiments show its predictions correlate well with human judgments.  
- Demonstrated BATON's efficacy in improving integrity (+2.3\% CLAP) and temporal relationships (+6.0\% CLAP) of TTA models over strong baselines, with superior human evaluation results.
- Proposed the first framework to harness human feedback for aligning text-to-audio generation models.

In summary, BATON leverages human preference feedback to effectively mitigate biases and improve alignment in TTA models. The paper makes valuable contributions towards advancing text-to-audio synthesis with human guidance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called BATON that aligns text-to-audio models with human preferences by collecting human feedback on generated audio samples, training a reward model to predict human preferences, and fine-tuning a text-to-audio model using the reward model to weight the training loss.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Generating a dataset with 4.8K text-audio pairs across 200 audio event categories, in which 2.7K samples are annotated by human annotators.

2. Training an audio reward model on the human-annotated data to predict a scalar reward reflecting the human preference for the alignment between the input text and audio. Experiments show the predicted rewards closely correlate with human judgments.  

3. Utilizing the audio reward model to enhance an off-the-shelf text-to-audio model in terms of the integrity and temporal relationship of audio events. Detailed experiments provide strong support for the effectiveness of this approach.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework (BATON) that leverages human preference feedback to improve the alignment between text prompts and generated audio in text-to-audio models. The paper provides both the dataset, reward model, and experimental results to demonstrate the utility of this approach.

- Conditional denoising autoencoder

The paper proposes a framework called BATON to align text-to-audio models using human preference feedback. It focuses on improving the integrity and temporal relationships of generated audio by collecting human annotations on synthetic text-audio pairs. A key component is training an audio reward model on this annotated dataset to predict human preferences. This model is then used to fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion text-to-audio model through reward-weighted likelihood maximization. Both automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate gains in alignment and quality compared to baseline models.
