# [Media2Face: Co-speech Facial Animation Generation With Multi-Modality   Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating realistic 3D facial animations from speech is challenging due to the lack of high-quality 4D facial data and the difficulty in enabling flexible conditioning from diverse modalities like speech, style, or emotion. Existing methods often suffer from limited realism, diversity, and controllability.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a trilogy of solutions:

1. GNPFA: A variational autoencoder that maps facial geometry and images to a generalized expression latent space, disentangling identity and expression. It is pre-trained on a large multi-identity 4D facial scanning dataset.

2. M2F-D: Using GNPFA to extract high-quality expressions and poses from a diverse range of videos, creating a large 4D facial animation dataset with 60 hours of data and annotations of emotions and styles.

3. Media2Face: A transformer-based diffusion model trained in the GNPFA latent space on M2F-D to generate co-speech facial animations. It takes speech features, text embeddings, and image embeddings as conditions to enable flexible control.

Main Contributions:

- GNPFA to enable collection of high-quality 4D facial data from videos using a learned latent space
- M2F-D, a large and diverse 4D facial animation dataset with emotion and style labels 
- Media2Face diffusion model for flexible facial animation generation with speech and text/image conditioning
- State-of-the-art facial animation quality and controllability demonstrated through experiments and user studies
- Applications like dialog generation, singing, and conditional editing showcased

The proposed trilogy of solutions pushes the boundary of realistic and controllable facial animation generation with multi-modal conditioning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Media2Face, a diffusion model for generating realistic 3D facial animations from speech audio conditioned on text or images, enabled by a novel facial expression latent space and a large-scale co-speech facial animation dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Media2Face, a diffusion-based generator that integrates diverse media inputs (audio, image, and text) to drive vivid facial animations including head poses.

2. GNPFA, a neural latent representation to capture nuanced facial motion details, enabling the collection of a diverse co-speech 4D facial animation dataset (M2F-D) with annotated expressions and styles. 

3. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Media2Face in generating high-quality and controllable facial animations. Exciting applications are showcased such as reconstructing dialogue situations and multi-modality conditional editing.

Overall, this paper presents a significant advance in realistic human-centric AI virtual companions that can form strong emotional connections by generating facial animations that sync with speech and express nuanced human emotions contained in text, images, and even music.
