# [Variational Autoencoders for exteroceptive perception in reinforcement   learning-based collision avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00623)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling autonomous marine vessels to safely navigate dynamic environments with obstacles while following desired paths. Traditional control methods struggle with unknown or dynamic obstacles. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods can learn policies for navigation and collision avoidance, but often require disproportionally large computational resources when input spaces become very high-dimensional (e.g. raw sensor data).  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to obtain a low-dimensional latent encoding of a vessel's high-fidelity 180-dimensional range-finding sensor input. This latent encoding serves as the input to a DRL agent (Proximal Policy Optimization) tasked with path following and collision avoidance. The VAE is pre-trained to extract useful features before integrating its encoder into the DRL algorithm.  

Contributions:
- Successfully integrates a VAE feature extractor into a DRL agent for maritime path following and collision avoidance
- Compares shallow and deep VAE architectures, finding the shallow model performs best
- Shows circular padding in the VAE decoder significantly improves reconstructions 
- Demonstrates the impact of the Î² hyperparameter on preventing posterior collapse and overfitting in the VAE
- Evaluates DRL agent performance with different locked/unlocked VAE encoder configurations
- Finds a locked, shallow VAE encoder provides the most efficient trajectories and path adherence compared to unlocked or baseline variants
- Reveals a potential tradeoff between efficiency and collision risk that warrants further analysis

In summary, the central contribution is demonstrating that a pre-trained, shallow VAE can effectively encode high-dimensional range sensor data to serve as an efficient input representation for maritime navigation using DRL, outperforming non-VAE variants, albeit with some increase in collision risk. The work provides a basis for further analysis of this risk vs efficiency tradeoff.
