# [Evaluation of Active Feature Acquisition Methods for Static Feature   Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03619)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the problem of evaluating active feature acquisition (AFA) methods, which determine the optimal set of features to acquire for a subsequent classification task. Specifically, it focuses on the setting where features are static, meaning their values do not change over time. This allows more flexibility for the AFA agent to decide the order of acquisitions. The paper introduces the problem of AFA performance evaluation (AFAPE) to estimate the costs an AFA agent would incur upon deployment based on retrospective data. It shows AFAPE can be solved via missing data or semi-offline reinforcement learning viewpoints. Under a MAR assumption, novel semi-offline RL estimators based on IP weighting, direct methods, and double reinforcement learning are derived that are consistent and doubly robust while relaxing positivity assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data with synthetic missingness validate the proposed estimators and show they efficiently leverage the data. The semi-offline RL viewpoint is also extended to address MNAR scenarios. Overall, the paper delivers a rigorous statistical framework for reliably evaluating AFA methods to enable their safe clinical deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a semi-offline reinforcement learning framework to evaluate active feature acquisition methods under static feature settings using weaker missing data assumptions, allowing improved estimation efficiency and more reliable assessment of deployment performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two main contributions:

1. It extends the concept of semi-offline reinforcement learning, previously introduced for time-series active feature acquisition settings, to static feature settings. In static settings, features do not change over time, allowing more flexibility in deciding the order of acquisitions. 

2. It develops new semi-offline RL estimators (inverse probability weighting, direct method, and double reinforcement learning) for evaluating active feature acquisition agents in static settings under missing-at-random or missing-not-at-random assumptions. These estimators demonstrate improved data efficiency and relaxed positivity requirements compared to prior missing data or offline RL approaches.

The paper illustrates through synthetic experiments and real-world data that the proposed semi-offline RL estimators can provide accurate performance estimates for active feature acquisition agents, while biased evaluation methods may lead to poor decisions about agent deployment. Overall, it offers an improved framework for reliably evaluating such agents.

The paper develops a semi-offline reinforcement learning framework to evaluate AFA agents designed to sequentially acquire costly features for a classification task. Key goals are identification (determining conditions to estimate performance) and estimation (developing unbiased estimators) under MAR and MNAR missingness and a static feature assumption. Novel IPW, DM, and DRL estimators with improved efficiency and weaker positivity requirements are proposed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) What is the key motivation behind developing semi-offline reinforcement learning methods for evaluating active feature acquisition systems? Why can't conventional offline RL or missing data methods address this problem effectively?

2) How does the semi-offline RL approach balance between the offline and online aspects during policy evaluation? What assumptions enable the identification results under this framework?

3) Explain the differences in positivity requirements between the missing data view and the semi-offline RL view. Why does semi-offline RL offer more flexibility in leveraging the retrospective data?

4) Walk through the detailed steps involved in deriving the efficient influence function under the semi-offline RL framework. What are some limitations of the proposed influence function? 

5) The paper proposes IPW, DM and DRL estimators under semi-offline RL. Contrast their statistical properties such as robustness, efficiency, and rate of convergence. 

6) How can the semi-offline RL view be extended to missing-not-at-random (MNAR) settings? Explain the key ideas behind the proposed hybrid framework combining semi-offline RL and missing data perspectives.

7) Critically analyze the experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets. Do the findings conclusively validate the benefits of the semi-offline RL based estimators?

8) Suggest some potential directions to enhance the proposed semi-offline RL method - this could be around relaxations of assumptions, handling complex missingness patterns, optimization of acquisition policies etc.

9) Discuss the connections between the semi-offline RL framework and other areas such as off-policy evaluation and dynamic treatment regimes. How can these links be leveraged further?

10) What are some key limitations of the current work? Particularly focus on aspects around practical adoption - sample complexity, computational complexity, sensitivity to hyperparameter selections etc.
