# [Evaluation of Active Feature Acquisition Methods for Static Feature   Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03619)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the problem of evaluating active feature acquisition (AFA) methods, which determine the optimal set of features to acquire for a subsequent classification task. Specifically, it focuses on the setting where features are static, meaning their values do not change over time. This allows more flexibility for the AFA agent to decide the order of acquisitions. The paper introduces the problem of AFA performance evaluation (AFAPE) to estimate the costs an AFA agent would incur upon deployment based on retrospective data. It shows AFAPE can be solved via missing data or semi-offline reinforcement learning viewpoints. Under a MAR assumption, novel semi-offline RL estimators based on IP weighting, direct methods, and double reinforcement learning are derived that are consistent and doubly robust while relaxing positivity assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data with synthetic missingness validate the proposed estimators and show they efficiently leverage the data. The semi-offline RL viewpoint is also extended to address MNAR scenarios. Overall, the paper delivers a rigorous statistical framework for reliably evaluating AFA methods to enable their safe clinical deployment.
