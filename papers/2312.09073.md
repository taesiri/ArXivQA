# [Optimal Motion Planning using Finite Fourier Series in a Learning-based   Collision Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09073)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel motion planning method for robot manipulators called Finite Fourier Series Optimized Motion Planning (FFS-OMP), which represents continuous trajectories using Fourier series and optimizes them by adjusting the harmonics. To guide the optimization, FFS-OMP sums potential energy for collision avoidance and kinetic energy for smoothness into a Hamiltonian objective function. An adaptive interior-point method modifies the harmonics by approximating the Hessian and using exponential moving averages of gradient history. To address non-convexity in the collision field causing local minima, FFS-OMP uses a Support Vector Machine with Gaussian kernel to learn a highly convex collision field that dramatically improves success rate. Experiments validating FFS-OMP against state-of-the-art planners on 7-DOF and 6-DOF robots show much higher reliability and efficiency. Key benefits are continuous trajectory representation via Fourier series enabling easier manipulation and safer motions, as well as learning-based collision field convexification significantly overcoming local minima issues faced by numerical optimization methods.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing trajectory optimization methods for manipulators often get stuck in local optima due to the highly non-convex collision costs, leading to failure in complex environments. 
- Traditional trajectory representations using discrete waypoints can lack time-continuous safety guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent manipulator trajectory using Finite Fourier Series (FFS) which enables continuous-time safety and facilitates optimization.
- Learn a convex collision cost field using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Gaussian kernel to overcome limitations of non-convex costs. 
- Optimize FFS trajectory harmonics using an Adaptive Interior Point (AIP) method with exponential moving average gradients for stability.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces FFS trajectory representation that ensures time-continuous safety without needing mid-waypoint interpolation. Computationally more efficient.
- SVM with Gaussian kernel used to learn highly convex collision field to avoid local minima and elevate success rate.
- AIP method with damped gradient momentum allows reliable convergence to optima.  

Results:
- Experiments on 7-DOF LBR-iiwa and 6-DOF AUBO-i5 robots validate higher success rate (96.75% vs 30% for CHOMP) and computational efficiency of proposed FFS-OMP method over state-of-the-art optimization/sampling approaches.
- Learning collision field gives 158% improvement in success rate over standard AIP optimization.

In summary, the paper presents a reliable and efficient trajectory optimization technique using FFS representation, convex collision field learning and stable numerical optimization. Demonstrated to overcome limitations of prior arts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a motion planning method that represents trajectories using finite Fourier series, learns a convex collision field with support vector machines, and optimizes the Fourier coefficients using an adaptive interior-point method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel motion planning method that represents the trajectory using finite Fourier series (FFS) and optimizes the motion harmonics of each joint. This allows efficient and accurate modeling of complex trajectories. 

2) It introduces an adaptive interior-point (AIP) optimization method to modify the harmonics and descend towards an optimum. This accounts for historical gradient information to improve convergence speed and stability.

3) It leverages support vector machines (SVM) with Gaussian kernels to learn a highly convex collision field. This addresses issues with non-convexity and getting stuck in local minima during optimization. The learned collision field significantly improves planning success rates.

In summary, the key innovation is using FFS trajectory representation along with SVM-based learning of the collision field and AIP optimization. This combined approach allows efficient navigation of complex environments while avoiding local minima during motion planning. The high planning success rates demonstrated in the experiments validate the effectiveness of this method.
