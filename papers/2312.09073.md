# [Optimal Motion Planning using Finite Fourier Series in a Learning-based   Collision Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09073)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel motion planning method for robot manipulators called Finite Fourier Series Optimized Motion Planning (FFS-OMP), which represents continuous trajectories using Fourier series and optimizes them by adjusting the harmonics. To guide the optimization, FFS-OMP sums potential energy for collision avoidance and kinetic energy for smoothness into a Hamiltonian objective function. An adaptive interior-point method modifies the harmonics by approximating the Hessian and using exponential moving averages of gradient history. To address non-convexity in the collision field causing local minima, FFS-OMP uses a Support Vector Machine with Gaussian kernel to learn a highly convex collision field that dramatically improves success rate. Experiments validating FFS-OMP against state-of-the-art planners on 7-DOF and 6-DOF robots show much higher reliability and efficiency. Key benefits are continuous trajectory representation via Fourier series enabling easier manipulation and safer motions, as well as learning-based collision field convexification significantly overcoming local minima issues faced by numerical optimization methods.
