# [The Door and Drawer Reset Mechanisms: Automated Mechanisms for Testing   and Data Collection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Opening doors and drawers is challenging for robots due to variability in size, shape, actuation force required, etc. 
- Difficult to collect large real-world datasets and benchmark control algorithms on same hardware.
- No current open-source standardized testbeds and software exist for repeatable door/drawer manipulation research.

Proposed Solution:
- Present two low-cost, sensorized, automated testbeds for doors and drawers - Door Reset Mechanism (DORM) and Drawer Reset Mechanism (DWRM).
- Testbeds automatically reset/close after trials, have customizable variable resistance, and modular attachments.
- Provide open-source software for control, data collection and visualization. 
- Demonstrate testbeds with dataset of over 600 grasps using two manipulators on the testbeds.

Main Contributions:
- DORM and DWRM - Low-cost, reproducible hardware testbeds for door/drawer manipulation research
- Modular software for control and visualization
- Dataset with over 600 real-world grasp trials demonstrating testbed capabilities
- Testbeds and dataset enable future benchmarking of algorithms, training of models, etc. for improved door/drawer manipulation

The key ideas are the development of standardized testbeds to address challenges in collecting robust door/drawer manipulation datasets, along with open-source software and an initial dataset demonstrating variability even across repeats of an "identical" trial. This provides infrastructure to enable progress in learning-based solutions through availability of robust real-world data.
