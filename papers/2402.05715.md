# [Collaborative non-parametric two-sample testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05715)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of multiple two-sample testing on graphs. Specifically, given a fixed graph with nodes $v$, the goal is to test if two probability density functions (PDFs) $p_v$ and $q_v$ associated with each node are equal or not. This results in multiple hypothesis testing across the nodes of the graph. The key challenge is to leverage the graph structure to improve testing accuracy while controlling false discoveries.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new non-parametric testing framework called Collaborative Two-Sample Test (CTST) that integrates graph structure into the testing process. The key ideas are:

1) Use a collaborative likelihood ratio estimation method called GRULSIF to jointly estimate relative likelihood ratios $r_v^{\alpha}$ across all nodes. This enforces smoothness of estimates over the graph. 

2) Use the estimated $r_v^{\alpha}$ to compute node-level test statistics based on Ï†-divergence between $p_v$ and $q_v$. Two sets of statistics are used to address asymmetry.

3) Perform a permutation test using the maximum statistic to estimate node-level p-values and control family-wise error rate (FWER). The graph regularization helps make this statistic more robust under null.

4) Identify nodes where null hypothesis is rejected based on p-values.

Contributions:
- Proposes a new approach CTST that seamlessly integrates graph structure into multiple testing framework through collaborative estimation and graph smoothness.

- Introduces a permutation test tailored to leveraged properties of collaborative estimation for improved testing performance.

- Demonstrates improved accuracy over non-graph aware methods on synthetic and real seismic data. Ability to better leverage domain specific assumptions.

In summary, the key novelty is a collaborative graph-based testing approach that intertwines hypothesis testing and graph-smooth estimation of test statistics for improved accuracy.
