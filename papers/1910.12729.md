# [Towards Unsupervised Speech Recognition and Synthesis with Quantized   Speech Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12729)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn speech representations that are aligned with linguistic units like phonemes in a primarily unsupervised manner, using only a small amount of paired speech-phoneme data? The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposing a Sequential Representation Quantization AutoEncoder (SeqRQ-AE) framework that learns quantized speech representations from primarily unpaired audio data.- Using vector quantization and temporal segmentation to make the learned representations phoneme-synchronized and with a number of distinct representations close to the number of phonemes. - Demonstrating that the learned vowel representations have relative positions parallel to the IPA vowel chart defined by linguists.- Showing that with less than 20 minutes of paired data, the method outperforms prior work on phoneme recognition and synthesizing intelligible speech.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that with proper quantization and segmentation, representations that match linguistic units can be learned in a primarily unsupervised way, which is validated through experiments on speech recognition and synthesis tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called Sequential Representation Quantization AutoEncoder (SeqRQ-AE) to learn meaningful speech representations from primarily unpaired audio data. The key ideas are:- Using a sequential autoencoder to encode speech into a sequence of continuous latent vectors.- Performing vector quantization and temporal segmentation on the latent vectors to produce a sequence of discrete, phoneme-like representations. - Mapping the learned discrete representations to actual phonemes with a small amount of paired speech-phoneme data. The experiments show the learned representations capture linguistic relationships between phonemes defined by experts. The representations also enable better phoneme recognition and intelligible speech synthesis compared to prior work, when using very limited paired training data.In summary, the main contribution is developing a novel unsupervised representation learning approach that produces speech representations that are discrete, interpretable, and useful for downstream speech tasks when limited labeled data is available. The quantization and temporal segmentation appear critical to producing representations that correspond well to phonemic units.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a Sequential Representation Quantization AutoEncoder framework to learn discrete speech representations from unlabeled audio data that correspond to linguistic units like phonemes, enabling improved speech recognition and synthesis with minimal labeled data.
