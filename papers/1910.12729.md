# [Towards Unsupervised Speech Recognition and Synthesis with Quantized   Speech Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12729)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn speech representations that are aligned with linguistic units like phonemes in a primarily unsupervised manner, using only a small amount of paired speech-phoneme data? The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposing a Sequential Representation Quantization AutoEncoder (SeqRQ-AE) framework that learns quantized speech representations from primarily unpaired audio data.- Using vector quantization and temporal segmentation to make the learned representations phoneme-synchronized and with a number of distinct representations close to the number of phonemes. - Demonstrating that the learned vowel representations have relative positions parallel to the IPA vowel chart defined by linguists.- Showing that with less than 20 minutes of paired data, the method outperforms prior work on phoneme recognition and synthesizing intelligible speech.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that with proper quantization and segmentation, representations that match linguistic units can be learned in a primarily unsupervised way, which is validated through experiments on speech recognition and synthesis tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called Sequential Representation Quantization AutoEncoder (SeqRQ-AE) to learn meaningful speech representations from primarily unpaired audio data. The key ideas are:- Using a sequential autoencoder to encode speech into a sequence of continuous latent vectors.- Performing vector quantization and temporal segmentation on the latent vectors to produce a sequence of discrete, phoneme-like representations. - Mapping the learned discrete representations to actual phonemes with a small amount of paired speech-phoneme data. The experiments show the learned representations capture linguistic relationships between phonemes defined by experts. The representations also enable better phoneme recognition and intelligible speech synthesis compared to prior work, when using very limited paired training data.In summary, the main contribution is developing a novel unsupervised representation learning approach that produces speech representations that are discrete, interpretable, and useful for downstream speech tasks when limited labeled data is available. The quantization and temporal segmentation appear critical to producing representations that correspond well to phonemic units.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a Sequential Representation Quantization AutoEncoder framework to learn discrete speech representations from unlabeled audio data that correspond to linguistic units like phonemes, enabling improved speech recognition and synthesis with minimal labeled data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points on how this paper compares to other related work:- The main goal of this paper is to learn speech representations that are aligned with linguistic units like phonemes, in a primarily unsupervised manner. This is similar to other recent work like vq-wav2vec and wav2vec 2.0 that also learns discrete speech representations. - However, a key difference of this paper is the focus on learning phoneme-synchronized representations by incorporating phonetic clustering and temporal segmentation. Other methods like vq-wav2vec learn representations on the frame-level which may not align well to phonemes.- For mapping the learned representations to phonemes, this paper leverages a small amount of paired speech-phoneme data. In contrast, wav2vec 2.0 is trained in a completely self-supervised manner without any paired data.- This paper shows strong performance in ASR and TTS with limited paired data, outperforming prior approaches like dual-learning methods. This demonstrates the benefits of the learned representations, especially when annotated data is scarce.- An interesting finding is the learned vowel representations have structure similar to the IPA vowel chart designed by linguists. This provides interpretability and shows the representations capture phonetic properties. - Overall, this paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised speech representation learning that is tailored for alignment with linguistic units. The comparisons show advantages over other representation learning methods, especially in low-resource scenarios. The learned representations are more interpretable as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Leveraging unpaired text data in addition to unpaired speech data to help learn better speech representations in a more unsupervised manner. The current SeqRQ-AE framework primarily uses unpaired speech data. Incorporating unpaired text could help improve the learning.- Pursuing fully unsupervised speech recognition and synthesis using the proposed representations and framework. The current work still requires a small amount of paired speech-text data. Removing this requirement and making the system fully unsupervised is an important next step. - Improving the quantization and temporal segmentation approach to obtain representations even closer to true underlying phonemes. There is room to enhance the phonetic clustering and temporal segmentation components.- Adapting a vocoder model in the text-to-speech synthesis pipeline to improve audio quality. Currently Griffin-Lim is used which limits naturalness. - Evaluating the approach on larger and multi-speaker datasets. The current experiments are limited to a single speaker dataset. Testing on larger real-world datasets would be important.- Incorporating the learned representations into downstream speech tasks beyond recognition and synthesis, such as speaker recognition.- Analyzing the learned representations in more depth to better understand their linguistic properties.In summary, the key future directions are improving unsupervised learning, enhancing representation learning, scaling up the experiments, and applying the representations to new tasks. The authors have opened up an interesting line of research on quantized speech representation learning.
