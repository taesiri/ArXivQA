# [Attacks, Defenses and Evaluations for LLM Conversation Safety: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09283)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on attacks, defenses, and evaluations related to improving the safety of conversations with large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent studies on attacks, defenses, and evaluations related to improving the safety of conversational large language models (LLMs). The key contributions are:

1) It systematically categorizes and summarizes different attack methods that aim to elicit harmful responses from LLMs, including inference-time attacks (red-teaming, template-based attacks, neural prompt-to-prompt attacks) and training-time attacks (LLM unalignment through data poisoning). 

2) It reviews and structures defense approaches into three layers - LLM safety alignment, inference guidance, and input/output filters. This hierarchical framework represents different mechanisms to improve LLM safety.

3) It discusses evaluation methods and datasets for assessing LLM safety, outlining relevant metrics like attack success rate and dimensions like robustness, false positive rate and efficiency. 

Overall, by providing a structured overview connecting attacks, defenses and evaluations, this survey contributes to better understanding and facilitating further research towards building safe and beneficial conversational LLMs. The taxonomy and references offer a useful starting point for researchers interested in this important area.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey on attacks, defenses, and evaluations for large language model (LLM) conversation safety. Some of the key terms associated with this paper include:

- Attacks: inference-time attacks (red-team attacks, template-based attacks, neural prompt-to-prompt attacks), training-time attacks (LLM unalignment, backdoor attacks)

- Defenses: LLM safety alignment (supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback), inference guidance (system prompts, search-and-backward), input/output filters (rule-based filters, model-based filters)  

- Evaluations: safety datasets (topics like toxicity, discrimination, privacy, misinformation; formulations like red-team statements, question-answer pairs), metrics (attack success rate, robustness, false positive rate, efficiency)

In summary, this paper covers attack strategies to elicit harmful responses from LLMs, defense mechanisms to safeguard LLMs, and evaluation approaches to assess the performance of attacks and defenses - focusing specifically on the conversation safety of large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) This paper proposes a taxonomy to categorize LLM conversation safety research into attacks, defenses and evaluations. How does this taxonomy help structure research efforts and encourage further investigations? What are other potential ways to categorize this emerging field? 

2) The paper discusses different subcategories of inference-time attacks, including red-team attacks, template-based attacks and neural prompt-to-prompt attacks. How do these attack types complement each other? What are their relative strengths and limitations? 

3) Optimization-based template attacks aim to automatically discover adversarial templates rather than relying on human heuristics. What challenges exist in directly optimizing adversarial objectives for discrete text inputs? How do existing methods address these challenges?  

4) What are the key differences between training-time attacks based on model unalignment versus backdoor attacks? What vulnerabilities do they expose in current alignment and fine-tuning practices for safe conversational LLMs?

5) How does the proposed hierarchical defense framework enable a layered protection combining alignment, guidance and filtering? What are the benefits and downsides of relying solely on one type of defense mechanism?  

6) What considerations should guide the design of system prompts for inference guidance? How can prompts activate innate model capabilities while avoiding potential downsides of overly simplistic rules?

7) This survey discusses rule-based and model-based input/output filters. What are their relative advantages in detecting different types of attacks? How can they complement each other?

8) What makes collecting suitable data difficult for supervised fine-tuning approaches to LLM alignment? How do human preference based methods address these challenges? What issues remain open?

9) This paper introduces safety datasets and metrics for evaluating LLM conversation safety. What gaps exist in current benchmarks? What aspects should future datasets emphasize to enable more systematic evaluation?  

10) The survey focuses specifically on safety of conversational LLMs. What parallels exist with broader work on AI safety and interpretability? What cross-pollination of ideas could occur across these fields?
