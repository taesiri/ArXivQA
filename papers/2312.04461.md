# [PhotoMaker: Customizing Realistic Human Photos via Stacked ID Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04461)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes PhotoMaker, a method that can efficiently generate personalized human photos of high quality and preserve identity information from one or more input images. At the core of the method is a stacked ID embedding that encapsulates the identity information from multiple input images in a unified representation. This embedding is merged into the conditional text embedding and fed into the diffusion model to generate new images with the desired identity and characteristics. A key benefit is that PhotoMaker can perform identity mixing during inference, blending multiple identities to create new ones, through simple modifications of the input images or prompt weighting. The stacked embedding approach enables PhotoMaker to be fast, requiring only seconds of generation time compared to other personalization methods that require fine-tuning. Underpinning PhotoMaker is a dataset creation pipeline to construct an ID-focused corpus with high diversity, including captions with marked class words, useful for training the model. Experiments and user studies demonstrate PhotoMaker's abilities to simultaneously achieve high generation quality, ID preservation, facial diversity, text controllability, and enable a range of applications in gender/age editing, style transfer, reviving historical figures, and identity merging. The speed, fidelity, and flexibility offered by PhotoMaker is a promising development in personalized human portrait synthesis.
