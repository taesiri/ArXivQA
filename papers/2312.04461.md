# [PhotoMaker: Customizing Realistic Human Photos via Stacked ID Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04461)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes PhotoMaker, a method that can efficiently generate personalized human photos of high quality and preserve identity information from one or more input images. At the core of the method is a stacked ID embedding that encapsulates the identity information from multiple input images in a unified representation. This embedding is merged into the conditional text embedding and fed into the diffusion model to generate new images with the desired identity and characteristics. A key benefit is that PhotoMaker can perform identity mixing during inference, blending multiple identities to create new ones, through simple modifications of the input images or prompt weighting. The stacked embedding approach enables PhotoMaker to be fast, requiring only seconds of generation time compared to other personalization methods that require fine-tuning. Underpinning PhotoMaker is a dataset creation pipeline to construct an ID-focused corpus with high diversity, including captions with marked class words, useful for training the model. Experiments and user studies demonstrate PhotoMaker's abilities to simultaneously achieve high generation quality, ID preservation, facial diversity, text controllability, and enable a range of applications in gender/age editing, style transfer, reviving historical figures, and identity merging. The speed, fidelity, and flexibility offered by PhotoMaker is a promising development in personalized human portrait synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces PhotoMaker, an efficient personalized text-to-image generation method that can generate high-quality and diverse human portraits with strong identity preservation from just a few example images of a person.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing PhotoMaker, an efficient personalized text-to-image generation method that can generate high-quality and diverse human portraits with strong identity fidelity using just a feedforward pass. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a stacked identity (ID) embedding that fuses embeddings from multiple input ID images into a unified representation. This allows comprehensively preserving ID information for fidelity while allowing flexibility like mixing identities.

2) Designing an ID-oriented data construction pipeline to build a dataset with multiple images per ID to facilitate training the proposed PhotoMaker.

3) Demonstrating PhotoMaker's ability to generate human portraits with simultaneous high efficiency, quality, diversity, editability, and identity fidelity. It also enables applications like identity mixing, gender/age changing, and bringing old portraits to life.

4) Providing strong personalized text-to-image generation baselines with both the proposed method and dataset that could inspire more research into ID-conditional generation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an effective and efficient framework PhotoMaker that can generate high-fidelity and customizable human portraits using a feedforward pass. The stacked ID embedding and tailored dataset are also important enablers of this contribution.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing personalized image generation methods for synthesizing realistic human photos have limitations in simultaneously achieving high efficiency, identity (ID) fidelity, text controllability, and generation diversity. Methods requiring test-time tuning like DreamBooth are slow. Single image embedding methods lack ID comprehensiveness and fidelity.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes PhotoMaker, an efficient feed-forward framework that takes multiple ID images as input and generates customized high-quality human portraits in a single forward pass. The key idea is representing the multiple ID images as a stacked ID embedding which comprehensively captures ID characteristics. This embedding replaces the class token in the text embedding and is merged through cross-attention layers. 

The paper also proposes an automated pipeline to construct an ID-centric dataset of human images with varying poses, attributes and backgrounds per ID. This facilitates training the PhotoMaker.

Main Contributions:
- PhotoMaker framework that takes multiple ID images as input and efficiently generates customized, high-fidelity and controllable human portraits using stacked ID embeddings.

- Automated pipeline to construct large-scale ID-centric dataset of human images with textual descriptions to train personalized generation models.

- PhotoMaker combines the ID fidelity of tuning-based methods with the efficiency of embedding methods, allowing recontextualization, age/gender change, artwork to photo translation, identity mixing etc.

- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates PhotoMaker's superiority over state-of-the-arts like DreamBooth and embedding-based methods in efficiency, quality, ID fidelity, text controllability and facial diversity.
