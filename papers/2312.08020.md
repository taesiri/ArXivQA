# [Generalized Deepfakes Detection with Reconstructed-Blended Images and   Multi-scale Feature Reconstruction Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08020)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deepfake detection approach combining a reconstructed blended image (RBI) generation method and a multi-scale feature reconstruction network (MFRN). The RBI method enhances the diversity of simulated manipulation artifacts in training data by disentangling and reconstructing facial images to incorporate invisible generator fingerprints and noise patterns. MFRN is designed to exploit the rich annotations in RBIs by extracting and fusing RGB, edge, and noise features across scales to reconstruct boundaries and regions. Experiments demonstrate superior cross-manipulation and cross-dataset detection performance on unseen Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap, NeuralTextures and FaceShifter manipulations. The model achieves 100% and 99.92% AUCs on DF and FF++ unseen test sets respectively for cross-manipulation detection. For cross-dataset testing, it substantially outperforms baselines on CDF-v2, DFD and DFDC. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of both the RBI generation process and the components within the MFRN architecture. Additional visualization confirms the model's ability to accurately localize manipulated regions on diverse unseen manipulations.
