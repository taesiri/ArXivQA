# [Contrastive Diffuser: Planning Towards High Return States via   Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02772)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent offline RL methods have incorporated diffusion models for long-term planning and shown effectiveness. These methods leverage the diffusion model to generate the distribution of subsequent trajectories (called the base distribution) and apply classifier guidance over this distribution to obtain high-return trajectories for planning. However, they are limited by:
1) Their base distributions stay close to the dataset distribution, making them sensitive to suboptimal samples in datasets. 
2) They overlook the diversity of samples - different states can have very different returns.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel method called Contrastive Diffuser (CDiffuser) to improve the base distribution. It introduces a return contrast mechanism to pull the states in generated trajectories towards high-return states while pushing them away from low-return states. Specifically:

1) It groups states into high-return (positive) and low-return (negative) sets in a soft manner using improved influence functions.

2) It learns a trajectory generation model with contrastive learning to make the states in generated trajectories align with positive states and stay away from negative states. This enhances the base distribution.

3) It optimizes from the perspective of trajectory generation, return prediction and trajectory generation constraint.

Main Contributions:

(1) Proposes CDiffuser method which novelty improves base distribution of diffusion RL via contrast learning for superior performance.

(2) Introduces return contrast mechanism over states to enhance base distribution. First work to apply contrastive learning this way in diffusion RL.  

(3) Evaluated on 14 D4RL benchmarks. Results demonstrate outstanding performance of CDiffuser over strong baselines. Ablations further validate the efficacy of the proposed contrastive mechanism.
