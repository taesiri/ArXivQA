# [Improvement in Variational Quantum Algorithms by Measurement   Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06176)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method called "Measurement Simplification" to simplify the expression for measuring the output of quantum circuits used in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). By simplifying the measurement expression, the computation time and memory requirements can be dramatically reduced when only partial information about the quantum state is needed to evaluate the VQA cost function and optimization. The authors apply Measurement Simplification to circuits used in various VQAs like quantum deep reinforcement learning, variational quantum linear solver, variational quantum eigensolver for quantum chemistry, and quantum machine learning. In these applications, the size of the measurement expressions was reduced by 3x to 10,000x after simplification. Specifically, for a variational quantum linear solver implementation, a 56x speedup in computation time was demonstrated after applying Measurement Simplification. Given the potential for very large improvements in speed and memory usage, Measurement Simplification could have broad applicability in efficiently executing VQAs on near-term quantum devices.
