# [Boarding for ISS: Imbalanced Self-Supervised: Discovery of a Scaled   Autoencoder for Mixed Tabular Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) with autoencoders has shown success for images/text but faces challenges for tabular/mixed data. 
- Using standard loss functions like MSE with one-hot encoded categories can be problematic when categories are imbalanced. The loss function favors reconstructing majority categories over minority ones.
- This imbalanced influence exists between categories of a variable and also across categorical vs numeric variables.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a balanced Multi-Supervised MSE (SAM) loss to handle imbalanced mixed data in SSL framework. 
- It reweights per-category errors by their frequencies to equalize influence. Also normalizes categorical variable errors by number of categories.
- Allows autoencoder (Scaled AutoEncoder for Mixed data) to focus on reconstructing all categories rather than just majority ones.

Contributions:
- Identify and analyze issues with using MSE loss for imbalanced self-supervised learning on mixed tabular data
- Propose adapted balanced MSE loss function to handle imbalance 
- Show improved reconstruction and prediction performance empirically across simulated and multiple real datasets
- Demonstrate applicability in supervised, unsupervised and generative settings like VAEs

Key Benefits:
- Handles mixed categorical/numerical data effectively in SSL models like autoencoders
- Improves learning on minority categories which often contain critical information
- Avoids creating spurious correlations which disrupt downstream tasks
- Simple plug-in loss function amenable to various models/architectures


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a balanced multi-supervised mean squared error loss function to address the challenges of learning imbalanced categorical data with autoencoders for mixed tabular datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

i) understanding and analyzing the drawbacks of using MSE as a loss function for autoencoders on mixed tabular data, especially when the data is imbalanced; 

ii) proposing a balanced multi-supervised MSE that adapts for mixed tabular data, especially when data are imbalanced; 

iii) illustrating the differences between the standard MSE and the proposed balanced MSE through a simple simulation and experiments on multiple real datasets in various supervised, unsupervised and generative contexts.

The key idea is that the standard MSE loss function tends to favor learning majority categories and variables when data is imbalanced. To address this, the authors propose a new balanced MSE loss that reweights the errors to give equal influence to all categories and variables during learning. They show this performs better than standard MSE when learning is insufficient due to complexity or iterations.

The paper proposes a novel balanced MSE loss function for autoencoders handling mixed tabular data, especially in contexts where the data is imbalanced. It analyzes issues with using standard MSE loss for imbalanced categorical variables, and shows empirically that the proposed balanced MSE can improve reconstruction and prediction when learning is insufficient, while performing similarly otherwise. Key terms like "Imbalanced Self-Supervised Learning", "Mixed Tabular Data", "Scaled Autoencoder", and "Balanced MSE" are central to characterizing the key focus and contributions of this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new loss function called "Balanced MSE" to handle imbalanced categorical variables in autoencoders for tabular data. How exactly does this loss function balance the influence of majority and minority categories compared to standard MSE?

2. One of the key claims is that standard MSE tends to focus more on reconstructing majority categories while ignoring minority ones. Can you explain the mathematical intuition behind why this occurs? 

3. The balanced accuracy metric is used to evaluate reconstruction of categorical variables. How is this metric formulated and why is it more suitable than standard accuracy for imbalanced categories?

4. For mixed tabular data, the paper argues that cross-entropy exhibits similar drawbacks to MSE in handling imbalanced categories. What is the reasoning behind why cross-entropy also favors majority classes?  

5. How does the proposed Balanced MSE handle the relative influence between categorical variables with differing numbers of categories compared to standard MSE?

6. The paper focuses on analyzing autoencoders, but do you think the issues identified and the Balanced MSE solution could be extended to other self-supervised frameworks like contrastive learning? Why or why not?

7. What are some potential limitations or drawbacks of using a Balanced MSE loss for minority categories? When might balancing categories not be optimal?

8. How was the relative weighting between numerical and categorical errors in Balanced MSE formulated? Why is this appropriate?

9. For mixed data, what other loss functions could potentially be proposed to handle imbalanced categories besides Balanced MSE?

10. The results show Balanced MSE helps for insufficient learning, but gives similar results for ample complexity/iterations. What does this imply about the method and its usefulness?
