# [Boarding for ISS: Imbalanced Self-Supervised: Discovery of a Scaled   Autoencoder for Mixed Tabular Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) with autoencoders has shown success for images/text but faces challenges for tabular/mixed data. 
- Using standard loss functions like MSE with one-hot encoded categories can be problematic when categories are imbalanced. The loss function favors reconstructing majority categories over minority ones.
- This imbalanced influence exists between categories of a variable and also across categorical vs numeric variables.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a balanced Multi-Supervised MSE (SAM) loss to handle imbalanced mixed data in SSL framework. 
- It reweights per-category errors by their frequencies to equalize influence. Also normalizes categorical variable errors by number of categories.
- Allows autoencoder (Scaled AutoEncoder for Mixed data) to focus on reconstructing all categories rather than just majority ones.

Contributions:
- Identify and analyze issues with using MSE loss for imbalanced self-supervised learning on mixed tabular data
- Propose adapted balanced MSE loss function to handle imbalance 
- Show improved reconstruction and prediction performance empirically across simulated and multiple real datasets
- Demonstrate applicability in supervised, unsupervised and generative settings like VAEs

Key Benefits:
- Handles mixed categorical/numerical data effectively in SSL models like autoencoders
- Improves learning on minority categories which often contain critical information
- Avoids creating spurious correlations which disrupt downstream tasks
- Simple plug-in loss function amenable to various models/architectures
