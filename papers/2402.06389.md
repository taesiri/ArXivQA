# [Human Aesthetic Preference-Based Large Text-to-Image Model   Personalization: Kandinsky Generation as an Example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06389)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large text-to-image models like DALL-E can generate aesthetic images from text prompts, but the prompting process is tedious trial-and-error for users to get desired results. 
- The text embedding space cannot precisely reconstruct user preferences. The interaction paradigm is more suitable for models than human intuition.
- There is a need to control the non-determinism in a principled way to generate customized image content aligned with user aesthetic preferences.

Proposed Solution:
- Customize a text-to-image model for a specific artistic style using "semantic injection", which encodes discrete and continuous attribute values into the model. This results in an "artist model".
- Apply a genetic algorithm with human aesthetic evaluation as feedback to iteratively optimize prompting. This evolves the prompting model to align with user preferences.
- Combine the optimized prompting model with artist model to create a personalized text-to-image model tailored to user preferences without needing further prompts.

Contributions:
- A generative approach to automatically create personalized painterly images based on user aesthetic preferences in a customized artistic style, without needing explicit prompting.
- Constructed a dataset of Kandinsky Bauhaus style images and text descriptions to showcase the proposed techniques.
- Showed semantic injection can effectively incorporate artistic style into text-to-image models.
- Demonstrated genetic prompting optimization with human feedback can evolve prompts tailored to user preferences.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage semantic injection and evolutionary optimization to create personalized text-to-image models aligned with user aesthetic preferences for generating customized artistic content without tedious prompting.
