# Exploring the Intersection of Large Language Models and Agent-Based   Modeling via Prompt Engineering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT be used to create agent-based simulations that can model complex human interactions and emergent social behaviors?The key goals and contributions outlined in the introduction relate to this overarching research question, including:- Providing examples of LLM-driven simulations that allow exploring outcomes by adjusting agent personas. - Categorizing LLM simulations into one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many types.- Discussing limitations around context window size in building large-scale, human-realistic simulations.So in summary, the main research thrust appears to be using LLMs to create agent-based simulations that can capture nuanced human behaviors and interactions, which has been difficult to achieve with traditional simulation techniques. The authors explore this through simple example simulations using prompt engineering and by outlining challenges that need to be overcome to build more complex and large-scale human-realistic simulations using LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating how large language models (LLMs) can be used to simulate believable human interactions through prompt engineering. Specifically, the paper presents two examples of LLM-driven simulations:1) A two-agent negotiation simulation where LLM agents haggle over the price of a Pokemon card. By adjusting the objectives in each agent's persona, this shows how the outcome of the negotiation can change.2) A six-agent simulation where LLM agents try to solve a murder mystery through questioning. This demonstrates a "one-to-many" interaction and uses a memory stream to help the captain agent maintain context across responses.Additionally, the paper categorizes LLM simulations into one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many types. It also discusses limitations around the context window size and long-term memory retrieval.In summary, the key contribution is using prompt engineering to create simulated social interactions between LLM agents that exhibit complex, human-like behavior. This enables researchers to explore outcomes in social systems by adjusting agent personas.
