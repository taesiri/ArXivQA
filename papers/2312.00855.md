# [Refine, Discriminate and Align: Stealing Encoders via Sample-Wise   Prototypes and Multi-Relational Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00855)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for stealing self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders have two key deficiencies: 1) suboptimal performance due to biased optimization objectives, and 2) high query costs due to the end-to-end training paradigm. 

Proposed Solution (RDA - Refine, Discriminate and Align):
1) Refine target encoder representations for each sample via a sample-wise prototype that aggregates embeddings from multiple perspectives. This establishes a less biased optimization target.

2) Discriminate between mismatched embedding-prototype pairs via a contrastive loss while aligning matched pairs in terms of both amplitude and angle. This multi-relational extraction loss enhances attack efficacy.

3) RDA requires exponentially fewer queries than end-to-end approaches as prototypes are generated upfront to guide subsequent query-free training.

Key Contributions:
- Develops the concept of sample-wise prototypes to mitigate biased optimizations when stealing SSL encoders.
- Introduces a multi-relational loss that trains the surrogate encoder to discriminate and align in terms of both angle and amplitude.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across datasets with over 99% reduction in queries compared to prior art.
- Demonstrates robustness against multiple common defense strategies such as noise injection and watermarking.

In summary, RDA pioneers more accurate and economical approaches for stealing SSL encoders via refined optimization objectives and tailored multi-relational losses. Extensive experiments verify remarkable efficacy and robustness improvements across diverse settings.
