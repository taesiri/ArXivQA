# [Towards Personalized Evaluation of Large Language Models with An   Anonymous Crowd-Sourcing Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08305)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) have limitations:
  - Focus mainly on assessing performance on objective questions, overlooking capability for subjective questions
  - Depend too much on centralized datasets, lacking real-world decentralized problems 
  - Do not adequately consider integrating personalized user data and contexts

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new crowdsourcing platform called BingJian for evaluating LLMs
  - Supports both centralized and decentralized evaluations
  - Users can submit personalized questions to test models on broader capabilities
  - Employs competitive scoring where users rank model responses 
  - Collects comprehensive user personalization data 
- Aim to uncover relationships between human evaluators and LLM performances

Key Contributions:
- Designed an open, crowdsourced platform that can accumulate wide variety of evaluation data through human-computer interactions
- Incorporates an ELO rating system to adjust model scores based on evaluation outcomes
- Analysis of personalized user data provides insights on how individual characteristics influence assessments
- Enables customized and adaptive evaluations that account for user preferences and contexts
- Platform and analysis methodologies can drive advancements in LLMs to better mirror human cognition

In summary, the paper proposed an innovative personalized crowdsourcing platform to evaluate LLMs in a broader, nuanced way that integrates human subjectivity into the process. The ultimate goal is to gain deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and tailor them to different users.
