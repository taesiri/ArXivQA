# [Towards Personalized Evaluation of Large Language Models with An   Anonymous Crowd-Sourcing Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08305)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) have limitations:
  - Focus mainly on assessing performance on objective questions, overlooking capability for subjective questions
  - Depend too much on centralized datasets, lacking real-world decentralized problems 
  - Do not adequately consider integrating personalized user data and contexts

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new crowdsourcing platform called BingJian for evaluating LLMs
  - Supports both centralized and decentralized evaluations
  - Users can submit personalized questions to test models on broader capabilities
  - Employs competitive scoring where users rank model responses 
  - Collects comprehensive user personalization data 
- Aim to uncover relationships between human evaluators and LLM performances

Key Contributions:
- Designed an open, crowdsourced platform that can accumulate wide variety of evaluation data through human-computer interactions
- Incorporates an ELO rating system to adjust model scores based on evaluation outcomes
- Analysis of personalized user data provides insights on how individual characteristics influence assessments
- Enables customized and adaptive evaluations that account for user preferences and contexts
- Platform and analysis methodologies can drive advancements in LLMs to better mirror human cognition

In summary, the paper proposed an innovative personalized crowdsourcing platform to evaluate LLMs in a broader, nuanced way that integrates human subjectivity into the process. The ultimate goal is to gain deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and tailor them to different users.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes BingJian, an anonymous crowd-sourcing platform for evaluating large language models that allows both centralized and decentralized evaluations while analyzing correlations between model responses and user profiles.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new crowdsourcing platform called BingJian for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Some key aspects of BingJian that highlight its main contributions:

1) It allows both centralized and decentralized evaluations of LLMs. It has a constructed question bank for centralized evaluation, but also allows users to input custom questions for decentralized evaluation. This provides more diverse and unbiased testing of LLMs.

2) It incorporates a competitive scoring mechanism where users can rank LLM responses anonymously. This facilitates fair comparisons between different models. 

3) It collects comprehensive user profile data to enable analysis of personalized LLM evaluation results. This allows studying the correlation between user backgrounds and their assessments of LLMs.

4) It employs visualization and analysis of the crowdsourced evaluation data to provide insights into model capabilities across various metrics and user groups. This supports better understanding and improvement of LLMs.

In summary, the main highlight is a personalized and anonymous crowdsourcing platform for evaluating LLMs in a diverse, unbiased, and insightful way to drive advancements in this rapidly evolving field. The analysis of personalized evaluation results is also a key contribution.
