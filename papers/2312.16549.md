# [How Robust are LLMs to In-Context Majority Label Bias?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper investigates the robustness of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) to shifts in label distribution, referred to as "majority label bias". 
- Previous works showed ICL is susceptible to such biases, but did not fully examine model performance across varying class proportions.
- Understanding model robustness to skewed label distributions is important since real-world data often contains inherent biases.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a comprehensive study on LLMs' robustness boundaries to majority label bias using public text classification datasets. 
- Vary distribution of labels in the prompt from balanced to highly skewed.
- Compare multiple model sizes (7B to 40B parameters) and effect of adding task instructions.
- Define a "Robustness Boundary" metric to quantify tolerance.

Key Contributions:
- Contrary to claims about lack of robustness, LLMs show resilience with Robustness Boundary of 80-100% for binary classification.  
- Larger models and task instructions further improve robustness.
- Performance degrades significantly for multi-class problems.
- Study provides guidance on model selection and prompt design strategies when dealing with biased data.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how robust different LLMs are to skewed label distributions during in-context learning for text classification tasks. The key findings highlight model capabilities and limitations that can inform real-world deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the robustness of in-context learning in large language models to majority label bias in text classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It conducts a comprehensive study on the robustness boundaries of in-context learning using pre-trained LLMs to majority label bias. The findings shed light on the model's performance under varying distributional conditions in the prompts.

2) It provides ablations showing the effect of model sizes and the impact of adding informative instruction prompts on model robustness to majority label bias. The results show that larger LLMs and prompts with instructions improve robustness.

3) It introduces a new metric called "Robustness Boundary" (RB@K) to quantify model robustness to majority label bias. This captures how often the model performance remains within K% of the peak performance under different label distributions.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that contrary to some prior findings, LLMs can be robust to moderate amounts of majority label bias especially with larger models and instructional prompts. The RB@K metric is also useful for quantifying this.

- Text classification (TC)
- Majority label bias
- Model robustness
- Instructional prompts
- Parameter efficiency
- Distribution shifts
- Model generalization

The paper studies the robustness of in-context learning in large language models for text classification tasks under varying degrees of majority label bias. It examines how performance varies across different model sizes and with the addition of instructional prompts. The key goals are assessing model robustness boundaries and providing guidance on deploying LLMs reliably despite biases that may exist in real-world data. Relevant concepts include mitigating distribution shifts and improving model generalization. Overall, the central themes have to do with understanding and overcomingbiases in LLMs for reliable in-context learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper studies robustness of in-context learning in large language models to majority label bias. Could the authors elaborate more on why studying this specific form of bias is important? What kinds of real-world issues could arise if models are not robust to it?

2. The concept of "robustness boundary" quantified using the RB@K metric is introduced. How was the choice of K=10% arrived at? Would the conclusions change if a different K value was chosen instead? 

3. The paper finds that model robustness to majority label bias improves with increase in model size. Is there a theoretical explanation for why this might be happening? Or are there certain architectural attributes of larger models that might account for this?

4. Does the relative robustness between models of the same size (e.g. OpenAI vs Anthropic) suggest anything about the impact of different pre-training objectives/datasets?

5. The drop in robustness for multi-class classification tasks is an interesting finding. What factors inherent to multi-class problems might account for this reduced robustness?  

6. For the w/ instruction vs w/o instruction experiments, what might explain the more pronounced impact of instructions for larger models? Is it possible to theoretically quantify this relationship?

7. The paper studies the impact of label distribution shifts. How do the findings compare if instead of label shifts, data distribution shifts are introduced? Would the conclusions still hold?

8. Real-world data often has more complex distributional shifts than simple majority label biases. How could the analysis approach proposed here be extended to account for more complex shifts?

9. The study focuses on text classification tasks. Would these findings generalize to other modalities and tasks? What differences might be expected?

10. What other forms of dataset biases could impact model robustness? Can the analysis approach used here apply to studying robustness to other biases as well?
