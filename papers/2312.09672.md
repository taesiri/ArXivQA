# [InstructPipe: Building Visual Programming Pipelines with Human   Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09672)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing visual programming systems require users to build pipelines entirely from scratch, starting with an empty workspace. Users need to select appropriate nodes, conceive the pipeline structure, and connect nodes themselves. This process can be challenging and overwhelming for novice users.

Proposed Solution - InstructPipe:
The paper proposes InstructPipe, an AI assistant that allows users to build machine learning pipelines by providing text instructions. InstructPipe has two key components:

1. Two LLM modules that generate pseudocode for the target pipeline based on user instructions:
   - Node Selector: Selects relevant nodes from the system's library
   - Code Writer: Generates pseudocode using the selected nodes

2. A Code Interpreter that compiles the pseudocode into a runnable pipeline and renders it in the visual programming interface for further interaction.

Key Contributions:
1. Allows users to build ML pipelines from human instructions, reducing workload
2. System design and implementation of InstructPipe's components
3. Evaluations showing InstructPipe reduces user interactions by 81.1% and significantly improves user experience

The paper discusses how InstructPipe facilitates prototype development, reduces technical barriers for novices, and sparks innovative ideas through open-ended commands. Challenges related to user mental models and debugging code are analyzed. Future directions around an online version of InstructPipe are explored.
