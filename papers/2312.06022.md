# [Exploiting Representation Bias for Data Distillation in Abstractive Text   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Abstractive text summarization models rely on large datasets to learn representations between source text and target summaries. However, blindly increasing dataset size does not consistently improve performance.  
- Current models fail to capture diversity of input space, generating repetitive, templatic summaries. Skewed data representations causes models to ignore variable examples as noise.
- This representation bias in datasets inhibits model generalization across genres.

Methodology:
- Analyze training dynamics of various abstractive summarization models by clustering embedding & encoder vector spaces.
- Find embeddings show some variability but get mapped to saturated encoder space regardless of model type.
- Indicates models learn similar weights, outputting repetitive summaries despite differing inputs.  

Key Contributions:
- Quantify representation bias in datasets by studying how models map from input to encoder space.
- Filter redundant samples using hierarchical clustering to retain only critical data points.
- Show subsampled 10K instances can match performance of models trained on full dataset.
- Subsampling makes models more generalizable, easier to train and enhances qualitative metrics like faithfulness. 
- Benchmark against various datasets and model types like LSTM, Transformers.
- Provide insights into how bias inhibits performance and generalization.

The paper offers a novel analysis to identify core weaknesses in existing summarization techniques. It makes important contributions in devising data-efficient methods to reduce repetition and improve faithfulness without sacrificing performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper characterizes representation bias in abstractive text summarization datasets that causes models to generate repetitive and unfaithful summaries, proposes a metric to filter redundant data points to improve model robustness and data efficiency, and shows improved performance on quantitative and qualitative metrics with much less training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are four-fold:

1. The authors explore the representation bias in summarization datasets during training by studying the training dynamics of six widely-used deep learning based summarization systems. 

2. They devise a metric to filter out redundant data samples that directly affect the performance of summarization systems.

3. They assess the quality of the filtered data points by benchmarking the performance of summarization systems quantitatively and qualitatively on various metrics. 

4. They analyze the biases reflected by the dataset during training and inference to reason about what causes deep learning based summarization systems to generate unfaithful, hallucinative, and repetitive summaries.

So in summary, the paper identifies and characterizes representation bias in summarization training data, proposes a method to filter redundant samples, shows this improves performance, and provides analysis about why current summarization systems struggle with faithfulness and diversity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Abstractive text summarization
- Representation bias
- Data distillation 
- Embedding space
- Encoder space
- Training dynamics
- Generalizability
- Faithfulness
- Clustering
- Redundant data 
- Quantitative metrics (e.g. Rouge)
- Qualitative metrics (e.g. BERTScore, FEQA, Pyramid score)

The paper explores representation bias in abstractive text summarization models and how it affects their performance and generalizability. It studies the training dynamics at the embedding and encoder levels to understand this bias. The authors use clustering techniques to identify and filter out redundant training data points to make the models more robust and less data-hungry. They benchmark the filtered data on various quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics. So the key terms revolve around studying and mitigating representation bias to improve summarization systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a method to characterize and exploit representation bias in abstractive text summarization models. Can you explain in detail the steps involved in characterizing the representation bias? What metrics and visualizations are used?

2. The paper studies representation bias at both the embedding space and encoder space of summarization models. What differences did the authors observe between LSTM-based and Transformer-based models in terms of diversity of representations learned?

3. The paper employs hierarchical clustering to identify and remove redundant/similar data points. Explain the complete workflow of how the clusters and sub-clusters are created. What is the intuition behind sorting data points within each sub-cluster? 

4. How exactly is the filtered, sub-sampled dataset created for retraining the models? What percentage of the full dataset is used for the three benchmark datasets? What impact does this sub-sampling have on quantitative evaluation metrics?

5. The authors claim that excessive data does not necessarily improve summarization quality and limited, diverse data is sufficient. Based on the results, do you agree? Why or why not? What evidence supports or contradicts this claim?

6. What insights do the authors provide from their analysis regarding model generalization, impact of diversity in training data, exploiting biases for performance improvement etc? Critically analyze one of these discussion points.

7. While the method shows improved quantitative scores, what additional qualitative evaluations could be done to further validate the usefulness of the proposed data filtering technique?

8. The authors identify repetition, hallucination and unfaithfulness as key issues in summarization. How well does the proposed method address these issues? What limitations exist?

9. The technique is evaluated only on summarization. What are other NLP tasks where a similar characterization and mitigation of representation bias would be meaningful to explore?

10. The paper identifies dataset bias as a key factor influencing model bias. What techniques can complement the proposed data filtering approach to make models more robust to biased datasets?
