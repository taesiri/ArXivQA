# [Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning for Answering   Knowledge-intensive Complex Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13982)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ProbTree, a novel approach for answering complex questions that requires multi-hop reasoning. It first translates the question into a query tree, where the root is the original question and child nodes are sub-questions. Then reasoning is conducted from leaf nodes to root in a probabilistic way by considering three QA modules: Child-aggregating QA that reasons with child question-answer pairs, Open-book QA that reasons with retrieved knowledge, and Closed-book QA that uses implicit knowledge. For each node, the most confident answer from the three modules is selected. Compared to chain-based reasoning methods, ProbTree's tree structure provides broader sight and flexibility to recover from errors. It also integrates external and implicit knowledge effectively by selecting the most reliable answer. Experiments using GPT-3 on HotpotQA, MuSiQue and 2WikiMultihopQA show ProbTree achieving new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the efficacy of tree-based probabilistic reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning approach for answering complex questions that brings uncertainty into reasoning, integrates parametric and external knowledge, and conducts reasoning over a query tree to eliminate issues like negative retrieval and error propagation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work include:

1) Proposing a novel approach called Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning (ProbTree) for answering complex questions. This approach represents the information need using a tree structure and conducts probabilistic reasoning over the tree to solve questions from leaf nodes to the root.

2) Bringing uncertainty into reasoning by quantifying answer confidence based on the likelihood of the explanation. This allows integrating external knowledge retrieved online and implicit knowledge in model parameters in a unified framework.

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of ProbTree on three complex QA datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly. The results prove the effect of tree-based reasoning and probabilistic knowledge integration.

In summary, the key innovation is leveraging the tree structure to enable more flexible reasoning, as well as leveraging model confidence to integrate multiple knowledge sources. Both contribute to the superior performance over existing chain-based reasoning approaches.

The paper proposes a probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning approach called ProbTree to improve answering of knowledge-intensive complex questions. It constructs a query tree to represent the reasoning structure and performs reasoning over this tree to solve questions from leaf to root nodes. The confidence scores help choose the best answer between closed-book QA, open-book QA, and child-aggregating QA. Experiments on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets demonstrate significant improvements.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought Reasoning (ProbTree) method proposed in the paper:

1. How does ProbTree address the issue of negative retrieval compared to previous chain-based reasoning methods? Explain the role of closed-book QA and open-book QA in eliminating this issue.

2. Explain how the tree structure in ProbTree helps address the issue of error propagation and limited sight compared to chain-based reasoning methods. How does the hierarchical structure provide more flexibility? 

3. What is the motivation behind using the conditional probability of the language model to calculate the decomposing score $ds^i$? How does this indicate the model's confidence in the question decomposition?

4. Explain the equation used to calculate the confidence score $s^i_{ca}$ for the child-aggregating QA module. Why is the confidence score dependent on both the explanation likelihoods and confidence scores of child nodes? 

5. How does ProbTree determine which QA module (child-aggregating, open-book, closed-book) provides the optimal answer for a given query tree node? Explain the role of confidence scores in making this determination.

6. What hypotheses does the paper make about language model behavior that enables using explanation likelihoods as an indicator of answer confidence? Do you think these hypotheses are reasonable?

7. How could ProbTree be extended to incorporate other structured knowledge sources beyond unstructured text documents? What additional QA modules might need to be added?

8. What are some key limitations of relying on large language models as the backend for ProbTree? How could these limitations be addressed in future work? 

9. Why can the query tree representation be more effective for information retrieval compared to using only the last chain-of-thought reasoning step? Explain the differences.  

10. How does tool learning play a role in ProbTree? What specialized tools does the method leverage and what is the higher-level task it accomplishes?
