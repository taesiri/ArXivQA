# [A new fuzzy multi-attribute group decision-making method based on TOPSIS   and optimization models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15933)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new fuzzy multi-attribute group decision-making method based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, optimization models, and an improved TOPSIS method. Specifically, it extends a previous expert weight optimization model to determine expert weights by maximizing consistency between individual expert evaluations and overall consistent evaluations. It also establishes an attribute weight optimization model to maximize the closeness index of each alternative. By combining these optimization models with an improved TOPSIS method, it develops a complete algorithm that gives full play to subjective and objective weighting methods for determining expert and attribute weights. A case study of selecting the optimal medical treatment demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method by showing consistent decision-making results compared to a previous method while having more convincing expert weights. The paper provides a reliable fuzzy group decision-making approach with practical significance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new fuzzy multi-attribute group decision-making method that combines optimization models for determining expert and attribute weights with an improved TOPSIS method based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a complete fuzzy multi-attribute group decision-making method by:

1) Extending the optimization model for determining expert weights proposed by Liu et al. (2021) to the environment of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. This allows determining expert weights by combining subjective and objective methods.

2) Combining the extended expert weight determination method with the improved TOPSIS method proposed by Ting-Yu (2020) for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy setting. 

3) Proposing an optimization model for determining attribute weights that incorporates both objective information and subjective expert opinions. 

4) Integrating all these methods into a complete algorithm that utilizes interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets for handling uncertainty, optimization models for determining weights, and the improved TOPSIS method for ranking alternatives.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a comprehensive fuzzy multi-attribute group decision-making framework that gives full play to both subjective and objective methods for weight determination and is able to effectively handle problems with uncertain and imprecise information. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study.
