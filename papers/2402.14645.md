# [Sparse Linear Regression and Lattice Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14645)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies the fundamental problem of sparse linear regression (SLR), where given a design matrix X and response vector y, the goal is to find a sparse vector θ that minimizes the prediction error ||Xθ - y||. 

- Specifically, the paper investigates which design matrices X admit efficient SLR algorithms. Prior works show algorithms like Lasso succeed when X is well-conditioned, but it is unclear if Lasso is optimal for all X.

- The paper asks: is Lasso the best possible SLR algorithm for all design matrices X? More broadly, which X matrices are "easy" or "hard" for SLR?

Main Results:

1. The paper shows a reduction from the bounded distance decoding (BDD) problem on lattices to SLR. Specifically, for a BDD instance defined by a lattice basis B, the reduction outputs an SLR instance with design matrix X drawn from a Gaussian distribution dependent on B.

2. If there is an SLR algorithm that beats Lasso in terms of dependence on the restricted eigenvalue condition, then there is an algorithm that beats lattice decoding via Babai's algorithm. In this sense, "beating Lasso implies beating Babai".

3. The reduction shows average-case hardness for SLR under worst-case lattice assumptions. The resulting X matrices are ill-conditioned but the SLR instances are still information-theoretically solvable.

4. For well-conditioned Gaussian X, the paper shows hardness of SLR in the unidentifiable setting even when there are polynomially many samples, assuming hardness of the continuous LWE problem.

Key Contributions:

- First connection shown between SLR and lattice problems. This allows translating average-case hardness from lattices to SLR.

- Shows a family of design matrices X for which SLR provably hard, depending on the believed hardness of BDD lattices.

- Reduction preserves fine-grained complexity, giving SLR hardness results for sub-exponential time algorithms.

- Opens up questions about using lattice algorithms like LLL for preconditioning to get better SLR algorithms. More broadly, opens up a new connection between lattices and statistical estimation.
