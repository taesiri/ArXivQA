## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TASFAR, a novel target-agnostic source-free domain adaptation approach for regression tasks. The key idea is to estimate the label distribution of the target domain using the prediction confidence of a source model on confident target data. This label distribution is represented as a density map and used to generate pseudo-labels for uncertain target data. Specifically, a confidence classifier splits target data into confident and uncertain sets. Then, a label distribution estimator constructs the density map based on the prediction and uncertainty of confident data. Next, a pseudo-label generator leverages the density map to assign pseudo-labels and credibility scores to uncertain data. Finally, the pseudo-labeled uncertain data fine-tunes the source model into the target model via supervised learning. Extensive experiments on pedestrian dead reckoning, crowd counting, and prediction tasks demonstrate that without any source data, TASFAR significantly outperforms prior source-free methods and achieves comparable accuracy to source-based domain adaptation. The proposed usage of label distribution is a promising direction for target-agnostic, source-free regression adaptation.
