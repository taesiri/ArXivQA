# [OS-Copilot: Towards Generalist Computer Agents with Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07456)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing digital agents are designed for narrow domains and struggle to effectively interact with the heterogeneous operating system (OS) ecosystem comprising of diverse applications. 
- There is a lack of exploration around developing language agents that can interact with the entire OS instead of just individual applications. This presents two key challenges: (1) lack of a unified interface for agent-OS interaction  (2) immense variety of distinct apps poses generalization and scalability issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce OS-Copilot, a novel framework to accelerate building computer agents on Linux/MacOS by providing a universal interface for interaction. It consolidates practices like Python code execution, Bash commands, API calls and mouse/keyboard control.
- Built FRIDAY, a self-improving embodied agent leveraging OS-Copilot. It features a configurator with working memory and self-directed learning to tackle unfamiliar apps.  

Key Contributions:
- OS-Copilot pioneers a conceptual framework for generalist computer agents, diverging from previous specialized endeavors. It serves as unified platform covering diverse OS interactions.
- FRIDAY demonstrates strong performance on GAIA benchmark and generalization to unseen apps, enabled by its self-evolving configurator. Case studies validate its ability to learn controlling Excel and building websites.
- OS-Copilot and empirical evidence from FRIDAY lay groundwork and provide insights to facilitate future research on capable and general-purpose computer agents.

In summary, this paper makes important headway in developing computer agents that can interact with and automate tasks across an entire operating system instead of just specialized applications. The proposed OS-Copilot framework and FRIDAY agent with its self-directed learning offer useful advancements toward more generalist computer agents.
