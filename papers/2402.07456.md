# [OS-Copilot: Towards Generalist Computer Agents with Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07456)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Most existing digital agents are designed for narrow domains and struggle to effectively interact with the heterogeneous operating system (OS) ecosystem comprising of diverse applications. 
- There is a lack of exploration around developing language agents that can interact with the entire OS instead of just individual applications. This presents two key challenges: (1) lack of a unified interface for agent-OS interaction  (2) immense variety of distinct apps poses generalization and scalability issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce OS-Copilot, a novel framework to accelerate building computer agents on Linux/MacOS by providing a universal interface for interaction. It consolidates practices like Python code execution, Bash commands, API calls and mouse/keyboard control.
- Built FRIDAY, a self-improving embodied agent leveraging OS-Copilot. It features a configurator with working memory and self-directed learning to tackle unfamiliar apps.  

Key Contributions:
- OS-Copilot pioneers a conceptual framework for generalist computer agents, diverging from previous specialized endeavors. It serves as unified platform covering diverse OS interactions.
- FRIDAY demonstrates strong performance on GAIA benchmark and generalization to unseen apps, enabled by its self-evolving configurator. Case studies validate its ability to learn controlling Excel and building websites.
- OS-Copilot and empirical evidence from FRIDAY lay groundwork and provide insights to facilitate future research on capable and general-purpose computer agents.

In summary, this paper makes important headway in developing computer agents that can interact with and automate tasks across an entire operating system instead of just specialized applications. The proposed OS-Copilot framework and FRIDAY agent with its self-directed learning offer useful advancements toward more generalist computer agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes OS-Copilot, a framework to build generalist agents capable of interfacing with comprehensive elements in an operating system, and demonstrates a self-improving embodied agent FRIDAY built on this framework that achieves strong performance on automating general computer tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The OS-Copilot framework, which is a conceptual framework for building generalist computer agents on Linux and MacOS. It provides a unified interface for app interactions in the heterogeneous OS ecosystem and can serve as a foundational platform for future research on personalized digital assistants, multi-modal agents, and agent learning.

2. The FRIDAY agent, which is a self-improving AI assistant built on top of the OS-Copilot framework. It is capable of solving general computer tasks and demonstrates strong performance on the GAIA benchmark as well as the ability to generalize across unseen applications through its innovative configurator module. The evaluation results for FRIDAY highlight the potential for it to serve as a helpful OS assistant.

In summary, the key innovations presented are the OS-Copilot framework for facilitating the development of OS-level agents and the FRIDAY agent itself, which sets new state-of-the-art results on a leading benchmark and shows promising generalization capabilities. Both the framework and agent aim to accelerate progress towards more capable and general-purpose computer agents.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the paper and method:

1. What are some limitations of the graph-based planner proposed in the framework? How could it be made more scalable and flexible for even more complex tasks? 

2. The self-directed learning module for accumulating tools and skills is an important innovation of the FRIDAY agent. What mechanisms could make this learning process more efficient or allow transfer to even more diverse applications?

3. How was the performance of FRIDAY assessed for safety, security, and reliability during real-world deployment? What additional testing is needed before wide-scale rollout?

4. The declarative, procedural and working memory modules connect the components of the framework. What alternative memory architectures could be explored? How do they impact overall agent capabilities?  

5. The tool generator creates customized tools for unfamiliar applications. How does it balance task-specificity and generalizability? Could a two-stage approach be used separating specialized vs general tools?

6. What mechanisms allow sharing of generated tools between different FRIDAY agents? Could a centralized repository be maintained and updated collaboratively by multiple agents?

7. How was the critic component tuned to provide accurate task completion judgments and appropriate scoring for tools? What additional objective functions could supplement its assessments? 

8. The actor executes actions via 4 methods - Python, Bash, APIs and Keyboard/Mouse. How are conflicts reconciled if multiple methods attempt simultaneous control?

9. How does the framework accommodate real-time user interaction and dynamic task specification? Are asynchronous interfaces or priority queues used for human-AI coordination?

10. The refiner implements self-correction - does it also facilitate more fundamental agent objective realignment over time if needed? How could this capability be made more transparent to users?
