# [Unifying Generation and Compression: Ultra-low bitrate Image Coding Via   Multi-stage Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Ultra-low bitrate image compression (below 0.05 bpp) is very challenging as traditional codecs produce blurry images while recent generative compression methods focus on generating high-frequency details but overlook modeling the prior distribution of image content. Accurately modeling this prior is key for both efficient entropy coding to achieve compression and generating lost information.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a unified image generation-compression (UIGC) framework that merges the processes of generation and compression by modeling the prior distribution to serve the dual purpose of entropy estimation for compression and sampling for generation. The key ideas are:

1) Adopt vector-quantized (VQ) image models to tokenize the images into discrete tokens suitable for prior modeling using transformers.

2) Propose a Multi-Stage Transformer (MST) that restructures the autoregressive order to better exploit spatial context and enhance prior modeling accuracy. 

3) Incorporate an edge-preserved checkerboard mask to selectively discard redundant tokens to achieve bitrate savings while maintaining essential structural details.

4) On the decoder, decompress preserved tokens and generate lost tokens by sampling from the MST's modeled prior distribution.

Main Contributions:

- A new UIGC paradigm that unifies generation and compression by modeled the prior distribution for both entropy estimation and content generation.

- A Multi-Stage Transformer tailored for images that enhances utilization of spatial context for improved prior modeling.

- An edge-preserved checkerboard mask that discards redundant tokens while preserving structure.

- Superior performance to state-of-the-art codecs at ultra-low bitrates ≤0.03 bpp, with enhanced perceptual quality and human perception.

The proposed innovations enable the framework to effectively exploit the prior for bitrate savings and content generation, setting a new direction for generative compression.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified image generation-compression framework that leverages vector-quantized image models and a multi-stage transformer to effectively exploit spatial context and model the prior distribution of tokens for enhanced entropy estimation and regeneration of lost tokens, achieving superior perceptual quality at ultra-low bitrates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Unified Image Generation-Compression (UIGC) framework for ultra-low bitrate image compression. The key ideas and contributions are:

1) It unifies the processes of image generation and compression by leveraging generative models to both estimate entropy for compression and generate lost content. This allows utilizing the learned prior distribution for both entropy coding efficiency and regenerating discarded tokens.

2) It introduces a Multi-Stage Transformer (MST) that restructures the autoregressive order to better exploit spatial context and enhance the accuracy of prior modeling for images.

3) It designs an edge-preserved checkerboard mask pattern to selectively discard redundant tokens to achieve bitrate savings while preserving essential structural information. 

4) Experiments show the proposed UIGC framework delivers superior rate-distortion performance and visual quality compared to state-of-the-art codecs, especially under ultra-low bitrate scenarios (≤0.03 bpp). It demonstrates the efficacy of unifying generation and compression within a single framework.

In summary, the key innovation is the novel UIGC paradigm that merges image generation and compression to effectively leverage learned priors for both entropy coding and content regeneration. The experiments validate its state-of-the-art performance for ultra-low bitrate image compression.

3. A Multi-Stage Transformer (MST) is proposed to model spatial context and the prior distribution of tokens. What is the rationale behind using a transformer model instead of existing autoregressive or non-autoregressive models? Explain the multi-stage design and ordering of tokens in the MST.  

4. An edge-preserved checkerboard mask is used for selectively discarding tokens. Why is an edge-preserving mechanism important? How does the checkerboard pattern connect to the multi-stage ordering of tokens and help maintain quality?

5. On the decoder side, lost tokens are predicted by sampling from the prior distribution modeled by MST. How does the ability to predict lost tokens aid extreme compression and image generation? Does this introduce any artifacts?

8. The paper discusses unifying entropy encoding and content generation via a common prior distribution. Elaborate on the connections between compression and generation through prior modeling. What future work can explore these ideas further?

9. The method focuses on modeling the distribution of discrete tokens rather than pixel values. What are the advantages of transforming images into a compact, discrete token space? What challenges emerge?

10. The UIGC framework is evaluated on the Kodak and CLIC datasets against several baselines. What were the key findings from the quantitative and qualitative results? Can you think of other datasets or experiments to conduct more analysis?
