# [Unifying Generation and Compression: Ultra-low bitrate Image Coding Via   Multi-stage Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Ultra-low bitrate image compression (below 0.05 bpp) is very challenging as traditional codecs produce blurry images while recent generative compression methods focus on generating high-frequency details but overlook modeling the prior distribution of image content. Accurately modeling this prior is key for both efficient entropy coding to achieve compression and generating lost information.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a unified image generation-compression (UIGC) framework that merges the processes of generation and compression by modeling the prior distribution to serve the dual purpose of entropy estimation for compression and sampling for generation. The key ideas are:

1) Adopt vector-quantized (VQ) image models to tokenize the images into discrete tokens suitable for prior modeling using transformers.

2) Propose a Multi-Stage Transformer (MST) that restructures the autoregressive order to better exploit spatial context and enhance prior modeling accuracy. 

3) Incorporate an edge-preserved checkerboard mask to selectively discard redundant tokens to achieve bitrate savings while maintaining essential structural details.

4) On the decoder, decompress preserved tokens and generate lost tokens by sampling from the MST's modeled prior distribution.

Main Contributions:

- A new UIGC paradigm that unifies generation and compression by modeled the prior distribution for both entropy estimation and content generation.

- A Multi-Stage Transformer tailored for images that enhances utilization of spatial context for improved prior modeling.

- An edge-preserved checkerboard mask that discards redundant tokens while preserving structure.

- Superior performance to state-of-the-art codecs at ultra-low bitrates â‰¤0.03 bpp, with enhanced perceptual quality and human perception.

The proposed innovations enable the framework to effectively exploit the prior for bitrate savings and content generation, setting a new direction for generative compression.
