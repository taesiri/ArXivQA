# [SCoTTi: Save Computation at Training Time with an adaptive framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12483)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
On-device training of machine learning models is emerging as an important approach for edge devices to enhance privacy and achieve real-time performance. However, the limited computational resources on edge devices make model training very challenging. Therefore, reducing resource usage during training is critical for enabling on-device learning.  

Proposed Solution - SCoTTi Framework:  
The paper proposes SCoTTi (Save Computation at Training Time), an adaptive framework to reduce computation and memory footprint during training by limiting neuron updates. SCoTTi builds on two key ideas:

1) Ultimate Optimizer: Dynamically learns the learning rate instead of using a pre-defined schedule. This accelerates convergence.

2) Neurons at Equilibrium (NEq): Uses a velocity threshold to identify neurons that have reached equilibrium and do not require further updates. Freezing these neuron updates reduces computation. 

Key Novelty: SCoTTi makes the velocity threshold (epsilon) an optimizable hyperparameter that is learned during training through gradient descent. This allows automatic tuning of epsilon for determining neurons updates, avoiding extensive hyperparameter search.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces epsilon as a learnable hyperparameter for adaptive neuron freezing.

- Integrates Ultimate Optimizer and NEq to simultaneously learn epsilon and learning rate.

- Achieves state-of-the-art computation savings during training across datasets (CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet etc.) and architectures (VGG, ResNets etc.)

- Slightly improves accuracy in some cases while providing significant FLOPs reduction of upto 86% for on-device learning scenarios.

The proposed SCoTTi framework provides an efficient and adaptive solution for reducing resource demands during on-device model training.
