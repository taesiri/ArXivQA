# [SCoTTi: Save Computation at Training Time with an adaptive framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12483)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
On-device training of machine learning models is emerging as an important approach for edge devices to enhance privacy and achieve real-time performance. However, the limited computational resources on edge devices make model training very challenging. Therefore, reducing resource usage during training is critical for enabling on-device learning.  

Proposed Solution - SCoTTi Framework:  
The paper proposes SCoTTi (Save Computation at Training Time), an adaptive framework to reduce computation and memory footprint during training by limiting neuron updates. SCoTTi builds on two key ideas:

1) Ultimate Optimizer: Dynamically learns the learning rate instead of using a pre-defined schedule. This accelerates convergence.

2) Neurons at Equilibrium (NEq): Uses a velocity threshold to identify neurons that have reached equilibrium and do not require further updates. Freezing these neuron updates reduces computation. 

Key Novelty: SCoTTi makes the velocity threshold (epsilon) an optimizable hyperparameter that is learned during training through gradient descent. This allows automatic tuning of epsilon for determining neurons updates, avoiding extensive hyperparameter search.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces epsilon as a learnable hyperparameter for adaptive neuron freezing.

- Integrates Ultimate Optimizer and NEq to simultaneously learn epsilon and learning rate.

- Achieves state-of-the-art computation savings during training across datasets (CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet etc.) and architectures (VGG, ResNets etc.)

- Slightly improves accuracy in some cases while providing significant FLOPs reduction of upto 86% for on-device learning scenarios.

The proposed SCoTTi framework provides an efficient and adaptive solution for reducing resource demands during on-device model training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SCoTTi, an adaptive training framework that saves computation at training time by learning a threshold to determine which neurons to update, achieving state-of-the-art computation savings across datasets and architectures while maintaining or slightly improving accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing SCoTTi, an adaptive framework that saves computation during neural network training by dynamically determining and updating a threshold ($\epsilon$) to identify which neurons need to be updated at each training iteration. Specifically:

- SCoTTi builds on top of two previous methods - the ultimate optimizer (which learns the learning rate during training) and the neurons at equilibrium concept (which freezes neuron updates when their output changes little between epochs). 

- The key innovation in SCoTTi is making the neuron equilibrium threshold ($\epsilon$) a learnable parameter that is dynamically optimized during training, instead of being a fixed hyperparameter. This allows automatic adaptation of $\epsilon$ to save computations while preserving accuracy.

- Experiments across various datasets and architectures like VGG, ResNets, Swin Transformers etc. show that SCoTTi reduces FLOPs by 30-86% during training compared to normal update schemes, while also slightly improving final accuracy in most cases.

In summary, the main contribution is an adaptive training procedure that saves computations by freezing non-informative neuron updates, where the threshold for determining neuron informativeness is itself automatically learned instead of manually tuned.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an adaptive framework called SCoTTi that aims to reduce computational requirements during training. Can you explain in detail how SCoTTi works and what are the key components it builds upon?

2. The concept of "neuron velocity" is utilized in SCoTTi to determine which neurons to update during training. Can you explain what neuron velocity refers to, how it is calculated, and why it is relevant for deciding when a neuron has reached equilibrium? 

3. The paper mentions optimizing a threshold parameter epsilon that controls which neurons get updated. How is epsilon incorporated into the training process? And how does SCoTTi enable epsilon to be learned dynamically during training?

4. How does SCoTTi leverage ideas from the Ultimate Optimizer and Neurons at Equilibrium methods? What specific techniques does it adapt from these approaches and how does it improve upon them? 

5. The Straight-Through Estimator (STE) technique is utilized when updating epsilon. What is the purpose of using STE here? And how does it allow for differentiability when neurons are frozen?

7. Analyze the results presented in Table 1. What trends can you observe regarding computation savings and accuracy across diverse datasets and architectures? Where does SCoTTi perform the best and why?

8. The paper mentions the issue of overfitting when neurons are updated for too long. How does the incremental adaptation of epsilon in SCoTTi help address this? Explain the mechanism.  

9. What adjustments would be required to apply SCoTTi to other domains like NLP or audio processing? What aspects are domain/architecture agnostic?

10. The paper states that SCoTTi enables flexibility for specific tasks while improving efficiency. Elaborate on how both these objectives are achieved and any trade-offs between them.
