# [Learning to better see the unseen: Broad-Deep Mixed Anti-Forgetting   Framework for Incremental Zero-Shot Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing zero-shot fault diagnosis (ZSFD) methods have two key limitations: 1) they cannot adapt to new emerging fault categories or attributes, referred to as the model mismatch problem; 2) they suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned fault diagnosis knowledge when updated with new fault data or attributes. 

To address these issues, the authors propose a new problem formulation called incremental zero-shot fault diagnosis (IZSFD). IZSFD involves two tasks: 1) category increment - new fault categories emerge over time; 2) attribute increment - new descriptive attributes for faults are introduced over time. The goal of IZSFD is to incrementally learn to diagnose new fault categories and attributes without forgetting previously learned diagnostic capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
A broad-deep mixed anti-forgetting framework (BDMAFF) is proposed to enable IZSFD. BDMAFF has two key components:

1) A deep generative model to generate features for historical and unseen faults. It employs three anti-forgetting strategies: a) replay of historical faults, b) attribute anti-forgetting loss, and c) feature prototype anti-forgetting loss. This retains memory of historical faults and transfers knowledge to unseen faults.

2) A diagnosis model with attribute prototype memory to retain knowledge of fault attributes. A memory-driven iterative update strategy is introduced to update the model when new categories/attributes emerge without needing historical data storage.  

Main Contributions:

1) First work to identify and formulate the incremental ZSFD problem to adapt ZSFD methods to practical industrial scenarios with emerging new fault categories and attributes.

2) Proposal of BDMAFF - a novel framework incorporating deep generative feature memory and diagnosis model prototypical attribute memory to enable incremental ZSFD.

3) Introduction of anti-forgetting losses and update strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in both the generative and diagnosis models.

4) Demonstrated effectiveness of BDMAFF on a real hydraulic system (category increment) and Tennessee Eastman process (attribute increment), outperforming existing methods.
