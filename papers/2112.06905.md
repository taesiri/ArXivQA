# [GLaM: Efficient Scaling of Language Models with Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06905)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper addresses is:Can sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art dense language models, while being more computationally efficient?Specifically, the authors propose and develop a family of generalist language models called GLaM that use a sparsely activated MoE architecture to scale model capacity while reducing training costs. The largest GLaM model has 1.2 trillion parameters but only activates 96.6 billion parameters per input token due to sparsity. The paper evaluates GLaM models extensively on zero, one, and few-shot natural language tasks and shows they outperform dense models like GPT-3 while using less computation.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that sparsely activated MoE can match or exceed the performance of dense models on few-shot NLP tasks, with greater efficiency. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed GLaM models.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses in this paper are:1) Can sparsely activated neural networks match or exceed the performance of dense neural networks at natural language processing tasks, while being more computationally efficient? The paper proposes a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer model called GLaM. The hypothesis is that this architecture can achieve competitive performance to dense models like GPT-3, while using less computation.2) How does data quantity versus data quality affect language model performance?The paper trains models on different filtered subsets of web data to study the impact of data quality on model performance. The hypothesis is that data quality is more important than sheer data quantity.3) Can sparsely activated models show reduced reliance on superficial statistical correlations? The paper evaluates GLaM on the WinoGender benchmark for coreference resolution. The hypothesis is that the sparse model will show reduced gap in performance between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples.Overall, the main hypothesis appears to be that sparsely activated models like GLaM can match or exceed dense model performance in various NLP tasks, while being more efficient computationally and potentially less prone to relying on statistical biases in the training data. The paper aims to demonstrate these advantages empirically.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:- This paper presents GLaM, a family of sparsely activated language models that use a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Other recent work has also explored large sparse models, like Switch Transformers, but GLaM focuses specifically on a decoder-only architecture for language modeling. So it explores sparsity in a different setting than other models.- The paper shows that GLaM models outperform dense models of comparable computational cost on several language understanding benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of sparsity for language tasks. Other work has shown advantages of sparsity for translation and other tasks, but this paper provides evidence these advantages apply to language as well.- A key contribution is showing that GLaM models can match or exceed the performance of dense models like GPT-3 while using a fraction of the compute resources for training and inference. Reducing compute costs has been a major focus recently, and this shows sparsely activated models can provide significant savings.- The analysis on the impact of training data quality is novel. While other work has focused on data scale, this paper shows filtering low-quality data improves performance even for models with over 1 trillion parameters. This highlights an understudied aspect of language model training.- The analysis of social biases and toxicity builds on recent work analyzing issues like gender bias and toxicity in large language models. The analysis here provides useful benchmarks on these issues for sparsely activated models specifically.Overall, this paper makes contributions in efficiently scaling language models, demonstrating advantages of sparsity, and analyzing data quality and ethical issues that complement other recent work on large language models and sparsely gated networks. The efficiency and performance analysis are the most novel aspects compared to related work.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes GLaM, a family of sparsely activated language models that use a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. The key idea is that GLaM activates only a small fraction of its total parameters for each input, allowing it to scale to over 1 trillion parameters while remaining efficient.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a family of language models called GLaM (Generalist Language Model), which uses a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to scale model capacity while reducing training cost. The key method is:GLaM interleaves Transformer layers with MoE layers, where each MoE layer contains many independent feedforward expert networks. A gating module dynamically routes each token to the most relevant few experts, so that only a small fraction of experts are activated per token. This allows scaling to over 1 trillion parameters while keeping the computational cost manageable. The largest GLaM model with 1.2T parameters activates only 96.6B parameters per token, enabling it to match or exceed the performance of previous dense models like GPT-3, while using only 1/3 of the training energy. Experiments on 29 NLP benchmarks show GLaM's advantages in zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot learning compared to dense baselines. Data filtering is also analyzed and shown to significantly boost model quality.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents GLaM, a family of generative language models that uses a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to scale model capacity while reducing training cost compared to dense models. The key method is the use of MoE layers, where each layer contains many independent expert networks. A gating module selects a small subset of experts for each input token, so that overall the model activates only a fraction of its parameters per input. This allows scaling model capacity exponentially while keeping the computational cost manageable.Specifically, the largest GLaM model has 1.2 trillion parameters but only activates 96.6 billion parameters per input token. It achieves better performance than dense models like GPT-3 on few-shot learning benchmarks, while using just 1/3 of the training energy and half the inference FLOPs compared to GPT-3. The sparse activation allows scaling model capacity at lower marginal cost than dense models.In summary, the main contribution is using sparsely-activated MoE to train giant yet efficient language models that outperform similarly sized dense models on few-shot learning tasks, enabling more cost-effective scaling.
