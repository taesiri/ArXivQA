# [Non-Consensual Synthetic Intimate Imagery: Prevalence, Attitudes, and   Knowledge in 10 Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01721)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deepfakes, specifically non-consensual synthetic intimate imagery (NSII) created using AI, enable new forms of image-based sexual abuse and have potential for significant harm. However, little is known about public awareness, attitudes, and engagement in behaviors involving NSII/deepfakes.

Methodology:
- The authors conducted an online survey with over 16,000 respondents across 10 countries to assess awareness, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors related to NSII/deepfakes.

Key Findings:
- Awareness of NSII/deepfakes was low overall (28% indicated familiarity). When informed about it, most felt related behaviors should be criminalized.  
- Self-reported victimization (2.2%) and perpetration (1.8%) prevalence was low. Most common behavior was viewing celebrity deepfake pornography.
- Compared to women, men deemed NSII behaviors less harmful, and were more likely to report both perpetration and victimization experiences.

Contributions:
- Provides initial benchmarking on international awareness, attitudes and engagement with NSII/deepfakes using a large, multi-country sample.
- Identifies gender differences in harm perceptions and experiences.
- Discusses implications for education, policies, laws, and technical interventions to prevent and mitigate harms associated with NSII/deepfakes.

In summary, this paper presents foundational survey data on the emerging issue of NSII/deepfakes across diverse countries. It highlights the need for further education and multifaceted interventions to address awareness and deter potentially harmful behaviors enabled by advancing synthetic media technologies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper surveyed over 16,000 people across 10 countries about their awareness of and attitudes towards deepfake pornography, finding low familiarity but general agreement it should be criminalized, with 2.2% reporting victimization and 1.8% indicating perpetration behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper presents findings from a large multi-country survey on awareness, attitudes, and behaviors related to non-consensual synthetic intimate imagery (NSII), also referred to as "deepfake pornography." Key findings include:

1) Despite media coverage, public familiarity with NSII/deepfakes is still low (less than 30% of respondents). Those informed tend to think related behaviors should be criminalized. 

2) Self-reported victimization rates were low (2.2% across countries). The most common behavior was passive consumption of celebrity deepfake porn, while actively creating or sharing was very rare.  

3) Compared to women, men viewed NSII behaviors as less problematic and were more likely to report both perpetration and victimization experiences.  

4) The study concludes more education is needed to deter potential perpetration/consumption. It also argues laws alone are likely insufficient and complementary technical interventions could help reduce harms.

In summary, the paper makes an important early contribution in documenting awareness, attitudes, behaviors, and gender dynamics related to the emerging issue of non-consensual synthetic intimate imagery across diverse countries.

The paper examines public awareness, attitudes, behaviors, victimization, and perpetration related to deepfakes/AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery across 10 different countries. It looks at gender differences and also discusses potential policy and technical interventions to address this issue. The key terms listed above reflect the major topics and concepts discussed in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper surveys over 16,000 respondents across 10 different countries. What considerations went into selecting these specific countries for the study? How might the country selection impact the generalizability of the results?

2. The study relies primarily on self-reported data about sensitive topics like sexual behaviors and abuse. How might this impact the reliability of the results, especially the prevalence rates reported? What steps did the authors take to encourage honest responding?

3. For the awareness questions, respondents were provided some information about deepfakes in the survey questions themselves. How might this "educating" of respondents impact their later attitude questions? Would an alternative approach, like asking about awareness first, have been preferable?

4. The authors use the term "non-consensual synthetic intimate imagery" (NSII) to refer broadly to fake intimate imagery, including both AI and non-AI generated content. What are the benefits of using this broad terminology versus more specific terminology like "deepfakes"? When might the broad terminology obscure important distinctions?

5. Perpetration behaviors in the survey include "creating" deepfake pornography. Why might the authors have included creation behaviors despite acknowleding that some may not view them as truly perpetration? What are the arguments on both sides here?  

6. For the qualitative analysis, inter-rater reliability scores were quite low across some codes. What might this suggest about the coding process? What steps could have improved reliability and enhanced the trustworthiness of the qualitative findings?

7. The study found higher victimization rates for deepfake pornography in Australia, Mexico, and South Korea. Both Australia and South Korea have relevant legislation criminalizing distribution of digitally altered imagery. How might the authors explain or interpret this result given the existing laws?

8. What motivations might drive people to create, share, or view deepfake pornography? How could these motivations have been assessed directly in the survey to provide more context around respondents' experiences with deepfakes?

9. The authors highlight several limitations related to sampling, language/cultural differences, and reliance on self-report. What additional limitations should be considered when interpreting and generalizing the results?  

10. The study concludes by offering several complementary technical, legal, and educational interventions to address deepfake harms. If you had to prioritize one area of intervention, which would it be and why? What key next steps would you recommend?
