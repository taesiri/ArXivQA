# [Graph Neural Prompting with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:"Can we learn beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs and integrate them into pre-trained large language models?" The key idea is to leverage factual knowledge in knowledge graphs to enhance the capabilities of large pre-trained language models, while avoiding the need to train a specialized model architecture from scratch. The paper proposes a method called "Graph Neural Prompting" to address this question.In summary, the main hypothesis is that encoding pertinent factual knowledge and structural information from knowledge graphs into "graph neural prompts" can provide useful guidance to large pre-trained language models and improve their performance on downstream tasks like question answering. The method aims to identify and extract the most beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs and integrate it effectively into frozen pre-trained LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel method called Graph Neural Prompting (GNP) to help pre-trained large language models (LLMs) learn beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs. GNP contains several components including a GNN encoder, cross-modality pooling, a domain projector, and self-supervised link prediction loss.2. Conducting extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets for commonsense and biomedical reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that GNP can significantly improve the performance of LLMs by +13.5% when the LLM parameters are frozen and +1.8% when the LLM is tuned with parameter-efficient methods like LoRA.3. Showing that GNP can achieve competitive or better performance compared to full fine-tuning of the LLM on 10 out of 12 evaluations, without needing to tune the entire large model.4. Performing ablation studies, model design comparisons, parameter sensitivity analysis, case studies, and visualizations to provide insights into how the different components of GNP contribute to the improvements.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel prompt-based method to help pre-trained LLMs extract and leverage beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs, demonstrated through comprehensive experiments and analysis. The method allows improving LLMs without full fine-tuning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on using knowledge graphs to enhance language models:- This paper proposes a new method called Graph Neural Prompting (GNP) to learn representations from knowledge graphs to enhance pre-trained language models (LLMs). Most prior work has focused on joint training of knowledge graphs and text from scratch, which is problematic for large LLMs. GNP is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to existing pre-trained LLMs.- GNP uses a graph neural network to encode the knowledge graph, followed by cross-modality pooling and a domain projector to select relevant information and map it to the text domain. This is a novel way of learning prompts from knowledge graphs tailored to the input text. Prior work like KAPING simply retrieved related triples from the KG as prompts.- The paper evaluates GNP extensively across multiple datasets and LLM sizes, demonstrating strong improvements over baselines when using GNP prompts with frozen or tuned LLMs. For instance, GNP improves performance by 13.5% on average when the LLM is frozen.- The design of GNP seems more sophisticated than prior work, incorporating multiple components like self-supervised graph learning. The ablation studies validate the importance of each component.- Overall, GNP seems to offer an effective way to extract and incorporate useful knowledge from KGs to guide LLMs. The comprehensive experiments and analyses are a key strength. The method appears to advance the state-of-the-art in knowledge graph enhanced language modeling.In summary, the paper proposes a novel prompting method to incorporate external knowledge into LLMs, with rigorous experiments demonstrating its strengths. The approach appears to meaningfully advance work on integrating structured knowledge graphs with large pre-trained language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring different graph neural network architectures and objectives for learning from knowledge graphs. The authors mention that their proposed approach uses a standard GNN encoder and link prediction loss, but other GNN variants could potentially work better.- Studying how to determine the optimal subgraph to retrieve from the knowledge graph for each question. The paper currently uses a simple neighbors + relations subgraph, but more advanced retrieval and pruning techniques could help reduce noise.- Evaluating the framework on even larger language models and additional datasets. The authors experiment with up to 11B parameter models, but it would be interesting to see if the benefits generalize to models with hundreds of billions or trillions of parameters.- Applying the method to other modalities beyond text, such as image-text tasks, by learning cross-modal representations. The cross-modality pooling module could potentially be extended.- Exploring different ways to integrate the learned graph prompt with the language model, rather than just concatenating it to the input embedding. For instance, using it as an auxiliary conditioning input.- Studying prompt learning at both the instance level and dataset level to better adapt to new tasks and domains. The current prompt is instance-specific but dataset prompts may help too.- Analyzing the learned prompts to understand what knowledge is being captured from the graphs and how it aids reasoning. This could shed light on the model's reasoning process.In summary, the authors propose further exploring GNN variants, subgraph retrieval, larger models, new tasks/data, cross-modal learning, prompt integration, and prompt analysis as interesting future work based on their method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Graph Neural Prompting (GNP) to assist pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in extracting and leveraging beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs. GNP uses a graph neural network to encode factual knowledge and structural information from a retrieved knowledge graph subgraph into a prompt embedding vector. This graph neural prompt is then concatenated with the input text embedding and fed into the LLM to provide useful guidance. GNP contains several components including a GNN encoder, cross-modality pooling to identify pertinent nodes, a domain projector to bridge graph and text domains, and a self-supervised link prediction loss. Experiments on commonsense and biomedical reasoning datasets show GNP significantly improves results especially when the LLM parameters are frozen, outperforming prompt tuning baselines. GNP also boosts LLM fine-tuning approaches like LoRA. The method provides a plug-and-play way to inject knowledge graph information to guide pre-trained LLMs without expensive joint training.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Graph Neural Prompting (GNP), a novel method to assist pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in learning beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). GNP uses a graph neural network to encode the structural information and factual knowledge from KG subgraphs relevant to the input text. It includes a cross-modality pooling module to identify the most pertinent nodes, a domain projector to bridge the graph and text domains, and a self-supervised link prediction loss. GNP outputs a soft prompt embedding called the Graph Neural Prompt that provides guidance to the LLM.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a method called Graph Neural Prompting (GNP) to learn beneficial knowledge from knowledge graphs to enhance large language models (LLMs) for question answering. GNP has several components:1) A graph neural network encoder to embed the retrieved knowledge graph subgraphs. 2) A cross-modality pooling module to identify the most relevant nodes to the question and consolidate them into a graph-level embedding. 3) A domain projector to map the graph embeddings to the text domain for compatibility with the LLM. 4) A self-supervised link prediction objective to refine the model's understanding of graph structure.During inference, GNP encodes the pertinent factual knowledge and graph structure into a Graph Neural Prompt embedding vector. This prompt is then fed into the LLM along with the question text to provide guidance. Experiments show GNP significantly improves results on commonsense and biomedical QA when the LLM parameters are frozen or tuned with limited fine-tuning. The method provides an effective way to leverage knowledge graphs to enhance pre-trained LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of improving large language models using knowledge graphs. Some key points:- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive performance on many language tasks, but still have limitations in precisely capturing and returning factual knowledge from the real world. - Knowledge graphs store factual knowledge in a structured way and could help provide useful background knowledge to LLMs. However, joint training of KGs and LLMs is challenging due to the large size and computational costs of LLMs.- Existing methods directly feed KG triples into LLMs, but this can introduce noise as KGs contain extraneous information. - The main research question is: Can we learn to extract only the beneficial knowledge from KGs and integrate it into pre-trained LLMs in a way that improves their reasoning and factuality?- The proposed method Graph Neural Prompting (GNP) aims to address this by using a graph neural network to encode relevant KG knowledge into "graph prompts" that provide useful guidance to the LLM.So in summary, the key problem is improving LLMs' factual reasoning by extracting and integrating only the most useful knowledge from knowledge graphs, in a way that works with pre-trained LLMs without expensive joint training. The GNP method is proposed to learn graph prompts that provide targeted factual knowledge to guide the LLM.
