# [Unveiling Parts Beyond Objects:Towards Finer-Granularity Referring   Expression Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08007)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task that goes beyond classic object-level referring segmentation to enable finer-grained part-level grounding. To facilitate research into this new direction, the authors construct a new benchmark dataset called RefCOCOm by manually annotating part-level targets in RefCOCO images. They also build a large-scale visual grounding dataset called MRES-32M comprising over 32 million high-quality masks and captions to advance multi-granularity understanding. A simple yet effective baseline model named UniRES is presented to accomplish unified object-level and part-level segmentation. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg datasets for classic RES, as well as the new RefCOCOm benchmark for the proposed MRES task. By releasing the RefCOCOm benchmark, MRES-32M dataset and UniRES model, this work aims to promote future research into finer-grained visual grounding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation task and benchmark, constructs a large-scale multi-granularity visual grounding dataset, and develops a unified segmentation model achieving state-of-the-art performance on both classic object-level and the new part-level referring segmentation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It proposes a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task and a corresponding benchmark dataset RefCOCOm for evaluating performance on finer-grained part-level referring segmentation. This pushes classic object-level referring segmentation to a more challenging and detailed understanding.

2. It builds a large-scale multi-grained visual grounding dataset called MRES-32M, which contains over 32 million high-quality masks and captions. This is the first dataset that provides annotations for both object-level and part-level vision-language grounding.

3. It designs a simple yet effective baseline model named UniRES that can accomplish both object-level and part-level referring segmentation in a unified framework. Experiments show UniRES achieves new state-of-the-art performance on classic object-level RES datasets as well as the proposed multi-granularity RefCOCOm benchmark.

In summary, this work makes significant contributions towards finer-grained visual grounding by proposing the MRES task, constructing corresponding benchmarks and datasets, and developing a strong baseline model, with the goal of inspiring more research in this direction.
