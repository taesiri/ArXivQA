# [Sentinels of the Stream: Unleashing Large Language Models for Dynamic   Packet Classification in Software Defined Networks -- Position Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07950)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to explore the applicability of large language models (LLMs) for dynamic packet classification and intrusion detection in software defined networks. Specifically, the authors want to create a LLM named "Sentinel" that can analyze network packet contents and identify malicious attack packets.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors plan to fine-tune three existing LLMs - Llama2-7B, Falcon-7B and Mixtral MoE - on a custom dataset of network packets captured during denial-of-service attacks in a simulated software defined network. This finetuning will specialize the models to understand the "language" of network packets and identify threats.

The key steps are:
1) Generate dataset using network simulator Containernet with various attack scenarios
2) Preprocess packets into bit-stream format understood by LLMs 
3) Finetune LLMs on this dataset to create Sentinel

Main Contributions:
- Proposal to apply recent advances in large language models to network intrusion detection
- Plan to create customized dataset of network packets under attack scenarios
- Approach to finetune multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to identify threats in packet streams
- Introduction of Sentinel, a specialized LLM for dynamic packet classification and attack detection

The paper lays out the plan and rationale for using large language models for enhanced network security in software defined networking environments. The feasibility of this approach needs to be demonstrated by actually finetuning models on the custom dataset and evaluating performance.
