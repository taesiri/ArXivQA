# [Fine-Tuning, Prompting, In-Context Learning and Instruction-Tuning: How   Many Labelled Samples Do We Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- When limited labelled data is available, researchers can either use a large, general pre-trained language model without updating its parameters, or use the few examples to tune a smaller, more specialized model. But it's unclear how many labelled examples are needed for the specialized models to outperform the general ones.

- Prior work compared approaches inconsistently using different model sizes, data sizes, or non-representative settings. Few works study model performance across full dataset sizes to identify when specialized models surpass general models.

Methodology:
- The authors investigate fine-tuning, prompting, in-context learning and instruction tuning on 3 NLP datasets as the number of training labels is increased exponentially from 10 to the full dataset. 

- Multiple runs are performed to account for variance. Break-even points are identified between specialized and general models on average performance and by considering standard deviation.

Key Findings:
- Specialized models need only hundreds to thousands of labels to match or surpass the general models, but this varies based on task complexity. More complex tasks require more labelled data.

- Instruction tuning of small models with as few as 10 labels can match performance of large models prompting/in-context learning on thousands of labels.

- Considering variance from multiple runs increases required labels by 25-200% at break-even points. In-context learning shows high variance.  

Conclusions:
- It is often better to label some data and specialize smaller models than to use large general models without updating for a target task. But large models are still useful for quick prototyping before data labelling.

- The number of labels needed to specialize smaller models varies based on task complexity but is often only hundreds to thousands. Instruction tuning is very efficient.

- Results demonstrate specialized models are still strong contenders against large models given some labelled data. But relative benefits depend on task properties.
