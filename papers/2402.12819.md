# [Fine-Tuning, Prompting, In-Context Learning and Instruction-Tuning: How   Many Labelled Samples Do We Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- When limited labelled data is available, researchers can either use a large, general pre-trained language model without updating its parameters, or use the few examples to tune a smaller, more specialized model. But it's unclear how many labelled examples are needed for the specialized models to outperform the general ones.

- Prior work compared approaches inconsistently using different model sizes, data sizes, or non-representative settings. Few works study model performance across full dataset sizes to identify when specialized models surpass general models.

Methodology:
- The authors investigate fine-tuning, prompting, in-context learning and instruction tuning on 3 NLP datasets as the number of training labels is increased exponentially from 10 to the full dataset. 

- Multiple runs are performed to account for variance. Break-even points are identified between specialized and general models on average performance and by considering standard deviation.

Key Findings:
- Specialized models need only hundreds to thousands of labels to match or surpass the general models, but this varies based on task complexity. More complex tasks require more labelled data.

- Instruction tuning of small models with as few as 10 labels can match performance of large models prompting/in-context learning on thousands of labels.

- Considering variance from multiple runs increases required labels by 25-200% at break-even points. In-context learning shows high variance.  

Conclusions:
- It is often better to label some data and specialize smaller models than to use large general models without updating for a target task. But large models are still useful for quick prototyping before data labelling.

- The number of labels needed to specialize smaller models varies based on task complexity but is often only hundreds to thousands. Instruction tuning is very efficient.

- Results demonstrate specialized models are still strong contenders against large models given some labelled data. But relative benefits depend on task properties.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The paper finds that fine-tuned specialized smaller models achieve competitive performance to larger pre-trained language models in zero/few-shot settings using only a few hundred to few thousand labelled examples, though task complexity and variance impact the exact amount required.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors perform a comprehensive investigation of the impact of changing the number of labelled training samples on the performance and variance of fine-tuning, prompting, in-context learning and instruction-tuning approaches across 3 datasets of varying complexity. 

2) By identifying break-even points between different models and approaches, they find that smaller, more specialised models require only a small number of labelled training examples (dependent on task complexity, from 100s to 1000s) to achieve performance on par or better than more general models used in zero/few-shot settings.

3) They find significant impact of results variance, increasing the amount of required labelled samples by 25%-200%.

In essence, the paper shows that while large language models can be effective in low-data regimes, smaller specialised models tuned with even modest amounts of labelled data can match or surpass their performance. The number of required labelled examples depends strongly on the task complexity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and topics associated with this paper include:

- Fine-tuning - The process of taking a pre-trained language model and specializing it to a downstream task by continuing the training process on a dataset for that task. This is one of the key techniques explored.

- Prompting - Using a language model in a zero-shot setting by providing a prompt containing instructions and examples for a task and mapping the model's generated text to outputs. Also a key technique explored. 

- In-context learning - A variant of prompting where the prompt contains demo examples to better guide the model, a type of few-shot learning setting.

- Instruction tuning - Fine-tuning a model specifically for better instruction following, such as by using a cloze-style objective to predict masked words.

- Break-even points - The analysis looks at how much labelled data is needed for fine-tuned models to match/exceed the performance of prompting/in-context learning. Identifying these break-even points is a key contribution.

- Model sizes - The paper compares smaller vs larger language models across the techniques.

- Variance - Taking into account variance of results across runs is another focus.

- Task complexity - Experiments are conducted on datasets/tasks of varying complexity, enabling analysis of how complexity impacts the break-even points.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares multiple approaches for low-resource learning, including fine-tuning, prompting, in-context learning, and instruction tuning. Can you explain the key differences between these approaches and how they utilize the available labelled data? 

2. The paper identifies "break-even points" where specialized models tuned on limited data start to outperform more general models without tuning. What factors do you think influence these break-even points and how could they be further analyzed?

3. The results show significant differences in sample efficiency across tasks. What properties of the tasks (SST-2, MRPC, BoolQ) might explain why some require more data than others for specialized models to be effective?

4. Instruction tuning with just 10 samples rivals the performance of other approaches. Why might this simple tuning procedure be so effective compared to the other methods? What are its limitations?

5. The paper argues specialized models are still competitive given enough data. Do you agree? When would it be preferable to use general models without tuning instead?

6. Prompt engineering is highlighted as an alternative way to improve performance without labeled data. How feasible do you think manual or automatic prompt engineering would be for real-world applications?

7. There are some discrepancies between the prompting performance of models like LLaMA vs their in-context learning performance. What might explain these differences and how could prompting be enhanced?  

8. The choice of model size clearly impacts the variance of results. How should uncertainty and variance guide the selection and use of different models in practice?

9. The carbon emissions for running the larger models are significant. How could the experiments be adjusted to further reduce emissions without compromising the findings?

10. The paper focuses on English text classification. How do you think the findings might differ for language generation tasks or for other languages besides English? What additional experiments could be run?
