# [Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation of Deep Visual Models using   Domain-Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation without Source Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10062)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we estimate the accuracy of a deep visual model on unlabeled target data from a different domain, without needing access to any labeled source data used to train the original model?The key hypothesis seems to be:By leveraging recent advances in source-free domain adaptation to obtain a pseudo-labeling model adapted to the target data distribution, and using disagreement rates between this adapted model and the original model on target samples, we can accurately estimate the target accuracy of the original model without needing the source training data.In summary, the paper is investigating whether accurate unsupervised accuracy estimation is possible in a source-free setting, which removes the assumption made in prior work that labeled source data is available. The proposed method aims to address this question by using pseudo-labeling via domain adaptation on the target data alone.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework for unsupervised accuracy estimation (UAE) of deep visual models on target data without requiring access to source data. The key ideas are:- Employing source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods to obtain a pseudo-labeling function on the target data that approximates the true labeling function. This allows estimating accuracy via the disagreement rate between the source model and adapted target model on the target data.- Enhancing the quality of estimation by using target-adaptive virtual adversarial perturbations (VAPs) that account for predictive uncertainty and domain discrepancy. This helps mitigate the impact of inaccurate pseudo-labels. - Introducing the overall proposed framework called SF-DAP that integrates source-free UDA and target-adaptive VAPs for effective source-free UAE.- Developing a simple yet effective source-free UDA method called PAFA that aligns target features with the source classifier. PAFA achieves strong performance on UDA benchmarks.- Extensive experiments showing SF-DAP outperforms existing UAE methods reliant on source data access across various domain shift scenarios, even without using any source samples.In summary, the main contribution is a novel source-free UAE framework that leverages source-free UDA and adaptive adversarial perturbations to accurately estimate model accuracy on unlabeled target data without needing source access. This is the first work to address the more practical source-free setting for UAE.

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new framework to estimate the accuracy of visual recognition models on unlabeled target data without requiring access to the original labeled source data used to train the models, by employing recent advances in source-free domain adaptation and perturbation techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:- This paper focuses on unsupervised accuracy estimation (UAE) without requiring access to source data. Most prior work in UAE has assumed access to labeled source data. Not needing source data makes the method more practical in many real-world scenarios.- The proposed approach adapts ideas from recent advances in source-free domain adaptation to generate pseudo-labels for target data. It is the first work to bring together source-free UDA and source-free UAE.- The method introduces a new technique called adaptive adversarial perturbations (AAP) to account for uncertainty and distribution shifts when estimating target accuracy. This is a novel way to handle challenging distribution shifts. - Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing UAE techniques on several domain shift benchmarks, even without using any source data. This shows the promise of source-free methods.- For the source-free UDA component, the paper proposes a simplified self-training approach called PAFA. It achieves comparable results to prior source-free UDA methods like SHOT and FAUST.- Overall, the key novelty is showing source-free UAE is viable by carefully adapting recent ideas in UDA. The performance is competitive or better than source-based methods while removing assumptions about accessibility of source data.In summary, this work makes an important contribution in making UAE more practical by eliminating source data dependence. The techniques leverage recent UDA advances in a novel way to tackle this challenging problem. The results are very promising for source-free UAE.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Investigating other source-free domain adaptation methods in the proposed SF-DAP framework. The authors note that PAFA showed good performance, but exploring other recent source-free DA methods could potentially lead to further improvements.- Exploring different ways to enhance the quality of the accuracy estimation, beyond adversarial perturbations. The authors propose adaptive adversarial perturbations in this work, but suggest there may be other techniques worth investigating.- Applying the proposed framework to other applications and data types beyond image classification. The authors demonstrate it on standard vision benchmarks, but it could likely be useful for other data modalities and tasks.- Developing more advanced uncertainty quantification techniques to help guide the perturbation process. The authors use a simple Monte Carlo dropout approach here, but more sophisticated uncertainty measures could further improve the estimation.- Extending the framework to settings with partial source data access or limited source training. The current method assumes no source access, but variants that can utilize limited source data when available could be useful.- Exploring joint tuning of the feature extractor and classifier, rather than just tuning the feature extractor as in this work. Co-adapting both components may lead to better target models and estimation.- Validating the approach on a wider range of real-world domain shift scenarios beyond the benchmark datasets used here.So in summary, the authors propose several promising avenues such as novel source-free DA methods, different estimation enhancement techniques, extending to new applications/data types, improving uncertainty estimation, incorporating limited source data, joint tuning, and more extensive real-world testing.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new framework to estimate the accuracy of deep visual models on unlabeled target data without requiring access to the original source data used to train the models. The key idea is to use recent advances in source-free domain adaptation to adapt the pre-trained source model to the target data distribution and obtain a pseudo-labeling function for the target data. The disagreement rate between this adapted target model and the original source model on the target data then serves as an estimate of the source model's target accuracy. To improve the quality of this estimate, the authors introduce adaptive adversarial perturbations to the target model's inputs during inference to account for predictive uncertainty and distribution shifts. Experiments across various domain adaptation benchmarks demonstrate that this proposed source-free approach can effectively estimate target accuracy and outperforms existing methods reliant on source data access. A simple yet effective source-free domain adaptation method called PAFA is also introduced. Overall, this work provides a practical solution for evaluating model accuracy when source data is inaccessible, a common real-world constraint.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new framework to estimate the accuracy of deep visual models on unlabeled target data without requiring access to the original source training data. The key idea is to use recent advances in source-free domain adaptation to adapt the pre-trained source model to the target data distribution. This adapted model serves as a pseudo-labeling function for the target data. The disagreement rate between the source model predictions and the target pseudo-labels then provides an estimate of the target accuracy. To improve the quality of this accuracy estimation, the authors incorporate virtual adversarial perturbations during inference on the adapted model. These perturbations help account for predictive uncertainty and distribution shifts between source and target. The magnitude of the perturbations is determined in an adaptive way based on factors like predictive uncertainty, domain divergence, data density, and number of classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this proposed framework outperforms existing approaches reliant on source data access across various dataset benchmarks and distribution shift scenarios. Notably, it is the first technique to enable accuracy estimation in a completely source-free manner.
