# [Prune Spatio-temporal Tokens by Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04549)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The goal is to develop an efficient token pruning strategy for video transformers to optimize the speed-accuracy trade-off without requiring model retraining. - The key idea is to prune tokens with high temporal redundancy while retaining semantically meaningful tokens. This is done by proposing a Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation (STA) score.- The STA score considers two factors: temporal redundancy and semantic importance. It captures temporal redundancy by evaluating if a token is a new occurrence or a seen entity. It captures semantic importance using an activation-based attention map.- Tokens with higher STA scores have higher temporal redundancy and lower semantics, so they are pruned. This pruning is done progressively in multiple stages.- The approach is applied to off-the-shelf ViT and VideoSwin transformers. Results on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2 show significant computation reduction (30-50%) with minimal accuracy drop (0.1-0.2%).In summary, the key hypothesis is that pruning tokens in videos based on temporal redundancy and semantic importance can optimize video transformers efficiently without retraining. The STA score is proposed to enable such optimization in a plug-and-play manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new token pruning strategy called Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation (STA) to accelerate video Transformers. The key ideas are:- Considering two factors for pruning tokens: temporal redundancy and semantic importance. Tokens that are repetitive across frames or have low semantic relevance are pruned.- Modeling temporal redundancy via a Markov chain that accumulates token similarity scores across frames. This captures redundancy along the temporal dimension. - Using an activation-based attention map to measure semantic importance of each token. Important tokens are retained even if temporally redundant.- Applying STA hierarchically at multiple Transformer blocks without extra parameters or retraining. This progressively prunes redundant and insignificant tokens.- Evaluating STA on various ViT and VideoSwin backbones for video recognition. It reduces FLOPs by 30-50% with minimal accuracy drop, outperforming prior arts.In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective yet simple strategy to accelerate video Transformers by pruning redundant and semantically unimportant tokens in a hierarchical manner. The temporal aggregation and semantic awareness makes it well-suited for video.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation (STA) method to prune redundant spatio-temporal tokens from video Transformers, which considers both temporal redundancy and semantic importance to accelerate inference speed with minimal impact on accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related research on video transformers and token pruning:- This paper proposes a new scoring method called Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation (STA) to prune tokens for video transformers. Other works like DynamicViT, EViT, and STTS have explored token pruning for image transformers, but there has been less work focused specifically on video. STA considers both temporal redundancy and semantic importance when scoring tokens.- Compared to STTS which does separate spatial and temporal token pruning, this paper prunes tokens jointly across the spatio-temporal dimensions. The results show that STA outperforms STTS, indicating that joint spatio-temporal pruning can be more effective.- This paper shows STA can be applied to different off-the-shelf transformer architectures like ViT and VideoSwin without retraining or adding new parameters. Other methods like DynamicViT require training a lightweight gating module. Not needing retraining makes STA easy to deploy.- The paper demonstrates very strong results on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2, achieving state-of-the-art tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency. For example, STA reduces computation by 3-4x compared to MViTv2 while maintaining the same accuracy on Kinetics-400.- The ablation studies provide useful insights, like showing that a decreasing schedule for dropping tokens works best, and that modeling semantics is more important for larger transformers. This sheds light on how token pruning interacts with transformer scale.In summary, this paper makes contributions in designing an effective scoring method for video token pruning that considers temporal context, showing it can accelerate different transformer architectures without retraining, and achieving leading accuracy/efficiency tradeoffs on video recognition benchmarks. The approach is well-motivated and the experiments are thorough.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing pruning algorithms specifically tailored for window-based Transformers like VideoSwin. The paper mentions that VideoSwin is not naturally suited for unstructured token pruning since it relies on structural integrity for its window shuffling operation. The authors propose a simple workaround but suggest exploring pruning methods compatible with window attention.- Training video Transformers end-to-end with the proposed STA pruning method. The authors only demonstrate inference acceleration on pretrained models but suggest STA could be used during training to reduce computational overhead. - Applying STA to deeper backbone architectures. The paper shows results on Vision Transformers up to 24 layers, but the authors suggest the approach may become more effective for ultra-deep Transformers.- Exploring the integration of STA with other efficiency techniques like knowledge distillation. The authors propose STA as a standalone method, but it could potentially be combined with other methods.- Adapting STA to other spatio-temporal tasks beyond video action recognition, such as video object detection or segmentation. The core ideas of STA could generalize.- Developing adaptive or learned scheduling for determining how many tokens to prune per stage, rather than using fixed heuristics. A learned strategy could optimize the schedule.- Validating STA on a broader range of video Transformer architectures and datasets. The paper focuses on ViT and VideoSwin on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2.In summary, the main directions are improving compatibility with more model designs, integration with other efficiency methods, and application to more tasks and datasets. The overall idea of pruning tokens via temporal redundancy and semantics seems promising to explore further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new token pruning strategy called Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation (STA) to optimize the speed-accuracy tradeoff of video transformers without retraining. The key idea is to prune tokens that have high temporal redundancy (similar tokens appearing in previous frames) while retaining semantically important tokens. Specifically, STA evaluates each token's temporal redundancy by measuring similarity to previous tokens and aggregates this over time. It also measures each token's semantic importance based on its contribution to the overall video classification. Tokens with high temporal redundancy and low semantics are pruned. STA is applied progressively at multiple transformer blocks on ViT and VideoSwin backbones. Experiments on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2 show significant computation reduction (25-49% for ViT, 23-47% for VideoSwin) with minimal accuracy drop (~0.2%). The results demonstrate STA's effectiveness at accelerating off-the-shelf video transformers by eliminating spatio-temporal redundancy while preserving semantic information.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new token pruning strategy called Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation (STA) to reduce the computational cost of video transformers with minimal impact on accuracy. The key idea is to prune tokens that are temporally redundant while retaining semantically important ones. The STA score considers two factors - temporal redundancy and semantic importance. Temporal redundancy is measured by aggregating token similarities across frames to identify repetitive tokens. Semantic importance is captured using an activation map to weigh each token's contribution to the prediction. Tokens with high STA scores are pruned progressively in multiple stages. Experiments on ViT and VideoSwin backbones for Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2 show the method reduces FLOPs by 30-50% with only 0.2% accuracy drop. The algorithm requires no extra parameters or retraining. Overall, STA provides an effective way to accelerate video transformers by pruning inconsequential spatio-temporal tokens based on their temporal redundancy and semantic value.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a method called Prune Spatio-temporal Tokens by Semantic-aware Temporal Accumulation (STA) to efficiently prune tokens from video transformers like ViT and VideoSwin, in order to reduce computational complexity with minimal impact on accuracy. The key idea is to score each token based on two factors: temporal redundancy and semantic importance. Temporal redundancy is measured by comparing a token to similar tokens in previous frames, aggregating across frames to assign a redundancy score. Semantic importance is measured by the activation magnitude, indicating relevance to the class label. These two scores are combined into a final STA score, and tokens with the highest STA scores (high redundancy, low semantics) are pruned. The pruning is done progressively in multiple stages across the transformer, removing more tokens in earlier layers. The method doesn't require retraining the transformer or introducing any new parameters. Experiments on Kinetics and Something-Something datasets show this achieves 30-50% FLOPs reduction with only 0.2% drop in accuracy for ViT and VideoSwin.
