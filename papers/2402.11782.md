# [What Evidence Do Language Models Find Convincing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retrieval-augmented language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for open-domain question answering, where they must resolve ambiguous or controversial queries by searching through conflicting web evidence. 
- It's unclear what types of evidence these models actually find convincing when answers are ambiguous. Past work has studied human perceptions, but little on AI systems.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a dataset called ConflictingQA that contains controversial questions paired with real-world web paragraphs arguing different stances. 
- They use this to analyze what textual features correlate with an LLM judging a paragraph as convincing when paired against conflicting evidence.

Key Contributions:
- ConflictingQA benchmarks LLMs on resolving realistic conflicting evidence for open-ended queries.
- Analysis shows models strongly rely on relevance to the question over stylistic factors that influence humans (references, objectivity).  
- Simple relevance-based perturbations (adding a relevance statement) substantially boost paragraph convincingness.
- Results suggest the need to improve evidence quality in retrieval-augmented systems and better align training with human credibility judgements.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that current LLMs overly focus on relevance rather than argument quality when judging what evidence is convincing for ambiguous questions. The authors construct a valuable benchmark and analysis to highlight this issue.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces ConflictingQA, a dataset of controversial questions paired with real-world evidence documents containing different facts and arguments, which is used to analyze what evidence language models find convincing when resolving ambiguity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper introduces a new dataset called ConflictingQA for studying what types of evidence language models find convincing when answering controversial or ambiguous questions. The dataset consists of open-ended questions paired with conflicting real-world evidence paragraphs retrieved from the web. The authors use this dataset to analyze which textual features correlate with a paragraph's "convincingness", measured by how often a model's prediction aligns with the stance of that paragraph. Through sensitivity and counterfactual analyses, they find that models tend to over-rely on relevance to the question and largely ignore stylistic factors like informational content, references, confidence, etc. that humans find important for credibility judgments. The work highlights gaps between human and model assessments of evidence as well as the need for higher quality evidence and potentially different training objectives. Overall, it provides insights into how models resolve ambiguity in open-ended QA.

The key contributions are: (1) the new ConflictingQA dataset for analyzing model convincingness, (2) analyses revealing models' over-reliance on relevance vs. human-like credibility factors, and (3) insights into improving evidence quality and training for more human-aligned open-ended QA.

- Real-world evidence documents
- Controversial queries
- Sensitivity analysis
- Counterfactual analysis
- Relevance
- Stylistic features

- Corpus quality
- Human judgments

The paper examines how language models handle conflicting or ambiguous evidence when answering controversial queries. It constructs a dataset called ConflictingQA that contains real-world evidence paragraphs with different facts, argument styles, and answers. The authors then perform analysis to understand what text features make certain evidence more or less convincing to language models, finding that models tend to over rely on relevance compared to the stylistic factors that humans find important. Overall, the key focus is on studying the perceptions of credibility and convincingness in language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed convincingness metric, win-rate, account for factors like the ordering of evidence paragraphs presented to the language model? Does ordering bias pose a threat to the validity of this metric?

2. The counterfactual analysis involves using an AI system (Claude) to edit the evidence paragraphs. Could this introduce unintended biases or artifacts into the analysis? How was the objectivity of Claude ensured?  

3. Several of the stylistic changes made in the counterfactual analysis, like adding references or contact info, only make small modifications to the text. Could more drastic stylistic changes like paraphrasing lead to different results?

4. How sensitive are the results to the choice of language models analyzed? Would analyzing a wider range of architectures give a more comprehensive view of evidence convincingness?

5. The analysis focuses on binary yes/no questions for simplicity. How well would the proposed framework extend to more open-ended or complex question types? Would the metrics need to change?

6. How robust is the dataset collection methodology to variations in the search engine API, search query formation, and paragraph extraction? Could alternative approaches lead to different distributions of evidence text?

7. What role might the pre-training data of the analyzed models play in their assessments of evidence convincingness? Could contrasts emerge between models trained on different corpora?  

8. How do the identified convincingness correlates compare to factors that influence human perceptions of website credibility? Is alignment with human judgments an appropriate evaluation criterion?

9. The authors suggest possible model training interventions to better align with human credibility assessments. What are some specific techniques that could help models rely less on basic relevance?

10. How could the insights from analyzing conflicting open-domain evidence translate to improving model performance in constrained domains like closed-book QA where data is more structured?
