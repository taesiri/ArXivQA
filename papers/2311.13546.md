# [Enigma: Privacy-Preserving Execution of QAOA on Untrusted Quantum   Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13546)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving protocols tailored specifically for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to enable secure delegation of QAOA programs to untrusted quantum cloud servers. Enigma transforms the original QAOA problem into an unintelligible form such that the resulting quantum circuit and outcomes are obscured to the server. Three variants of Enigma are introduced: Enigma-I conceals problem coefficients and induces bit flips in outcomes; Enigma-II obscures the problem structure by integrating indistinguishable decoy qubits; and Enigma-III hides topology information by regularizing the graph degree. For all protocols, the paper proves that solutions to the original problem can still be recovered. Experiments on IBM quantum devices demonstrate Enigma's efficacy, showing only a small reduction in fidelity (1-13%) compared to standard QAOA, underscoring its readiness for current and near-term quantum computers. Unlike previous generic secure quantum computing schemes, Enigma is specialized for QAOA and avoids reliance on emerging technologies or exponential overheads.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Enigma, a suite of application-specific protocols to protect the privacy of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) programs by perturbing problem coefficients, introducing decoy variables, and regularizing the problem graph structure to make sensitive inputs and outputs unintelligible to untrusted quantum servers.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving schemes tailored specifically for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to enable secure delegation of QAOA programs to untrusted quantum cloud servers. Enigma transforms the QAOA problem itself rather than the circuit, making the input problem and outcomes unintelligible to the server. The paper introduces three variants: Enigma-I conceal coefficients and flips outcome bits; Enigma-II perturbs structure by adding decoy qubits; and Enigma-III regularizes the graph so all qubits have identical connections. For all schemes, the original problem's solution can still be recovered. Experiments on IBM quantum devices demonstrate Enigma's privacy gains come at a small cost to fidelity. Enigma is the first application-specific secure quantum computing protocol deployable on current noisy quantum computers without reliance on emerging technologies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Enigma, a suite of application-specific secure quantum computing techniques tailored for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm that conceal problem details from untrusted quantum servers by transforming inputs and outputs while ensuring correct solutions can still be obtained.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, this paper does not have a specific research question or hypothesis. Rather, it proposes a new framework called "Enigma" for enabling privacy-preserving quantum computation specifically tailored for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). 

The key ideas and contributions are:

1) Proposing Enigma as an application-specific secure quantum computing (SQC) protocol to protect the privacy of QAOA programs run on untrusted quantum computers.

2) Introducing three distinct schemes under Enigma:

- Enigma-I: Obfuscates QAOA coefficients and flips outcome bits to conceal inputs and outputs

- Enigma-II: Embeds decoy qubits to perturb the problem structure

- Enigma-III: Strategically adds decoy qubits to regularize the problem graph

3) Demonstrating that the privacy enhancements of Enigma come at a small cost in terms of reduced fidelity (1-13%) based on experiments on IBM quantum devices.

So in summary, there is no specific research question being investigated. Rather, the authors propose a new technique and framework called Enigma to enable privacy-preserving QAOA computation, along with experimental validation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Enigma, which is presented as the first application-specific secure quantum computing (SQC) protocol specifically designed to safeguard the privacy of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applications executed on untrusted quantum computers. The paper introduces three distinct schemes under Enigma:

1) Enigma-I obscures the values of QAOA coefficients and induces random spin flips in the outputs to conceal both inputs and outputs. 

2) Enigma-II builds on Enigma-I by integrating decoy variables to disturb and mask the problem's structure. 

3) Enigma-III enhances Enigma-II by strategically embedding decoy variables to regularize the problem graph so that all variables have the same degree.

The key points are that Enigma is tailored specifically for QAOA rather than being a generic SQC technique, it is designed to be immediately deployable on current and near-term quantum computers without relying on emerging technologies, and the experiments show it incurs only a minor fidelity reduction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes Enigma, which is the first application-specific secure quantum computing (SQC) protocol tailored specifically for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). It differs from previous SQC works in a few key ways:

1) It does not rely on emerging technologies like quantum networks or multiple non-communicating servers, unlike most blind quantum computing (BQC) protocols. It also avoids the exponential overhead of general quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) techniques. This makes Enigma readily deployable on near-term quantum computers.

2) Rather than trying to protect arbitrary quantum circuits, Enigma operates at the QAOA application layer. It transforms the input problem to conceal sensitive details from the server, representing a shift from post-compilation circuit obfuscations.  

3) The paper introduces three Enigma variants (I, II, and III) that provide progressive privacy improvements by hiding different QAOA assets - coefficients, nodes/variables, and edge connections. Each scheme ensures the original problem can still be solved.

4) Experiments on IBM quantum machines show Enigma provides privacy with minimal fidelity loss (just 1-13%), validating its applicability and advantages over alternatives that rely on error-corrected qubits or exotic hardware.

In summary, Enigma is the first specialized SQC technique for QAOA rather than a general solution, sets itself apart by operating at the problem-level, and demonstrates practical deployability on current quantum computers unlike previous SQC works. This application-centric approach enables usable privacy-preservation for an important near-term quantum algorithm.
