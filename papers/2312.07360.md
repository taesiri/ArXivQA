# [Boosting Latent Diffusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07360)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for high-resolution image synthesis that combines the strengths of diffusion models (DMs), flow matching (FM), and convolutional autoencoders. A small DM generates diverse low-resolution images containing global structure and semantics. Then, an FM model efficiently transports the distribution of these low-resolution latents along a straight conditional probability path to a higher-dimensional latent space corresponding to the high-resolution image. This avoids the inefficiencies of using DMs alone to model the high-dimensional space. Finally, a pre-trained convolutional decoder translates the high-dimensional latent representation to the pixel space, recovering high-frequency details lost during compression. By combining the diversity of DMs, the efficiency of FM for modeling straight trajectories, and the effectiveness of convolutional decoders, the method achieves state-of-the-art high-resolution image synthesis with minimal computational cost. Experiments demonstrate faster training and inference compared to diffusion-based baselines, along with higher image quality, highlighting the synergies obtained by strategically integrating these complementary approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes combining a small diffusion model for generating diverse low-resolution images with a flow matching model for efficiently upsampling the images to higher resolution, achieving state-of-the-art high-resolution image synthesis with minimal computational cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel and effective approach to high-resolution image synthesis by combining the strengths of diffusion models (DMs), flow matching (FM), and convolutional decoders. Specifically:

1) A small diffusion model is used to generate diverse samples and capture the global structure/semantics of images. This allows reducing computational demands during training.

2) A flow matching model is introduced between the diffusion model and convolutional decoder to project the compressed low-resolution representations from the diffusion model to high-resolution latent codes. The flow matching model establishes direct mappings and straight trajectories to the high-resolution space, enabling more efficient training and faster inference. 

3) The convolutional decoder translates the high-resolution latent codes to pixel space effectively. 

In summary, the synergy of diffusion models, flow matching, and convolutional decoders allows high-quality and high-resolution image synthesis with minimal computational cost. The approach is complementary to recent DM enhancements like sampling acceleration and distillation techniques, making it easily integrable.
