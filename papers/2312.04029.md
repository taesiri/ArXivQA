# [Improved Face Representation via Joint Label Classification and   Supervised Contrastive Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Face recognition has made great progress with margin-based softmax losses that enforce intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy. However, there is little work on incorporating the hierarchical semantic information from face clustering to facilitate face recognition. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel framework that jointly optimizes face label classification and supervised contrastive face clustering to introduce cluster knowledge to recognition in two ways:

1. Extend ArcFace with a cluster-guided angular margin (CG-ArcFace) to adjust the within-class feature distribution based on the cluster concentration. Classes with larger concentrations get smaller margins.

2. Propose supervised contrastive face clustering to pull features to the cluster center, and cluster-aligning to align cluster centers with the learnable class centers in the classifier for joint training.

Main Contributions:

- Propose cluster-guided ArcFace to utilize cluster concentration for adjusting the angular margin adaptively.

- Develop supervised contrastive face clustering and cluster-aligning method to jointly optimize clustering and recognition.

- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, IJB-B/C and competitive results on MegaFace, outperforming existing methods. 

- Ablation studies demonstrate the individual and joint improvements from the proposed losses. Feature similarity analysis and face clustering experiments further prove the learned feature representation is improved.

In summary, the paper explores improving face recognition by introducing cluster knowledge through joint classification and clustering, with extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
