## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach that jointly optimizes face label classification and supervised contrastive face clustering to improve face recognition performance. The key ideas are: 1) Extend ArcFace with a cluster-guided angular margin (CG-ArcFace) that adapts the classification boundary based on cluster concentration, assigning larger margins to classes with lower concentration (harder to cluster) to better handle challenging samples. 2) Propose a supervised contrastive clustering loss and cluster alignment process to explicitly optimize clustering objectively, pulling features to cluster centers, as well as aligning cluster centers with classifier weight centers. This helps the model learn better class prototypes. Comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods. Ablation studies validate the individual and joint benefits of the proposed CG-ArcFace loss, clustering loss, and alignment loss. Analyses of feature similarity distributions and face clustering results show the model indeed learns an improved face representation to handle pose, age, and other variations. In summary, joint classification and clustering optimization is highly effective for improving face recognition.
