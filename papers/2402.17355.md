# [RECOST: External Knowledge Guided Data-efficient Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current data-efficient instruction tuning methods rely heavily on the quality of the original synthetic instruction tuning dataset. Issues arise when there is noise in the original dataset, as noisy samples can get selected with higher probability.  
- Metrics like predictive entropy used for sample selection are not reliable enough. Selection based on predictive entropy still results in sampling of noisy data.

Proposed Solution - RECOST:
- Uses external knowledge (relevant examples/paragraphs) to evaluate samples synthesized by language models, through a proposed metric - "in-context-knowledge-based relative predictive entropy".
- Framework has two main components:
   1) External-knowledge-base re-ranking: Ranks samples based on uncertainty without and with external knowledge context. Defines a "relative predictive entropy (RPE)" to capture relative uncertainty.
   2) Diversity-consistent sampling: Ensures diversity of selected subset using a core-set sampling approach that is aware of the uncertainty rankings.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposes RECOST, a novel data-efficient instruction tuning framework for synthetic datasets that uses external knowledge and relative uncertainty.
- Extensive experiments show superiority over previous methods - surpasses full-trained model with just 1% training data on Alpaca and Alpaca-GPT4 datasets over 3 benchmarks.
- Provides a way to do instruction tuning on synthetic datasets without relying solely on the quality of the dataset itself.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes RECOST, a framework that utilizes external knowledge and relative predictive entropy to effectively select high-quality instruction-response pairs from synthetically generated datasets for data-efficient instruction tuning of large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. The paper proposes RECOST, a method to mine high-quality data points from a synthetic dataset for data-efficient instruction tuning. RECOST incorporates external-knowledge-base re-ranking and diversity-consistent sampling.

2. RECOST introduces a concept of in-context-knowledge-based relative predictive entropy to evaluate the quality of synthesized data points using external knowledge examples. This serves as a supplementary metric to the predictive entropy from vanilla language models. 

3. The paper demonstrates through experiments that RECOST is effective in data selection from synthetic instruction datasets. It surpasses the performance of models trained on full datasets using only 1% of the data on benchmarks like AlpacaEval.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating RECOST as an effective data selection method for instruction tuning that integrates external knowledge and diversity sampling. A key novelty is the proposed relative predictive entropy metric.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Instruction tuning - The process of fine-tuning large language models on instruction-response pairs to improve their instruction-following capabilities. A key step in aligning LLMs with human cognition. 

- Data-efficient instruction tuning - Methods to select high-quality instructional data to reduce the data size needed for effective instruction tuning. Aims to maintain model performance with less data.

- Synthetic instruction datasets - Datasets of instruction-response pairs synthesized by having a large language model like ChatGPT or GPT-4 generate responses to prompt instructions. Alpaca and Alpaca-GPT4 are examples.

- Predictive entropy - A metric to measure the uncertainty of a language model over a generated response. Commonly used in data selection but has limitations. 

- External knowledge - Reliable external data, such as from traditional NLP datasets, used to evaluate the quality of synthetic instruction data. Provides an additional source of signal.

- RECOST - The proposed method integrating retrieval of external knowledge, re-ranking based on a relative predictive entropy metric, coreset sampling for diversity, and supervised fine-tuning. Outperforms prior methods.

- In-context learning - Leveraging retrieved demonstrations when evaluating synthetic data quality to improve the signal and robustness. Relies on LLMs' in-context capabilities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "in-context-knowledge-based relative predictive entropy" metric. Can you explain in more detail how this metric is calculated and how it improves over using regular predictive entropy? 

2. The paper utilizes external knowledge from the Flan dataset to evaluate synthetic samples from Alpaca. Why is Flan more reliable than Alpaca? And what advantages does Flan provide over other potential external knowledge sources?

3. The paper introduces a "diversity-consistent sampling" module after re-ranking. Can you explain the algorithm for this sampling module in more detail? How does it balance diversity and uncertainty in the selected subset?

4. The paper shows that retrieval-based demonstrations enhance the stability and robustness of the relative uncertainty metric compared to random demonstrations. What characteristics of the retrieved demonstrations contribute to this improved stability? 

5. Can you analyze the differences in optimal mixed weight $w$ for the Alpaca and Alpaca-gpt4 datasets? Why would Alpaca benefit more from a higher weight on relative uncertainty compared to Alpaca-gpt4?

6. The paper argues that synthetic-knowledge-guided methods have limitations due to potential noise in the synthetic datasets. Can you elaborate on how the proposed method mitigates this issue by using external knowledge? 

7. How feasible is the proposed framework for use with much larger synthetic instruction datasets? Are there any scalability concerns with the retrieval and scoring modules?

8. The performance improvement from 1% to 10% of the Alpaca-gpt4 dataset is less substantial than for the Alpaca dataset. Why might this be the case? 

9. The paper focuses on evaluating generative capabilities through the AlpacaEval benchmark. How might the proposed method perform on closed-domain QA benchmarks instead? Would adjustments be needed?

10. The conclusion mentions limitations around incorporating additional external knowledge. Do you think this concern could be addressed through advances in retrieval methods for harnessing unstructured knowledge sources?
