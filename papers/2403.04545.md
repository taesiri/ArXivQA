# [Improve Generalization Ability of Deep Wide Residual Network with A   Suitable Scaling Factor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04545)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Residual neural networks (ResNets) have shown superior performance but the reasons are not well understood. In particular, the scaling factor $\alpha$ on the residual branch plays a crucial role but there is little theory guiding the choice of $\alpha$. 

- The paper aims to provide an easy-to-implement guideline for choosing $\alpha$ to achieve good generalization performance of ResNets.

Proposed Solution:
- Use neural tangent kernel (NTK) tool to study how different choices of $\alpha$ affect generalization ability of ResNets. Focus on the large depth limit since modern ResNets are very deep.

- Show that constant $\alpha$ leads to a degenerated NTK and hence poor generalization. Even a slowly decaying $\alpha$ still suffers from this problem. 

- Prove that if $\alpha$ decays rapidly as $L^{-\gamma}, \gamma>1/2$, optimized NTK regression can achieve minimax optimal rates under suitable smoothness conditions, suggesting good generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Fully characterize how choice of $\alpha$ affects generalization ability of ResNets using NTK framework. 

- Show that $\alpha$ needs to decay quickly for good generalization, providing theoretical guideline on setting this hyperparameter.

- Simulation studies on synthetic data and image classification tasks (MNIST, CIFAR) confirm the theoretical findings.

- Help explain success of ResNets compared to plain networks by proper tuning of $\alpha$, guided by NTK theory.

In summary, the paper proposes an NTK-based theoretical criteria for choosing the scaling factor $\alpha$ in ResNets to achieve good generalization ability, with support from theory and experiments. The findings help shed light on the working mechanisms of ResNets.
