# [Disintegration and Bayesian Inversion via String Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how the notions of disintegration and Bayesian inversion can be described abstractly using string diagrams and applied in conditional probability theory. 

The key points are:

- Disintegration is the process of extracting a conditional probability distribution (channel) from a joint probability distribution (state). Bayesian inversion takes a channel and a state and produces a channel in the reverse direction.

- The authors provide graphical formulations of disintegration and Bayesian inversion using string diagrams in symmetric monoidal categories with discarding/copying. This allows proving basic results about conditional probability at an abstract level.

- Disintegration and Bayesian inversion are studied in both discrete probability (Kleisli category of distribution monad) and measure-theoretic probability (Kleisli category of Giry monad). Existence results are shown.

- The concepts are illustrated in examples like naive Bayesian classification and a disease-mood model. Likelihood-based disintegration/inversion is also presented.

In summary, the paper introduces abstract graphical definitions of disintegration and Bayesian inversion and shows how they can be applied in conditional probability theory and probabilistic reasoning. The string diagram language allows formulating and proving fundamental results in a clear, graphical way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a graphical, string diagrammatic approach to disintegration and Bayesian inversion in probability theory. Specifically:

- It presents disintegration (extracting a conditional probability from a joint distribution) and Bayesian inversion (inverting a channel to perform inference) abstractly using string diagrams. This allows proving results about these concepts graphically.

- It defines disintegration and Bayesian inversion in both discrete and continuous probability settings. For the latter, it handles subtleties like disintegrations only being defined up to negligible sets. 

- It relates disintegration and Bayesian inversion, showing how they can be defined in terms of each other.

- It proves basic results about conditional independence graphically using the string diagrammatic definitions.

- It shows how conditioning and disintegration are related in a setting that goes beyond causal channels.

- It gives a likelihood-based formulation of disintegration and Bayesian inversion, generalizing common cases involving probability density functions.

Overall, the graphical language allows presenting disintegration and Bayesian inversion in a unified abstract manner while still capturing subtleties like negligible sets. This graphical perspective and the general results derived from it are the main contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces graphical formulations of disintegration and Bayesian inversion in abstract categorical probability theory, relates the two concepts, uses them to prove results about conditional independence, and shows how disintegration can be defined via likelihoods, with an application to Bayesian classification.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on disintegration and Bayesian inversion:

- The paper takes an abstract, categorical approach to disintegration and Bayesian inversion, using string diagrams and symmetric monoidal categories. This is different from much of the existing literature which looks at disintegration and Bayesian inversion more concretely, in specific probabilistic settings like discrete probability or measure theory. 

- The abstract formulation allows the authors to state and prove fundamental results, like the equivalence of various notions of conditional independence, in a general categorical setting. This complements existing concrete results in e.g. measure theory.

- The paper relates disintegration and Bayesian inversion in a systematic way, showing how they can be derived from each other. Other works tend to focus on just one of these notions. 

- The examples illustrate disintegration and Bayesian inversion concretely in probabilistic programming languages and effectus theory. This connects the abstract concepts to recent work on structural probabilistic programming.

- The paper uses "almost equality" of channels to handle disintegration being defined only up to negligible sets. This provides a way to talk about disintegration abstractly while still respecting the subtleties that come up in measure theory.

- Overall, the categorical perspective and the connections drawn between concepts like disintegration and Bayesian inversion make this work a novel contribution compared to much of the existing probabilistic literature. The unifying abstract perspective is a distinctive feature of the paper.

In summary, the paper relates disintegration and Bayesian inversion in a new, categorical way, and leverages this perspective to prove general results and make connections to probabilistic programming. The abstract formulation provides a complementary view to the traditional concrete study of these concepts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several directions for future research:

- Extend the graphical framework to handle non-causal maps and more general disintegration. The authors restricted disintegration to causal states, but disintegration also exists for non-probability measures and non-finite measures. Generalizing the framework could lead to new insights.  

- Relate the graphical conditional independence approach to existing categorical frameworks like Simpson's independence structures. This could help connect the graphical methods to more abstract conditional independence theories.

- Explore other subcategories of the measure-theoretic probability category that admit disintegration, beyond standard Borel spaces. This could expand the applicability of the framework.

- Formally relate disintegration to conditional states obtained via conditioning on predicates/effects. The authors provided an initial result relating disintegration channels to conditioning, but more work could be done here.

- Expand the examples and implementations using the EfProb tool to illustrate the techniques on more complex probabilistic models and inference tasks. This could demonstrate the utility of the graphical disintegration approach.

- Connect the graphical formulations more tightly to probabilistic programming languages to see if these techniques could improve inference capabilities. 

In summary, the main future directions are: generalizing the technical framework, connecting it to other theories, expanding the implementation, and tying it to probabilistic programming to demonstrate practical benefits. The graphical techniques show promise for bringing new insights to disintegration, inversion and conditional independence in probability theory.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the paper in one paragraph: 

The paper presents abstract graphical formulations of the notions of disintegration and Bayesian inversion in conditional probability theory. Disintegration extracts a conditional probability channel from a joint state, while Bayesian inversion produces a channel in the opposite direction from an existing channel. The paper shows how the two notions are related, and uses string diagrams to prove basic results about conditional probability in this abstract setting. It discusses the existence of disintegration and Bayesian inversion in discrete probability, and in measure-theoretic probability via standard Borel spaces and via likelihoods. The usefulness of the two notions is illustrated through several examples, including naive Bayesian classification and a theorem relating conditioning to inference. Overall, the paper provides a categorical perspective on fundamental concepts in conditional probability theory.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a categorical framework for describing disintegration and Bayesian inversion in probabilistic settings. Disintegration extracts conditional probability distributions from joint distributions. Bayesian inversion turns a conditional distribution into one going the opposite direction. These notions are defined abstractly using string diagrams and symmetric monoidal categories. The framework applies both to discrete probability and to measure-theoretic probability, where disintegration is known to be challenging. Several results are proven at this abstract level, including characterizations of conditional independence and crossover influence between variables. Disintegration and Bayesian inversion are also described in terms of likelihoods, yielding a Bayes-like inversion formula. The usefulness of the framework is illustrated via naive Bayesian classification and other examples.

Overall, the paper provides a unified categorical perspective on fundamental concepts in probability theory like disintegration, Bayesian inversion and conditional independence. It shows how these can be studied abstractly with string diagrams and gives general results. The framework is powerful enough to cover discrete probability, where computations are straightforward, as well as measure-theoretic probability, where issues like the potential non-existence of disintegration arise. Several concrete examples demonstrate how the abstract concepts and results can be applied and interpreted in both discrete and continuous probability settings.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is string diagrams to express probabilistic concepts in a graphical way. The authors use string diagrams to model abstract notions like states, channels, marginalization, and disintegration in symmetric monoidal categories. They leverage the graphical nature of string diagrams to reason about and prove results related to conditional probability, including the equivalence of various formulations of conditional independence. The graphical language allows them to formulate disintegration and Bayesian inversion abstractly and relate them. They are able to express the notion of "equality almost everywhere" graphically to characterize Bayesian inversion. Overall, string diagrams provide a powerful graphical language to express probabilistic concepts and reason about them in categorical terms.
