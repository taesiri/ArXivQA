# [Disintegration and Bayesian Inversion via String Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how the notions of disintegration and Bayesian inversion can be described abstractly using string diagrams and applied in conditional probability theory. The key points are:- Disintegration is the process of extracting a conditional probability distribution (channel) from a joint probability distribution (state). Bayesian inversion takes a channel and a state and produces a channel in the reverse direction.- The authors provide graphical formulations of disintegration and Bayesian inversion using string diagrams in symmetric monoidal categories with discarding/copying. This allows proving basic results about conditional probability at an abstract level.- Disintegration and Bayesian inversion are studied in both discrete probability (Kleisli category of distribution monad) and measure-theoretic probability (Kleisli category of Giry monad). Existence results are shown.- The concepts are illustrated in examples like naive Bayesian classification and a disease-mood model. Likelihood-based disintegration/inversion is also presented.In summary, the paper introduces abstract graphical definitions of disintegration and Bayesian inversion and shows how they can be applied in conditional probability theory and probabilistic reasoning. The string diagram language allows formulating and proving fundamental results in a clear, graphical way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a graphical, string diagrammatic approach to disintegration and Bayesian inversion in probability theory. Specifically:- It presents disintegration (extracting a conditional probability from a joint distribution) and Bayesian inversion (inverting a channel to perform inference) abstractly using string diagrams. This allows proving results about these concepts graphically.- It defines disintegration and Bayesian inversion in both discrete and continuous probability settings. For the latter, it handles subtleties like disintegrations only being defined up to negligible sets. - It relates disintegration and Bayesian inversion, showing how they can be defined in terms of each other.- It proves basic results about conditional independence graphically using the string diagrammatic definitions.- It shows how conditioning and disintegration are related in a setting that goes beyond causal channels.- It gives a likelihood-based formulation of disintegration and Bayesian inversion, generalizing common cases involving probability density functions.Overall, the graphical language allows presenting disintegration and Bayesian inversion in a unified abstract manner while still capturing subtleties like negligible sets. This graphical perspective and the general results derived from it are the main contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces graphical formulations of disintegration and Bayesian inversion in abstract categorical probability theory, relates the two concepts, uses them to prove results about conditional independence, and shows how disintegration can be defined via likelihoods, with an application to Bayesian classification.
