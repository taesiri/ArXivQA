# [Machine Learning-Enhanced Aircraft Landing Scheduling under   Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16030)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel machine learning-enhanced framework for aircraft landing scheduling to reduce delays and improve safety. The authors first investigate real-world flight data to identify factors causing delays, notably finding that holding patterns significantly contribute. They then formulate the scheduling problem as a time-constrained traveling salesman problem (TSP-TW), incorporating probabilistic minimum separation time constraints predicted by gradient boosting machines. A multi-stage conditional prediction algorithm leveraging flight events and airspace complexity is used to accurately forecast aircraft arrival time distributions. The TSP-TW optimization model minimizes total landing time with reliability guarantees. Case studies using real flight data at the Atlanta airport demonstrate a 17.2% average reduction in total landing time versus first-come-first-served rules. Key innovations include wide-area arrival time predictions beginning in the en-route phase, reliability-based separation constraints, and integrated machine learning-optimization. Insights on feature importance, uncertainty handling, and model scalability are discussed. Overall, the data-driven scheduling method enhances automation and safety during high-density operations.
