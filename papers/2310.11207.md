# [Can Large Language Models Explain Themselves? A Study of LLM-Generated   Self-Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11207)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the first rigorous assessment of large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate feature attribution explanations, which assign importance scores to input words to explain the model's predictions. Using sentiment analysis on movie reviews as a case study, the authors construct prompts to elicit self-explanations from ChatGPT in two formats - full attributions for all words, and top-k words only. They compare these to occlusion and LIME explanations on faithfulness and agreement metrics. The results show that while none of the explanations outperform significantly per faithfulness, they exhibit high disagreement, suggesting the evaluations may lack power and better techniques are needed. Unique to LLMs, the attributions take on a small number of rounded values rather than precise scores, likely stemming from human-like reasoning. This behavior also makes model predictions insensitive to word removals, affecting some evaluations. Overall, the work underscores the need to rethink traditional evaluation practices when dealing with human-aligned LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically investigates ChatGPT's ability to generate feature attribution explanations for sentiment analysis, compares them to traditional methods like occlusion and LIME, and finds that while ChatGPT's explanations perform similarly on faithfulness metrics, all methods exhibit high disagreement, prompting the need to rethink explanation evaluation practices.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper investigates the ability of large language models like ChatGPT to generate feature attribution explanations, which assign importance scores to input words, for their own predictions. Using sentiment analysis on movie reviews as a case study, the authors construct prompts to elicit self-explanations from ChatGPT in two formats: full attribution scores for all words, and top-k highlights. They compare these to traditional explanation techniques like occlusion and LIME on faithfulness and agreement metrics. The results show that while ChatGPT's self-explanations perform similarly to traditional ones in evaluations, they differ greatly from them in terms of agreement. More importantly, limitations are revealed in current evaluation practices for interpretability, suggesting the need to rethink how we understand and assess explanations for models with human-like reasoning abilities. Overall, this initial study demonstrates the feasibility of generating self-explanations from LLMs like ChatGPT, while highlighting open challenges and opportunities for future work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper systematically investigates ChatGPT's ability to generate feature attribution explanations for its predictions on sentiment analysis, compares them to traditional methods like LIME and occlusion using faithfulness and agreement metrics, and finds that while ChatGPT's explanations perform similarly they exhibit distinct characteristics like rounded attribution values, prompting rethinking of current evaluation practices.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How good are the automatically generated self-explanations produced by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT? 

Specifically, the authors investigate the quality of feature attribution explanations generated by ChatGPT to explain its predictions on a sentiment analysis task. They compare ChatGPT's self-generated explanations to traditional explanation techniques like occlusion and LIME across various metrics. The goal is to understand if ChatGPT's explanations are faithful and meaningful compared to existing methods.

The paper does not have an explicit hypothesis stated, but the implicit hypothesis seems to be: ChatGPT's self-explanations will perform comparably to traditional explanations like occlusion and LIME in terms of faithfulness. The authors test this by evaluating the explanations on metrics like sufficiency, comprehensiveness, decision flip rate, etc.

In summary, the central research question is assessing the quality of ChatGPT's self-generated explanations compared to traditional methods, with an implicit hypothesis that they will show similar faithfulness. The paper conducts experiments and evaluations to test this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic investigation and analysis of the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate feature attribution explanations, also known as saliency maps or feature importance explanations. Specifically, the authors:

- Construct prompts to elicit self-explanations from ChatGPT in two paradigms: explain-then-predict (generating attribution scores first, then making a prediction) and predict-and-explain (making a prediction first, then generating attributions). 

- Evaluate the faithfulness of these self-explanations using metrics like sufficiency, comprehensiveness, decision flip rate, etc. and compare them to traditional methods like occlusion and LIME.

- Find that while self-explanations perform comparably on faithfulness metrics, they exhibit high disagreement with traditional methods. Also, both attribution values and predictions are rounded and insensitive.

- Discuss implications like the need to rethink evaluation practices for LLMs and highlight opportunities for future work on eliciting and assessing self-explanations.

In summary, this is the first rigorous study focused specifically on evaluating feature attribution self-explanations from LLMs like ChatGPT, providing novel analysis and insights into this emerging capability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper provides a novel contribution by being the first to systematically study and evaluate feature attribution explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The key findings are:

- LLM-generated explanations perform comparably to traditional methods like occlusion and LIME on faithfulness metrics, but differ greatly on agreement metrics. This suggests there may be better explanations not captured by current methods.

- LLM explanations exhibit "roundedness" in attribution values and prediction changes, limiting current evaluation techniques. New evaluation strategies like human studies may be needed. 

- Explanations hurt LLM accuracy, aligning with prior work showing tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability.

Relative to prior work on interpretability for LLMs, this paper provides more rigorous quantitative evaluation of explanation faithfulness and agreement. It also highlights unique challenges like the roundedness issue. The findings prompt rethinking evaluation and elicitation techniques for LLM self-explanations.

Overall, this is an important first step in understanding and assessing the promise and limitations of LLM self-explanations. It paves the way for future work to build better techniques tailored to these models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Developing better ways to elicit self-explanations from large language models. The current solution in the paper may not be optimal, so exploring other prompting strategies could lead to improved self-explanations.

- Rethinking the evaluation practices for self-explanations. The standard faithfulness evaluation metrics used in the paper did not effectively differentiate between good and bad explanations. New evaluation approaches like carefully designed human studies may be needed. 

- Evaluating other large language models besides ChatGPT, such as GPT-4, Bard, and Claude. Comparative studies could reveal insights into how different models introspect and explain themselves.

- Studying other types of explanations like counterfactuals and concept-based explanations. Now that the feasibility of generating self-explanations is shown, extending the analysis to other explanation types is a natural next step.

- Ensuring self-explanations are not manipulable or hiding fairness issues before deployment. As these explanations become more usable, it's important to identify and mitigate any potential harms.

In summary, the main suggested directions are improving how self-explanations are elicited and evaluated, expanding the analysis to other models and explanation types, and conducting safety analyses before real-world deployment.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares LLM-generated self-explanations to traditional methods like occlusion and LIME. What are the key differences in how these methods generate explanations? What are the trade-offs between them?

2. The prompts designed to elicit self-explanations from the LLM are crucial. How were these prompts engineered? What considerations went into their design? How could they potentially be improved?

3. The paper finds that LLM-generated explanations have attribution values clustered into a few "levels" rather than finely grained scores. Why might this occur? Does this reflect limitations in the LLM's reasoning or the evaluative metrics? 

4. Evaluation metrics like deletion rank correlation seem poorly suited for assessing LLM-generated explanations. What properties of the explanations and model predictions cause this? How could better suited metrics be designed?

5. The paper uses text formatting like Python tuples to elicit structurally consistent explanations from the LLM. How essential is this? Could more natural language prompts work as well? What are the trade-offs?

6. The paper finds that LLM-generated explanations are insensitive to minor input perturbations. Is this a positive reflection of robust reasoning or a limitation in explanability? How does this connect to human cognitive biases?

7. What assumptions does the paper make about the relationship between explanations and model predictions/internals? How valid are these assumptions for LLMs?

8. The paper uses sentiment analysis tasks. How would the characteristics of LLM-generated explanations differ for other tasks like summarization or translation?

9. How is the alignment of LLMs to human reasoning and behavior shaping their explanability? Does this introduce anthropomorphic biases into the analysis? 

10. The paper analyzes feature attribution explanations. How would LLM-generated counterfactuals or conceptual explanations differ? What unique insights or challenges might arise?
