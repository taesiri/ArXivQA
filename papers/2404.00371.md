# [From Learning to Analytics: Improving Model Efficacy with Goal-Directed   Client Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) trains a global model across distributed clients without centralized data collection. However, existing works focus on optimizing the training efficiency rather than the efficacy of the trained model.  
- Evaluating and improving the trained model's efficacy using clients' local data is crucial but faces challenges due to system/data heterogeneities among clients.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose two closed-loop frameworks - FL&Federated Analytics (FA) and FL&Democratized Analytics (DA) - to evaluate and enhance the trained model's efficacy.
- FA uploads test opinions to a central server while DA exchanges opinions in a decentralized network.
- Formulate a goal-directed client selection problem to select optimal clients that maximize average test opinions on the trained model. Converts to a stochastic multi-armed bandit (SMAB) problem.
- Propose Quick-Init UCB algorithm under FL&FA framework where the player (server) selects client subsets (arms).
- Propose Belief Propagation-UCB (BP-UCB) algorithm under FL&DA framework where clients are players selecting themselves as arms.

Main Contributions:
- First work to propose closed-loop frameworks for evaluating and enhancing efficacy of trained models in federated learning.
- Novel goal-directed client selection formulation to handle system/data heterogeneities and maximize model efficacy.
- Quick-Init UCB and BP-UCB algorithms to solve the SMAB problem under the two frameworks, with regret bounds.
- Extensive experiments show near optimal performance within 1.44% and 3.12% optimality gap for the two algorithms.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in improving model efficacy in federated learning through novel goal-directed selection and closed-loop analytics frameworks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes two closed-loop frameworks called federated learning and federated/democratized analytics to evaluate and improve a trained global model's efficacy, then formulates and solves a goal-directed client selection problem under these frameworks to account for system and data heterogeneity in the federated learning process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes two closed-loop model analytics frameworks - the FL&FA (federated learning and federated analytics) framework and the FL&DA (federated learning and democratized analytics) framework - to evaluate and improve the efficacy of the trained global model in federated learning. 

2. Based on these frameworks, it studies a goal-directed client selection problem to select the optimal subset of clients for model training by formulating it as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. This allows tackling the system and data heterogeneity in federated learning.

3. It puts forth two algorithms - Quick-Init UCB algorithm under the FL&FA framework and BP-UCB algorithm under the FL&DA framework - to solve the formulated stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and select the optimal client subset.

4. It provides a theoretical analysis of the two proposed algorithms by deriving the regret bounds, which increase logarithmically over time, showing that they are asymptotically optimal.

5. It validates the performance of Quick-Init UCB and BP-UCB algorithms through extensive simulations, demonstrating that they achieve near optimal performance with marginal optimality gaps within 1.44% and 3.12%, respectively.

In summary, the key contribution is designing goal-directed client selection frameworks and algorithms to improve global model efficacy in heterogeneous federated learning systems.

The paper proposes goal-directed client selection frameworks called FL&FA and FL&DA to improve the efficacy of federated learning models. It formulates the client selection problem as a SMAB problem to balance exploitation and exploration. Algorithms called Quick-Init UCB and BP-UCB are proposed to solve the SMAB problem under the centralized FL&FA and decentralized FL&DA frameworks respectively. Regret bound analysis is provided for both algorithms. The key focus is on model analytics and goal-directed client selection to deal with system and data heterogeneity in federated learning.
