# [SSAP: A Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch for Comprehensive Disruption   of Monocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Navigation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11515)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is important for autonomous vehicles and robotics for functions like obstacle avoidance, object detection, etc. 
- MDE models based on CNNs and Transformers have shown vulnerability to adversarial attacks which can compromise safety.
- Existing adversarial patch attacks on MDE have limitations - they impact only small regions, require retraining for different objects, or are only effective at fixed camera-object distances.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Shape-Sensitive Adversarial Patch (SSAP) that can induce comprehensive disruption of MDE by either distorting estimated distances or making objects seem to disappear.
- The patch generation uses a pre-trained object detector to enable adapting the patch to different object scales and distances from the camera.
- A novel penalized loss function is introduced to expand the impact region of the patch beyond just the overlapping pixels.

Key Contributions:
- SSAP can fully hide target objects or significantly alter their perceived depth, impacting ~99% of the target region.
- Demonstrates vulnerability of Transformer-based MDE models to patch attacks with mean depth error of 0.59.
- Achieves higher depth error (0.55) and impact region (99%) compared to prior patch attacks on CNN-based MDE. 
- Ablation study validates that the proposed penalized loss enhances the attack impact.
- Attack methodology is generic and can target different object types.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective adversarial patch attack that induces comprehensive disruption of both CNN and Transformer based MDE models by concealing objects or distorting their depth.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a shape-sensitive adversarial patch called SSAP that is designed to comprehensively disrupt monocular depth estimation in autonomous navigation applications by either distorting estimated distances or creating the illusion that an object has disappeared.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing a shape-sensitive adversarial patch (SSAP) designed to comprehensively disrupt monocular depth estimation (MDE) by either distorting estimated distances or creating the illusion of objects disappearing. 

2) Leveraging information from a pre-trained detector during patch generation to make the patch robust to varying scales and distances from the camera.

3) Introducing a novel penalized loss function to enhance the efficiency of the adversarial patch and expand its impact region. 

4) Demonstrating the vulnerability of transformer-based MDE models to patch attacks, with SSAP achieving significant depth estimation errors and influencing over 99% of the target region.

5) Achieving a high mean depth estimation error exceeding 0.5 and impacting nearly 99% of the target region for CNN-based MDE using the proposed approach.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing a shape-sensitive adversarial patch (SSAP) that can effectively and comprehensively disrupt both CNN and transformer-based monocular depth estimation models by distorting depth perception for targeted objects.

The paper introduces a shape-sensitive adversarial patch (SSAP) designed to attack monocular depth estimation models, including CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures. The key goal is to either distort the estimated distances of target objects like vehicles and pedestrians or create the illusion that they disappear entirely. The patch generation leverages a YOLOv4 object detector and a specialized penalized depth loss to expand the patch's sphere of influence. The performance is evaluated using metrics like the mean depth error and ratio of affected region. An ablation study demonstrates the utility of the proposed loss function. Overall, the key focus is on adversarial attacks against depth estimation in the context of autonomous driving and navigation.
