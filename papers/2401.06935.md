# [MiTTenS: A Dataset for Evaluating Misgendering in Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06935)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation systems can produce errors that result in misgendering, which refers to referring to someone in a way that does not reflect their gender identity. This causes harm.  
- Evaluating potential misgendering harms in foundation models is challenging due to contamination, limitations of automated evaluation methods, and evolving sociocultural norms around gender.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce the Misgendered in Translation Test Set (MiTTenS), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating misgendering harms in 26 languages when translating into and out of English. 
- The dataset contains 13 evaluation sets targeting different linguistic phenomena that can cause misgendering, including coreference, gender agreement, and gender-specific words. The data combines handcrafted, synthetic, and natural examples.
- Automated scoring based on pronoun expression enables scaled evaluation for translation into English. Translation out of English requires human evaluation.  

Key Contributions:
- New dataset with wide language coverage to measure potential misgendering harms in translation
- Multiple test sets targeting different error types, with mix of handcrafted, synthetic, and natural examples
- Automated evaluation protocol for translation into English based on pronoun expression
- Analysis of dedicated and foundation model translation systems showing weaknesses even in high resource languages
- Dataset and analysis highlight need for improved translation quality to avoid misgendering harms

In summary, the paper introduces a meticulously constructed benchmark dataset to measure misgendering harms in machine translation across diverse languages. Detailed evaluations demonstrate that current systems still exhibit concerning weaknesses, highlighting the need for further improvements to avoid potential real-world harms from translation errors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new dataset, MiTTenS, for evaluating potential misgendering harms in 26 languages when translating into and out of English using both dedicated machine translation systems and foundation models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new dataset called Misgendered in Translation Test Set (MiTTenS). The key points about MiTTenS are:

- It is designed to evaluate the potential for misgendering harms when translating text into and out of English across 26 languages from different language families and scripts. 

- It contains multiple evaluation sets targeting different linguistic phenomena that can lead to misgendering errors in translation, such as co-reference, gender agreement, and gender-specific words. 

- The evaluation sets include a mix of handcrafted, synthetic, and natural passages from multiple domains. The use of synthetic data helps avoid contamination from public internet sources.

- It enables both automated and human evaluation protocols to precisely measure translation quality with respect to avoiding misgendering.

- The authors demonstrate the usefulness of MiTTenS by evaluating various machine translation systems and foundation models, showing that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit misgendering errors.

In summary, MiTTenS is a new benchmark dataset tailored to rigorously measure and drive progress on avoiding misgendering harms in machine translation across languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Misgendering harms - The paper focuses on evaluating potential misgendering harms in machine translation systems, where misgendering refers to referring to someone in a way that does not reflect their gender identity.

- Evaluation datasets - The paper introduces a new dataset called MiTTenS (Misgendered in Translation Test Set) for evaluating misgendering harms in 26 languages when translating into and out of English.

- Automated evaluation - The MiTTenS datasets enable automated evaluation by having only a single gendered entity in the source text and scanning for gendered pronouns in the English translation.

- Targeted error patterns - The datasets contain examples targeting specific linguistic phenomena that can lead to misgendering, such as coreference, gender agreement, late binding of gender information, and gender encoded in nouns. 

- Synthetic data - Some of the datasets use synthetically generated passages to avoid contamination from existing public datasets.

- Foundation models - The paper demonstrates using MiTTenS to evaluate potential misgendering both in dedicated machine translation models and large foundation models like GPT-4.

- Disaggregated evaluation - The paper advocates for reporting performance disaggregated across languages, evaluation sets, and gender to enable targeted improvements.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces multiple evaluation sets targeting different linguistic phenomena that can lead to misgendering harms. What were some of the key phenomena targeted and what motivated focusing on those specific cases?

2. The paper utilizes both hand-crafted and synthetic data passages. What are some of the tradeoffs between these two approaches and why utilize both? What role did professional translators play in the dataset creation?

3. The paper explicitly avoided using sources like Translated Wikipedia Biographies that language models may have seen during pre-training due to potential contamination issues. Can you elaborate more on the contamination concerns and mitigation strategies such as canaries and data versioning? 

4. The gender information in pronouns facilitates automated evaluation for the 2en tasks. What makes evaluating the 2xx tasks more challenging and time-intensive? What evaluation protocols do the authors suggest for those cases?

5. Table 2 highlights differences between languages in terms of level of digital resources. What special considerations went into coverage of traditionally under-represented languages and how might the encoded in nouns evaluation set help address this?

6. The paper evaluates dedicated translation systems as well as foundation models. What differences would you expect to see in the potential for gender-related harms between these two categories of models and does the analysis bear this intuition out?

7. The analysis highlights weaknesses even in high resource languages, suggesting empirical evaluation is critical. What implications does this have for how we measure and address issues around fairness and representation when expanding to new languages and domains?

8. The paper acknowledges remaining challenges around contested perspectives on gender across languages/cultures. How might the approach taken help address those issues or where does more research need to be focused?

9. The paper focuses narrowly on misgendering harms, acknowledging wider potential risks exist around translation systems. What considerations would you highlight if attempting to broaden the evaluation to additional risks or harms?

10. The limitations highlight that not all gender-related harms may have been covered. What suggestions do you have for how future iterations could expand coverage of underrepresented identities and perspectives?
