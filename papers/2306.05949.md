# [Evaluating the Social Impact of Generative AI Systems in Systems and   Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05949)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is to propose a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems across different modalities like text, image, audio, and video. The key goals of the paper seem to be:

- Define categories for evaluating social impact in base technical systems and in people/society. This provides a standardized way to assess social impacts across different generative AI systems.

- Analyze popular evaluation methods for each category and their limitations. This reviews current practices and gaps to inform future research on evaluations. 

- Provide recommendations for mitigating harmful impacts in society. This goes beyond just evaluating impacts to suggest ways to address them.

- Make social impact evaluation more accessible. The paper aims to lower barriers to engaging with evaluating social impacts of AI. 

So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that a systematic framework is needed to standardize evaluation of the social impacts of generative AI across modalities. The paper proposes such a framework, reviews current evaluation practices, and provides recommendations to make evaluations more robust and mitigation of impacts more effective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems across modalities. The main contributions are:

1. A framework for evaluating social impacts of generative AI systems in two categories: evaluations for the technical base system, and evaluations for impacts on people and society when deployed. 

2. For the technical system, it defines 7 categories that can be evaluated: bias/stereotypes, cultural values, disparate performance, privacy/data protection, financial costs, environmental costs, and data moderation labor costs. It suggests evaluation methods for each and analyzes limitations.

3. For impacts on people/society, it defines 5 categories: trustworthiness, inequality/marginalization/violence, concentration of authority, labor/creativity, and ecosystem/environment. It suggests evaluations and interventions for each.

4. The paper analyzes the broader context and challenges of evaluating social impacts, including the importance of context, choosing evaluations, and limitations. 

5. It provides a synthesis of potential social impacts across modalities (text, image, audio, video) based on expert workshops.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive framework to standardize evaluation of the social impacts of generative AI systems, both technically and societally. The paper aims to make these complex evaluations more accessible.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review, the key point of this paper seems to be proposing a framework for evaluating the social impacts of generative AI systems across modalities. The paper suggests evaluating impacts in two categories: what can be evaluated in the technical system itself, and what can be evaluated in people and society when the system is deployed. It provides high-level categories for evaluation in each area and suggests methods, limitations, and mitigations. The goal is to move toward standardizing evaluation of generative AI's social impacts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in evaluating the social impacts of generative AI systems:

- Scope and comprehensiveness - This paper presents a broad framework for evaluating social impacts across modalities (text, image, audio, video) and both for the technical system itself as well as impacts on people and society. Many existing papers focus on evaluating specific risks or harms for a particular modality like language models. Covering social impacts more holistically makes this stand out.

- Focus on base systems - The technical evaluation framework focuses on base systems without a specific application or sector. This is different from many audit or assessment frameworks that require knowing the deployment context. Evaluating general capabilities systems is an important challenge highlighted in the paper.

- Emphasis on society and people - In addition to the technical system evaluations, the paper includes an in-depth look at evaluating impacts on society. This connects well to risk taxonomies but goes further in proposing ways to actually evaluate real-world impacts. Other papers tend to focus more narrowly on the AI system.

- Actionable - The paper aims to make social impact evaluations more accessible by providing concrete evaluation methods, limitations, and mitigation steps. The forthcoming evaluation repository to collect examples is also notable. Other conceptual papers on AI and society tend to be more theoretical.

- Collaborative approach - The methodology gathered input from 30 experts across different backgrounds. Many research papers in this space are written by small teams within one lab or organization. The collaborative workshop approach results in a more comprehensive synthesis.

- Living document - The intent to continuously update the paper based on community feedback will keep it relevant as a resource. The landscape of social impacts and evaluations will evolve quickly.

Overall, I would say this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field by advancing both the conceptual framing and practical execution of holistic social impact evaluations for generative AI. The comprehensive scope, focus on base systems, inclusion of societal impacts, actionable recommendations, collaborative methodology, and intent to update are distinctive features that build on related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper proposes a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems, and suggests several areas for future research:

- Conducting a more rigorous analysis of gaps in evaluations across modalities and categories. The authors plan to provide this analysis in an updated version of the paper. 

- Creating an evaluation repository for the AI research community to contribute existing evaluations along the categories outlined in the paper. This would help standardize evaluation methods.

- Expanding evaluation methods and metrics for each category of social impact. For example, developing better ways to evaluate cultural values, improving tools for evaluating training data, and creating standardized carbon emissions reporting.

- Expanding evaluation categories as new issues and impacts arise, such as evaluating impacts on future generations or existential risk.

- Developing participatory methodologies to include impacted groups and communities in evaluations. For example, engaging focus groups and conducting red team testing simulations.

- Considering evaluation ethics and how to obtain meaningful consent from impacted groups.

- Evaluating long-term and indirect societal impacts that are hard to measure directly, such as effects on the economy and labor markets. 

- Expanding evaluations to be more inclusive of different geographic and cultural contexts. For example, evaluating models in multiple languages.

In summary, the authors call for ongoing research to expand the categories, improve evaluation methods, address gaps, and increase participation of impacted groups in evaluating generative AI systems across modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems across modalities, including text, image, audio, and video. It defines two categories for evaluation: impacts on the technical system itself, and impacts on people and society when the system is deployed. For the technical system, it outlines seven categories to evaluate: bias, stereotypes and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data/content moderation labor costs. It suggests methods for evaluation in each of these categories. For evaluating impact on people and society, it outlines five categories: trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem/environment. It includes recommendations for mitigating harm in each of these societal categories. The goal is to provide researchers, developers, auditors and policymakers with a standard framework to evaluate the social impacts of generative AI across modalities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems across modalities. The framework divides impact evaluations into two categories: 1) evaluating the technical system components like training data, model, infrastructure, etc. and 2) evaluating impact on people and society when systems are deployed. 

For evaluating the technical system, the paper outlines seven categories: bias, stereotypes and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data/content moderation labor costs. It suggests evaluation methods for each category and analyzes limitations of current evaluations. For evaluating impact on people and society, it proposes five categories: trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and environment. Each category includes subcategories with recommendations for mitigating harm. The goal is to provide a standard approach for evaluating social impact of generative AI across modalities and system components.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems. The authors convened workshops with experts from industry, academia, civil society, and government to create categories for evaluating social impact in two areas: 1) impacts able to be evaluated in the technical system itself, and 2) impacts on people and society when systems are deployed. 

For impacts in the technical system, they define seven categories: bias, stereotypes, and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data and content moderation labor costs. They suggest evaluation methods for each category and analyze limitations.

For impacts on people and society, they propose five categories: trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization, and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and environment. Each has subcategories with recommendations for mitigating harm. 

The framework aims to provide a starting point for evaluating social impacts across modalities and system components, analyze gaps, and make evaluations more accessible. The authors plan to create a repository for contributing evaluations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the need for a standard approach to evaluating the social impacts of generative AI systems. The main problems/questions it is trying to address are:

- There is currently no consensus or standard set of categories for evaluating the social impacts of generative AI systems across modalities (text, image, video, audio).

- Existing evaluations tend to be narrow or limited in scope, focusing on specific harms or modalities. There needs to be a more holistic approach.

- Evaluations need to consider both the technical system components as well as impacts on people and society. Many existing evaluations focus only on one or the other.

- There is a lack of evaluations examining base/foundation models that have no predetermined application or use case. But it's important to evaluate potential social impacts before deployment.

- Evaluations need to be applied consistently across modalities and systems to allow comparison.

- There are gaps in coverage of certain social impact categories that need more attention.

- Evaluations must consider different cultural contexts and avoid being Western/Euro-centric. 

- There needs to be a centralized repository/resource for sharing evaluation methods to make them more accessible.

In summary, the paper is aiming to propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating social impacts of generative AI that addresses these limitations and gaps of current approaches. The goal is to standardize evaluation to some degree to allow for better understanding and comparison of different systems.
