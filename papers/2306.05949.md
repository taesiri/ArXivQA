# [Evaluating the Social Impact of Generative AI Systems in Systems and   Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05949)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is to propose a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems across different modalities like text, image, audio, and video. The key goals of the paper seem to be:- Define categories for evaluating social impact in base technical systems and in people/society. This provides a standardized way to assess social impacts across different generative AI systems.- Analyze popular evaluation methods for each category and their limitations. This reviews current practices and gaps to inform future research on evaluations. - Provide recommendations for mitigating harmful impacts in society. This goes beyond just evaluating impacts to suggest ways to address them.- Make social impact evaluation more accessible. The paper aims to lower barriers to engaging with evaluating social impacts of AI. So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that a systematic framework is needed to standardize evaluation of the social impacts of generative AI across modalities. The paper proposes such a framework, reviews current evaluation practices, and provides recommendations to make evaluations more robust and mitigation of impacts more effective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the social impact of generative AI systems across modalities. The main contributions are:1. A framework for evaluating social impacts of generative AI systems in two categories: evaluations for the technical base system, and evaluations for impacts on people and society when deployed. 2. For the technical system, it defines 7 categories that can be evaluated: bias/stereotypes, cultural values, disparate performance, privacy/data protection, financial costs, environmental costs, and data moderation labor costs. It suggests evaluation methods for each and analyzes limitations.3. For impacts on people/society, it defines 5 categories: trustworthiness, inequality/marginalization/violence, concentration of authority, labor/creativity, and ecosystem/environment. It suggests evaluations and interventions for each.4. The paper analyzes the broader context and challenges of evaluating social impacts, including the importance of context, choosing evaluations, and limitations. 5. It provides a synthesis of potential social impacts across modalities (text, image, audio, video) based on expert workshops.In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive framework to standardize evaluation of the social impacts of generative AI systems, both technically and societally. The paper aims to make these complex evaluations more accessible.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review, the key point of this paper seems to be proposing a framework for evaluating the social impacts of generative AI systems across modalities. The paper suggests evaluating impacts in two categories: what can be evaluated in the technical system itself, and what can be evaluated in people and society when the system is deployed. It provides high-level categories for evaluation in each area and suggests methods, limitations, and mitigations. The goal is to move toward standardizing evaluation of generative AI's social impacts.
