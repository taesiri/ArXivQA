# [To Fuse or Not to Fuse: Measuring Consistency in Multi-Sensor Fusion for   Aerial Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Aerial robots operating close to structures for tasks like inspection or manipulation require very precise state estimation to avoid crashes. 
- Many sensors like GPS or visual odometry degrade or fail in these scenarios due to occlusions or unsuitable environments.  
- Naively fusing all available sensor data can reduce accuracy when some sensors provide corrupted data.
- Determining which sensors are currently reliable is critical.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a metric called Cramér distance to measure the consistency between estimates from different sensors. 
- Design a parallel redundant state estimation framework treating each sensor reading as an individual process with the consistency metric applied.
- Use the metric to find consensus among sensors to determine which ones are currently reliable. 
- Selectively fuse only the reliable sensor estimates for improved robustness and accuracy.

Contributions:
- Evaluation of multiple metric options; Cramér distance selected as most effective.
- Introduction of sensor fusion approach using consistency metric to determine which sensors to fuse or not fuse. 
- Demonstrated improved accuracy over naive fusion of all sensors in real-world experiments including indoor-outdoor transitions and bridge inspection scenarios.

In summary, the key innovation is using a consistency metric to selectively determine which sensors to fuse in order to create a robust state estimator for aerial robots operating in challenging real-world scenarios with sensor degradation and failures. The proposed approach and experiments showcase improved performance over previous approaches.
