# [To Fuse or Not to Fuse: Measuring Consistency in Multi-Sensor Fusion for   Aerial Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Aerial robots operating close to structures for tasks like inspection or manipulation require very precise state estimation to avoid crashes. 
- Many sensors like GPS or visual odometry degrade or fail in these scenarios due to occlusions or unsuitable environments.  
- Naively fusing all available sensor data can reduce accuracy when some sensors provide corrupted data.
- Determining which sensors are currently reliable is critical.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a metric called Cramér distance to measure the consistency between estimates from different sensors. 
- Design a parallel redundant state estimation framework treating each sensor reading as an individual process with the consistency metric applied.
- Use the metric to find consensus among sensors to determine which ones are currently reliable. 
- Selectively fuse only the reliable sensor estimates for improved robustness and accuracy.

Contributions:
- Evaluation of multiple metric options; Cramér distance selected as most effective.
- Introduction of sensor fusion approach using consistency metric to determine which sensors to fuse or not fuse. 
- Demonstrated improved accuracy over naive fusion of all sensors in real-world experiments including indoor-outdoor transitions and bridge inspection scenarios.

In summary, the key innovation is using a consistency metric to selectively determine which sensors to fuse in order to create a robust state estimator for aerial robots operating in challenging real-world scenarios with sensor degradation and failures. The proposed approach and experiments showcase improved performance over previous approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a metric to measure consistency between sensors for aerial robots, then uses this metric in a consensus-based framework to selectively fuse only consistent sensors, demonstrating improved robustness over naive sensor fusion approaches in real-world experiments with sensor noise and dropouts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Evaluation of multiple metrics for multi-sensor consistency estimation. The paper evaluates mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), Kulback-Leibler divergence (KL), and Cramér von Mises distance (CM) as potential metrics. Through experiments, the authors select CM distance as the most suitable metric.

2. Introduction of an effective sensor fusion framework in the presence of dropouts and divergence. The paper proposes a consensus-finding scheme that uses the CM metric to choose which sensors to fuse or not fuse in order to get a robust state estimate. 

3. Real-world experimental evaluation in challenging scenarios. The proposed approach is evaluated in indoor experiments with artificially corrupted data as well as outdoor experiments involving transitions between indoors and outdoors and flying under a bridge. The results demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the selective sensor fusion approach compared to naive fusion.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and evaluation of a robust sensor fusion approach that can detect inconsistent sensors and selectively fuse only reliable sensor data to get an accurate state estimate even in challenging real-world scenarios involving sensor degradation and dropouts. The key ideas are the CM consistency metric and the consensus-based selective fusion scheme.

The paper introduces consistency metrics to determine which sensors to fuse in a multi-sensor state estimation framework for aerial robots. It evaluates different metrics like PCC, MAE, KL divergence, and settles on the CM distance as being the most suitable. This metric is then used in a consensus finding scheme to selectively fuse only consistent sensor measurements, making the state estimator robust. The approach is demonstrated with real-world experiments involving transitions between indoors and outdoors and flying under a bridge while performing non-destructive testing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes several metrics for measuring consistency between sensors, including MAE, PCC, KL divergence, and CM distance. What are the key differences between these metrics and what made CM distance the best choice? What are some limitations of using CM distance?

2. The paper mentions setting a threshold of 0.1 m/s for the CM distance metric when determining which sensors to fuse. What is the rationale behind choosing this particular value? How sensitive is the performance of the overall algorithm to this threshold value?

3. The local state estimation graph and the sensor transform estimation graphs become co-dependent whenever position measurements are used as local constraints. Why does this happen and what is the implication? Does this introduce any problems or limitations?

4. In the sensor selection process, how exactly are decisions made in the degenerate case when only two sensors remain and they disagree? Walk through this process step-by-step and highlight any potential issues.  

5. The outdoor experiments show that the same CM distance threshold works well for some datasets but not others. What factors might determine what an appropriate threshold value is? How could the threshold be set automatically?

6. When validating the proposed approach, what would be the advantages and disadvantages of using simulated data vs real-world data? Are the results convincing and what additional experiments could be run?

7. The proposed fusion approach seems sensitive to very noisy IMU measurements. How big of a limitation is this and how could the approach be made more robust to poor quality inertial data?

8. What might be some of the computational and memory costs of running parallel estimation graphs? Could any optimizations or approximations be made to improve efficiency?

9. How well would the proposed sensor fusion approach extend to fusing additional sensing modalities beyond just IMUs, GNSS, visual odometry, etc.? What challenges might arise?

10. A key contribution is the ability to detect inconsistencies and isolate poor performing sensors. What other applications might this capability enable for state estimation or robotics in general?
