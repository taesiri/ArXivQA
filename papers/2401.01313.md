# [A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01313)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of techniques for mitigating hallucination in large language models (LLMs). Hallucination refers to the tendency of LLMs to generate factually incorrect or ungrounded content despite their fluency. This poses issues for deploying LLMs safely into real-world applications. 

The paper first discusses recent advances in detecting hallucinations, such as the mFACT metric and frameworks leveraging self-contradiction. It then introduces a taxonomy categorizing over 30 hallucination mitigation techniques based on factors like dataset usage, task type, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. 

The main categories in the taxonomy are prompt engineering methods and model development approaches. Prompt engineering covers techniques like retrieval augmented generation (before, during and after text generation), self-refinement through reasoning and feedback loops, and prompt tuning. Model development methods include new decoding strategies to guide text generation, utilization of knowledge graphs, novel loss functions to optimize for faithfulness, and supervised fine-tuning procedures. 

For each category and technique, the paper summarizes the key idea, contributions, limitations, and evaluations conducted. Tables are provided listing details like tasks, metrics, models, and datasets used for every covered paper. 

The main contributions are: (i) a systematic taxonomy of hallucination mitigation techniques spanning prompt engineering and model development, (ii) a synthesis of essential features of these techniques to guide future research, and (iii) an analysis of inherent challenges and limitations along with potential solutions.

Overall, the paper delivers a solid foundation for approaching the pressing issue of hallucinations in LLMs by organizing and contrasting the diverse solutions proposed so far. It points to future work needed in aspects like hybrid models, unsupervised learning, and studying societal impacts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of over thirty-two techniques for mitigating hallucination in large language models, categorized based on parameters such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It introduces a systematic taxonomy to categorize hallucination mitigation techniques for large language models (LLMs), including vision language models (VLMs). This taxonomy classifies the diverse approaches into branches such as prompt engineering, model development, etc.

2. It synthesizes the essential features characterizing these mitigation techniques, providing a structured foundation to guide future research within the domain of hallucination mitigation. 

3. It deliberates on the limitations and challenges inherent in these techniques, accompanied by potential solutions and proposed directions for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena in LLMs.

In essence, the paper consolidates and organizes the landscape of approaches to mitigating hallucination in LLMs, while also identifying their limitations and laying out pathways for advancing research in this critical area. The taxonomy, synthesis, and analysis of limitations collectively further the knowledge in computational linguistics regarding the pressing issue of hallucinations in large language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper categorizes the hallucination mitigation techniques into prompt engineering and model development. Within prompt engineering, how does retrieval augmented generation differ from self-refinement through feedback and reasoning in tackling hallucinations? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages?

2. The taxonomy highlights supervised fine-tuning as an important model development technique. What are some key considerations and challenges in creating datasets and loss functions to ensure factual finetuning that reduces hallucinations?

3. Retrieval augmented generation seems to be an effective prompt engineering technique. How can we develop more robust ranking and selection mechanisms during the retrieval process to maximize factual correctness in the retrieved evidence? 

4. The paper discusses limitations in some supervised fine-tuning methods regarding smaller model sizes. What innovations in knowledge distillation can help address hallucinations for large models fine-tuned to smaller sizes?

5. What kind of prompts and question formats are most effective for the self-refinement techniques to ensure the model can accurately self-evaluate and reduce its own hallucinations? How can we programmatically generate such prompts?

6. How can the structured comparative reasoning technique be extended beyond summarization, retrieval and rating to other complex language generation tasks that require logical consistency? What metrics can evaluate the comparisons?

7. For techniques using knowledge graphs, what graph mining approaches can help identify factual relationships and qualitative, higher-order links between entities and predicates to mitigate reasoning hallucinations? 

8. How can loss functions balance between factual correctness and language quality to avoid deteriorations in fluency and coherence when targeting hallucination reductions during fine-tuning?

9. The paper focuses on English language models. What cross-lingual techniques show promise in scaling hallucination mitigation across languages with limited labeled data?

10. What hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques like retrieval augmented generation, feedback loops and factual fine-tuning in an end-to-end framework can provide generalized solutions against hallucinations across domains?
