# Toward Grounded Social Reasoning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can robots perform grounded social reasoning to act in a socially appropriate manner in real-world environments, when they lack full information about the state of objects in the scene?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Large language models (LLMs) have the capacity for social reasoning, but they need to be grounded in perception of the real environment.2) Passively querying vision-language models (VLMs) is often insufficient, as real-world scenes may be cluttered or occluded.3) Robots can actively gather missing information by asking clarifying questions about the scene and obtaining new viewpoints/images of objects through embodied perception. 4) This active information gathering will significantly improve the grounded social reasoning capabilities of robots equipped with LLMs and VLMs, allowing them to make better socially appropriate decisions about manipulating real-world objects and scenes.The central goal seems to be developing and evaluating a framework that enables robots to actively perceive the environment in order to gather the information needed to make socially appropriate decisions, as humans are able to do through commonsense reasoning. The key insight is that both active questioning and active perception are needed to obtain the necessary contextual details.
