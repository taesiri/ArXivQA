# [Toward Grounded Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08651)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can robots perform grounded social reasoning to act in a socially appropriate manner in real-world environments, when they lack full information about the state of objects in the scene?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Large language models (LLMs) have the capacity for social reasoning, but they need to be grounded in perception of the real environment.

2) Passively querying vision-language models (VLMs) is often insufficient, as real-world scenes may be cluttered or occluded.

3) Robots can actively gather missing information by asking clarifying questions about the scene and obtaining new viewpoints/images of objects through embodied perception. 

4) This active information gathering will significantly improve the grounded social reasoning capabilities of robots equipped with LLMs and VLMs, allowing them to make better socially appropriate decisions about manipulating real-world objects and scenes.

The central goal seems to be developing and evaluating a framework that enables robots to actively perceive the environment in order to gather the information needed to make socially appropriate decisions, as humans are able to do through commonsense reasoning. The key insight is that both active questioning and active perception are needed to obtain the necessary contextual details.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a framework to enable robots to perform "grounded social reasoning" by combining large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The key insight is that robots need to actively gather information from the environment in order to make socially appropriate decisions, rather than just passively querying the LLM and VLM models.

2. Releasing a new dataset called MessySurfaces that contains images of 70 real-world surfaces/desks that need to be cleaned. The dataset has over 300 objects annotated with multiple choice questions about the appropriate way to clean each object. This serves as a benchmark for evaluating grounded social reasoning.

3. Demonstrating their approach on the MessySurfaces benchmark dataset as well as with robot experiments on real surfaces. They show improvements over baselines that do not employ active perception.

4. Analyzing the different components of their framework - generating good follow up questions, choosing informative close-up angles, answering questions using the VLM. This provides an in-depth evaluation.

5. Showing preliminary experiments that incorporating personal preferences on top of their framework can further improve performance.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a method that combines LLMs and VLMs in a novel way to enable robots to actively gather information and perform grounded social reasoning, with minimal human intervention. The release of the MessySurfaces dataset also provides a way to benchmark progress in this area.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing an approach to enable robots to perform grounded social reasoning by combining large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The idea of leveraging LLMs and VLMs for robotic tasks is gaining increasing interest, but most prior work has focused on using these models in a passive way rather than enabling active perception and information gathering. 

- In terms of using LLMs for social reasoning, this paper builds on previous work showing LLMs can be effective for commonsense reasoning and making moral judgements. However, this prior work did not study grounded reasoning in robotic environments. The idea of grounding LLM reasoning is novel.

- For active perception, this paper cites some related work in embodied AI and navigation settings. However, active perception specifically for social reasoning intidying tasks appears to be a new contribution. The framework of using an LLM to guide the active perception process seems unique.

- The release of the MessySurfaces dataset for benchmarking is a valuable contribution that enables standardized evaluation of grounded social reasoning approaches. This adds a new dimension beyond existing vision-and-language dataset styles.

- Compared to learning from human feedback or demonstrations, this paper presents an alternative paradigm - leveraging the implicit knowledge in LLMs to reduce hand engineering and human involvement. But it doesn't aim to fully solve personalization.

- Overall, this paper pushes forward grounded social reasoning for robotics in new ways by combining LLMs and VLMs. The active perception framework guided by an LLM is a novel concept not explored by other works. Releasing the MessySurfaces benchmark is also an impactful contribution for the field.

In summary, this paper presents a unique approach and contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in applying large language models to robotics for social intelligence. The active perception component and the new benchmark seem to be the biggest areas of novelty compared to prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing learned approaches for guiding active perception based on uncertainty, rather than relying on heuristic approaches like predefined angles. This could involve things like learned view planning or using neural radiance fields.

- Enabling the robot to dynamically interact with objects while gathering information, rather than just taking static images. For example, allowing the robot to open boxes, remove clutter, etc. to better understand objects and determine appropriate actions.

- Enabling the robot to ask for human preferences or other identifying information when it is unclear about the appropriate action to take. This would allow the system to start with commonsense social reasoning, but personalize behavior when needed.

- Evaluating the approach on a more diverse set of environments and objects beyond just messy desks. This includes expanding the types of social reasoning needed.

- Exploring other modalities beyond just vision that could help the robot gather useful information, like audio or haptic sensing. 

- Studying when and how much active information gathering is beneficial compared to just using passive perception. Identifying the right balance could improve efficiency.

- Integrating the approach with more sophisticated manipulation skills and perception modules to enable fully closed-loop execution.

- Exploring how the approach could generalize to other embodied AI tasks beyond tidying and cleaning, such as navigation or mobile manipulation.

In summary, the key directions are around scaling up the environments and skills, improving the active perception, adding personalization, and empirically studying the trade-offs around active vs. passive perception. The authors lay out an exciting research agenda toward more competent embodied agents.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach for enabling robots to perform grounded social reasoning in order to clean up real-world surfaces in a socially appropriate manner. The key ideas are:

- Large language models (LLMs) have common sense knowledge that can enable social reasoning, but tapping into this knowledge requires grounding the reasoning in the physical world. This is difficult because static images may not contain enough information. 

- The authors propose an iterative framework that leverages an LLM and a vision-language model (VLM). The LLM asks clarifying questions about details needed to make socially appropriate decisions. A robot then takes informative close-up images of objects to help the VLM answer the questions and provide missing details.

- They introduce the MessySurfaces dataset containing images of 70 real-world surfaces and 308 objects that need to be cleaned up. Each object has benchmark questions about the appropriate way to tidy it. 

- Experiments show their method outperforms baselines without active perception by 12.9% on average on the benchmark. On a real robot tidying up complex surfaces, their approach beats baselines by 15% on average. This demonstrates the value of active perception for grounded social reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to enable a robot to perform grounded social reasoning by actively gathering information from the environment. The key insight is that robots need to go beyond passively querying language models and vision-language models. Instead, they must reason about what additional information is needed to make socially appropriate decisions, and then actively perceive the environment to gather that information. 

The proposed framework combines a large language model (LLM) and a vision-language model (VLM). The LLM generates follow-up questions about objects in a scene to identify missing information. The robot then takes close-up images of the objects from angles suggested by the LLM. The images and questions are fed to the VLM to provide more descriptive information about the scene. This process repeats to iteratively gather more information. Finally, the LLM chooses socially appropriate actions for the robot to tidy objects. The framework is evaluated on a new dataset of real-world cluttered surfaces and through robotic experiments. Results demonstrate improvements in social reasoning compared to passive approaches, highlighting the importance of active perception.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework that enables robots to perform grounded social reasoning by iteratively gathering additional information about a scene through active perception. The framework takes an image of a messy scene and an instruction as input. It first uses a vision-language model (VLM) to generate an initial description of visible objects. Then, a large language model (LLM) asks follow-up questions about missing details needed to determine appropriate actions on each object. To gather this missing information, a robot takes close-up images of each object from angles suggested by the LLM. The LLM-generated questions and robot images are fed back into the VLM to answer the questions and append details to the scene description. This iterative process of the LLM asking follow-up questions, a robot actively perceiving via suggested angles, and the VLM answering questions, allows the framework to incrementally build an understanding grounded in the physical scene. Finally, the framework uses the LLM to select socially appropriate tidying actions for each object based on the accrued contextual information. Experiments show improvements over passive approaches by actively gathering information with the robot.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the challenge of enabling robots to make socially appropriate decisions in real-world environments. Specifically, it focuses on the task of cleaning up cluttered surfaces in a way that aligns with human preferences and values.

The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Most prior work has focused on learning rewards or imitation policies to capture human preferences. However, specifying preferences a priori for all possible scenarios a robot may encounter is very difficult. 

- Instead, the authors propose leveraging the commonsense reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to make socially appropriate decisions, without needing explicit human specification.

- However, simply querying an LLM is not enough for grounded, real-world robotics. The paper argues robots need to actively gather visual information from the environment to provide the necessary context to the LLM.

- They introduce a framework that combines an LLM and vision-language model (VLM) to iteratively ask clarifying questions about a scene, take informative images to answer those questions, and then make appropriate decisions.

- The framework is evaluated on a new dataset called MessySurfaces, containing images of real cluttered surfaces and benchmark questions about cleaning the surfaces. Experiments show benefits of active perception over passive approaches.

- The system is also validated on a physical robot, where the LLM can generate goals and actions that are executed by the robot to tidy up scenes.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be enabling more sophisticated social reasoning for robots by grounding LLM knowledge through active perception, with less need for explicit human specification or preference learning. The combination of an LLM and VLM to gather visual context is a novel approach.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a framework to enable robots to perform grounded social reasoning in real-world environments. The key idea is that robots must go beyond passively querying language models (LLMs) and instead actively gather missing information from the environment that is required to make socially appropriate decisions. The framework iteratively identifies details the robot still needs to clarify about a scene by asking follow-up questions using an LLM, then actively gathering new observations (e.g. close-up images) of objects to help answer those questions, before finally deciding on socially appropriate actions. For evaluation, the authors introduce the MessySurfaces dataset containing images of real-world cluttered surfaces needing to be cleaned up. Experiments on this dataset and a real robot system demonstrate improvements in socially appropriate cleaning decisions over baselines, highlighting the benefits of active perception guided by an LLM's reasoning. The work provides a promising approach to inject robots with more awareness of social norms and common sense without needing explicit human input. Key limitations around relying on perceptual heuristics and lack of personalization are also discussed.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework to enable robots to perform grounded social reasoning by iteratively identifying missing details about a scene that are needed to make appropriate decisions, and actively gathering new observations to fill those gaps. The key idea is that rather than just passively querying large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs), the robot should reason about what additional visual information it requires and then actively perceive the environment to gather that information, for instance by taking close-up images of objects from suggested angles. The approach combines an LLM, VLM, and robot system, where the LLM proposes follow-up questions about unclear aspects of a scene, suggests angles for taking informative images of objects, and finally decides on socially appropriate actions. The approach is evaluated on a new real-world image dataset of messy scenes needing to be cleaned up, as well as on a physical robot tidying real surfaces. Results demonstrate benefits over non-active approaches, taking steps toward enabling robots to perform grounded social reasoning without needing explicit human supervision or preferences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative framework that combines an LLM and VLM for grounded social reasoning. What are the key benefits and downsides of this iterative approach compared to a single-step approach? How could the framework be improved to reduce the number of iterations required?

2. The LLM plays several distinct roles in the framework - generating follow-up questions, choosing perceptual actions/angles, and selecting action plans. What is the rationale behind using the same LLM for these diverse reasoning tasks? Would it be better to have separate specialized models?
