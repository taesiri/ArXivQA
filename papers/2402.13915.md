# [A Combined Learning and Optimization Framework to Transfer Human   Whole-body Loco-manipulation Skills to Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13915)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Humans have the remarkable ability to smoothly coordinate locomotion and manipulation motions to perform complex whole-body tasks. However, transferring such coordinated skills to mobile manipulators (MMs) is challenging due to:
1) The difficulty in planning and controlling locomotion and manipulation simultaneously in a coordinated fashion. Most approaches treat them as separate subsystems.
2) The inability of most methods to handle dynamic manipulation tasks that require grasping objects while the base/arm is still moving (non-zero end-effector velocity).
3) The difficulty in transferring skills from humans to robots with very different geometries.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a combined learning and optimization framework to transfer human whole-body loco-manipulation skills to mobile manipulators. The key components are:

1) Whole-body trajectory learning from human demonstrations: The wrist and pelvis trajectories are treated as whole-body trajectories and mapped to the MM's end-effector (EE) and base. Kernelized Movement Primitives (KMP) is used to learn and generalize the trajectories to new task settings.

2) Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) controller: Defines EE trajectory tracking as the primary task and base pose tracking as secondary. It generates optimal joint-level commands while satisfying feasibility constraints. This enables coordinated EE and base motion.  

Main Contributions:
1) Learns coordinated whole-body loco-manipulation trajectories from humans and generalizes them to new targets.

2) Transfers skills to MM with different geometry through prioritization in HQP controller.

3) Achieves dynamic manipulation at non-zero EE velocities, enabled by learned human velocity profiles.

4) No need to manually define or switch between locomotion/manipulation modes. HQP controller generates smooth transitions.

The approach is validated on a mobile manipulator through pick-and-place experiments, demonstrating successful skill transfer and non-zero velocity grasping, even when generalized to new settings.
