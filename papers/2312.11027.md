# [Learning Top-k Subtask Planning Tree based on Discriminative   Representation Pre-training for Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11027)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many real-world tasks can be decomposed into smaller, more manageable subtasks. Planning and utilizing knowledge extracted from these subtasks is crucial for AI agents to make accurate decisions when facing complex tasks. However, existing methods have two key limitations: (1) They lack the ability to extract discriminative and robust knowledge representations from subtask data. (2) They cannot effectively utilize the learned knowledge to plan the execution of subtasks to solve more complex composite tasks.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces a framework with two key components to address the limitations:

1. Discriminative Subtask Representation Learning: A multi-encoder architecture is used where each encoder learns representations for one subtask. This prevents interference across different subtasks. A shared predictor is also used to predict rewards and state transitions. This forces the encoders to capture the essential dynamics of each subtask. Contrastive learning ensures distinctiveness of representations across subtasks.

2. Top-k Subtask Planning Tree: An attention module is used to construct a tree comprising the top-k most relevant subtasks to solve the given complex task. The tree plans the sequence and combinations of subtasks that need to be executed. A discounted UCB method is used to find the optimal path through the tree to guide the agent's actions.

Main Contributions:

- A novel method to learn distinguishable and informative knowledge representations from subtask data using multiple encoders and an auxiliary prediction task.

- An algorithm to automatically construct a top-k subtask planning tree to plan the execution of subtasks for solving complex tasks.

- Demonstrated superior performance over competitive baselines on complex navigation tasks in BabyAI that require long-horizon planning and compositional understanding.

The key advantage is the ability to extract useful knowledge representations from simple subtasks and leverage that knowledge to effectively plan solutions for more complex tasks. This improves sample efficiency and performance on composite tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to learn distinguishable subtask representations from priors, construct a top-k subtask planning tree to customize execution plans, and use it to guide policy learning to solve complicated reinforcement learning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a multiple-encoder and individual-predictor learning regime to learn distinguishable subtask representations with task-essential properties.

2. Proposing to construct a top-k subtask planning tree to customize subtask execution plans for learning with subtask-conditioned reinforcement learning. 

3. Empirical evaluations on several challenging navigation tasks that show the proposed method can achieve superior performance over competitive baselines. The results are consistent with intuitive expectations and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.

In summary, the key ideas are using multiple encoders to learn better subtask representations, generating a top-k planning tree to guide the policy learning, and showing improved performance on complex navigation tasks. The main contribution is a novel method for learning from subtask priors and planning for solving more complicated tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Subtask-conditioned reinforcement learning (ScRL): Using priors/subtasks to guide reinforcement learning on more complex tasks.

- Subtask representations: Learning compact embeddings that capture important properties of subtasks using multiple encoders and a shared predictor. Uses contrastive learning and model-based prediction.

- Top-k subtask planning tree: Generating a tree to represent plans for sequencing and selecting subtasks. Uses attention and discounted UCB for planning.

- Policy learning: Learning a policy conditioned on states and subtask embeddings/plans from the tree to solve tasks. Uses PPO-style updates.

- Evaluation in BabyAI: Testing the approach on compositional, sequential tasks in the BabyAI benchmark that require chaining multiple subskills.

The main ideas are using representation learning to get useful priors on subtasks, leveraging those representations to do hierarchical planning with a top-k tree, and then using the plan from the tree to guide policy learning on complex tasks. The evaluation aims to show benefits in learning efficiency and performance on problems requiring compositional use of skills.
