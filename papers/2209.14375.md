# [Improving alignment of dialogue agents via targeted human judgements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14375)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: How can targeted human judgements be used to improve the alignment of dialogue agents via reinforcement learning from human feedback?More specifically, the central hypotheses seem to be:1) Breaking down requirements for good dialogue behavior into specific natural language rules will allow for more targeted human judgements of agent behavior. This can enable more efficient training of rule-conditional reward models. 2) Having the agent provide supporting evidence alongside its statements will improve the correctness and verifiability of its responses. 3) Combining targeted rule judgements and overall response preferences with reinforcement learning can yield a dialogue agent that is preferred to baselines while also being more resilient to adversarial human probing.So in summary, the central research questions revolve around using targeted human feedback and inline evidence to improve the alignment of dialogue agents via multi-objective reinforcement learning. The key hypotheses are that breaking down rules, providing evidence, and combining preferences with rules in RL can yield improved alignment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be developing a dialogue agent called Sparrow that is trained via reinforcement learning from human feedback to be more helpful, correct, and harmless compared to baseline language models. Some key aspects are:- Using targeted human judgements on specific rules (e.g. do not threaten, do not give medical advice) to get more fine-grained feedback and train rule-based classifiers. This allows more efficient training compared to just using a generic "safe/unsafe" label.- Incorporating evidence from web searches to make factual claims verifiable and improve correctness. When providing evidence, Sparrow's responses are found to be supported 78% of the time.- Training via a multi-objective RL scheme that optimizes for human preferences (helpfulness) while minimizing rule violations (harmlessness). This results in improved preference rates while reducing rule violations compared to baselines.- Detailed analysis of the impact of the training methods on distributional fairness issues like stereotyping, finding that instance-level rules do not fully resolve these.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be developing a dialogue agent that can engage in information-seeking conversations, while being optimized for helpfulness, correctness, and safety through targeted human judgements and web evidence. The analysis also highlights both the successes and limitations of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes using targeted human judgements of model behavior against specific rules, along with evidence to support factual claims, to train a dialogue agent via reinforcement learning that is more helpful, harmless, and correct compared to baseline prompted models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other research in the field of alignment for dialogue agents:- This paper focuses specifically on using human feedback and reinforcement learning to improve an information-seeking dialogue agent. Other related work like BlenderBot 3 and LaMDA uses more supervised learning or ranking approaches. - The paper introduces targeted human judgements on specific rules (e.g. do not threaten, do not give medical advice). This is more fine-grained than prior work that looks at overall safety/harm labels or broad notions of harm.- The paper trains reward models for human preferences and rule compliance, combining them for multi-objective RL. Other related work like Anthropic's assistant uses a unified reward model for all human feedback.- For improving correctness, this paper adapts the inline evidence approach from GopherCite to dialogue. Providing evidence to raters helps verify factual claims. Other dialogue agents retrieve information but don't show evidence to raters.- For analyzing distributional harms, this paper looks at both stereotyping and disparate performance on QA datasets. The analysis goes beyond prior work by showing RL can amplify certain biases.- The paper proposes using dialogue itself to assist with accurate human supervision in the future. Other related alignment work has not emphasized dialogue specifically as a mechanism for robust and scalable supervision.In summary, key novelties are the targeted rules, use of evidence for dialogue, multi-objective RL approach, and analysis showing potential downsides of RL for distributional issues. The idea of using dialogue for supervision is underexplored. Overall, this paper pushes forward robust human-AI interaction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more targeted human judgments to better characterize and mitigate model failures. The authors used natural language rules that raters judged, but suggest this could be expanded with methods like debate.- Using dialogue as a mechanism for supervision. The authors propose that dialogue allows iterative discussion to resolve subtle cases of evaluating agent behavior.- Expanding the set of rules to cover more topics. The rules in this paper were limited in scope, so expanding to more rules through expert and participatory engagement is needed.- Studying the cognitive science of human-AI interaction. The authors emphasize understanding how evidence impacts human beliefs and developing modes of evidence less susceptible to bias is important. - Architectures to scale rules. The rule-conditional classifiers worked for a limited rule set, but new techniques are likely needed to handle thousands of rules.- Understanding the sociotechnical aspects of rules. This includes studying the participatory development of rules, their interpretability, and how control over rules impacts outcomes.- Mitigating distributional harms. The rules used mainly address instance harms detectable by raters. New techniques are needed to address aggregated effects like bias.- Developing open-ended training over an expanding range of topics and trade-offs.In summary, the authors propose many promising research avenues to improve the technique of targeted human judgments presented in this paper and apply it to even more capable and robust dialogue agents.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents Sparrow, a dialogue agent trained via reinforcement learning from human feedback to be helpful, correct, and harmless compared to language model baselines. The authors introduce two key innovations: breaking down requirements into specific natural language rules that human raters can judge, and having the agent provide evidence from web searches to support its factual claims. These allow more targeted feedback from human raters. Sparrow is shown to be preferred over baselines in simulations, while also being more resilient to adversarial attacks by humans trying to elicit harmful responses. The inline evidence results in the agent's factual claims being supported 78% of the time. However, the authors conduct extensive analyses showing their methods can amplify distributional fairness issues, highlighting the need for further work. Overall, the results demonstrate promising techniques for training aligned dialogue agents using human feedback.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method for improving the alignment of dialogue agents through targeted human judgements. The authors introduce two key innovations. First, they define a set of natural language rules that the agent should follow related to being helpful, correct, and harmless. They collect human judgements on whether the agent violates each specific rule, rather than just a general notion of alignment. Second, when collecting human preferences between model responses, the agent provides evidence from sources that support its factual claims. The authors demonstrate these methods on an information-seeking dialogue agent called Sparrow. The targeted rules and human judgements enable more efficient training of a rule violation classifier. Providing evidence leads to raters finding Sparrow's factual claims supported 78% of the time. Sparrow is preferred by raters over baselines while also being more resilient to adversarial human probing - violating rules just 8% of the time compared to 14-22% for baselines. Detailed analysis reveals Sparrow exhibits social biases, indicating that while these methods mitigate specific instance harms, more work is needed to address distributional harms. Overall, the paper introduces effective techniques for steering dialogue agents towards preferable behavior.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents Sparrow, a dialogue agent trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback to be more helpful, correct, and harmless compared to baseline prompted language models. The authors introduce two key techniques: breaking down requirements for good dialogue into detailed natural language rules that human raters evaluate (e.g. "Do not make threatening statements"), and having the agent provide inline evidence from web searches to support its factual claims. These allow more targeted feedback. The agent is trained using a combination of human preference judgements between model responses, and rule violation classifications. The resulting multi-objective reinforcement learning policy outperforms baselines in being preferred by users while also being more resilient to adversarial human probing. Sparrow provides plausible evidence 78% of the time, and humans only find it violating rules 8% of the time under adversarial conditions. The authors conduct detailed bias analyses, finding issues remain despite gains on specific rules.
