# [NÜWA: Visual Synthesis Pre-training for Neural visUal World creAtion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12417)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a unified multimodal pre-trained model that supports various visual synthesis tasks for both images and videos?

The key hypotheses are:

- A general 3D transformer encoder-decoder framework can cover language, image, and video modalities to support different visual synthesis scenarios.

- A 3D Nearby Attention (3DNA) mechanism can effectively model the locality characteristic in both spatial and temporal dimensions for visual data while reducing computational complexity. 

- Pre-training the model with multi-task learning on text-to-image, text-to-video, and video prediction will allow it to achieve strong performance on downstream visual synthesis tasks.

So in summary, the central research question is how to build an effective unified model for visual synthesis tasks, and the key hypotheses are around using a 3D transformer framework with 3DNA and multi-task pre-training to achieve this. The experiments then aim to validate whether this proposed NÜWA model can outperform other approaches on various downstream visual generation and manipulation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes NÜWA, a unified multimodal pre-trained model that covers text, image, and video modalities. NÜWA uses a general 3D transformer encoder-decoder framework which can handle different modalities and generate/manipulate visual data.

2. It proposes a 3D Nearby Attention (3DNA) mechanism that considers the locality characteristic in both spatial and temporal dimensions. 3DNA reduces computational complexity and improves visual quality. 

3. It evaluates NÜWA on 8 downstream visual synthesis tasks including text-to-image, text-to-video, video prediction, etc. NÜWA achieves state-of-the-art results on these tasks. It also shows good zero-shot capabilities on text-guided image and video manipulation.

4. The unified framework and multi-task pretraining with images and videos allow NÜWA to achieve strong performance on both image and video generation/manipulation tasks. This is a step towards building an AI platform for visual world creation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a unified multimodal pre-trained model NÜWA for visual synthesis, which uses a novel 3D framework and attention mechanism. NÜWA outperforms previous models on multiple image and video generation/manipulation tasks.
