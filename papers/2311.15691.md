# [Automated discovery of trade-off between utility, privacy and fairness   in machine learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15691)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes PFairDP, an automated pipeline for training machine learning models that achieve optimal trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and utility. The authors formulate the problem as multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently discover Pareto-optimal configurations balancing the three conflicting objectives. PFairDP incorporates modular pre-processing techniques like disparate impact remover and post-processing like reject option classification for enforcing fairness, leverages differential privacy mechanisms like gradient clipping and noise injection for privacy, and tunes hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate to maximize utility. Experiments demonstrate PFairDP replicating results from prior work with less variance and outperforming baselines in approximating Pareto fronts on two datasets. The modular framework allows flexibility in model choice and bias mitigation method. Key advantage is automatically finding optimal configurations rather than relying on manual tuning of constraints. Overall, PFairDP enables practitioners to make informed data-driven decisions when balancing critical ethical and legal considerations around fairness, privacy and performance of machine learning systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PFairDP, a pipeline for automatically discovering Pareto-optimal trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and utility in machine learning models using multi-objective Bayesian optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of PFairDP, which is a pipeline for automatically quantifying and optimizing the trade-off between differential privacy, fairness, and performance (utility) of machine learning models. Specifically:

- PFairDP interprets the three-way trade-off between privacy, fairness, and utility as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to find the Pareto-optimal configurations that best balance the three objectives. 

- It implements a modular pipeline with separate modules for enforcing fairness, differential privacy, and model training. The parameters in each module affect at least one of the three objectives.

- It uses multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the configuration space and approximate the 3D Pareto front between fairness, privacy, and utility. This automation allows it to explore a wider range of configurations compared to manually setting constraints.

- Experiments show PFairDP can replicate results from prior constraint-based methods, as well as discover new Pareto-optimal points on several models and datasets. This demonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and demonstration of an automated pipeline for discovering the trade-off between utility, privacy, and fairness in ML models, framed as a multi-objective optimization problem. The key innovation is using Bayesian optimization for efficient Pareto front estimation.
