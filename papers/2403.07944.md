## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality and temporally consistent videos from text and image inputs remains a challenging task in artificial intelligence. Issues like maintaining coherence across frames, ensuring smooth motions, and aligning output videos to input text/images need to be addressed.

Proposed Solution - WorldGPT Framework
- Uses a two-stage process - prompt enhancement and full video translation
- Prompt Enhancer: Employs ChatGPT to refine text prompts for better context and accuracy. Generates keywords, input frame state and optimization prompts.
- Key Frame Generator: Uses object detection on input image to create target masks. Then leverages stable diffusion, guided by the distilled prompts from ChatGPT, to create the final video frame. 
- Video Generator: Connects start and end frames using DynamiCrafter. Further refines frames by incorporating background details from ChatGPT prompts to enhance quality.

Main Contributions:
- Integrates leading language models like ChatGPT and vision models like Stable Diffusion in an innovative way to achieve strong alignment between input text, images and final generated video.
- Significantly enhances control over the video generation process through detailed prompt programming. 
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DynamiCrafter across metrics like text-video alignment, motion quality, temporal consistency while achieving comparable visual quality.
- Qualitative evaluations also showcase the exceptional prompt-based control over video generation using this method.

In summary, WorldGPT pushes boundaries in controllable video generation from textual and visual inputs by harnessing a wide array of AI models in a creative framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an innovative video generation AI agent called WorldGPT that harnesses multimodal learning to build skilled world models from text and image inputs, with a focus on enhancing temporal consistency and action smoothness in the generated video sequences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an innovative video generation AI agent called "WorldGPT" that harnesses the power of Sora-inspired multimodal learning to build skilled world models from textual prompts and accompanying images. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a framework that includes a "Prompt Enhancer" based on ChatGPT to distill precise prompts for subsequent steps, ensuring accuracy in communication and execution. 

2) Presenting a "Key Frame Generator" that uses state-of-the-art models like GroundingDINO and Stable Diffusion guided by the enhanced prompts from ChatGPT to create key video frames.

3) Employing the DynamiCrafter technique to generate seamless video sequences between the starting image and ending key frame.

4) Showing both quantitatively and qualitatively that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in metrics like text-video alignment, motion quality, and temporal consistency.

In summary, the main novelty is in the integration of multiple leading-edge AI models to achieve impressive and controllable video generation from textual and visual inputs in a zero-shot setting.
