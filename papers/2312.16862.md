# [TinyGPT-V: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model via Small Backbones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16862)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V demonstrate impressive visual-language capabilities but have issues around lack of open-source access, high computational demand, and difficulty modifying them.  
- Open-source MLLMs like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 have shown strong performance but still require substantial resources for training and inference. There is a need for more efficient yet high-quality MLLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces TinyGPT-V, a new cost-effective and high-performing MLLM requiring only a 24G GPU for training and 8G GPU/CPU for inference.
- TinyGPT-V uses an advanced 2.7B parameter language model Phi-2 as its backbone, which matches larger models. For vision, it utilizes BLIP-2/CLIP's pre-trained modules.
- Unique normalization techniques like RMS Norm and Query-Key Norm are added to Phi-2 to improve stability for multimodal transfer learning.
- A 4-stage training process is used spanning image-text pretraining, human-like instruction tuning, and multi-task conversational tuning.

Main Contributions:
- TinyGPT-V reaches high performance on par with or exceeding 13B parameter MLLMs on visual QA tasks, using only 2.8B parameters. It has state-of-the-art efficiency.
- Ablation studies demonstrate TinyGPT-V's modules like LoRA and QK Norm prevent gradients vanishing and maintain low loss. 
- The work represents significant progress towards reaching equilibrium between performance and efficiency for practical MLLMs.
- TinyGPT-V advances possibilities for deploying capable MLLMs affordably in diverse real-world applications.

In summary, TinyGPT-V introduces an efficient yet powerful MLLM architecture using compact techniques like Phi-2 and normalization to enable high visual-language skills in a practical and accessible package.
