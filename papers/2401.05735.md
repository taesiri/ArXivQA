# [Object-Centric Diffusion for Efficient Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Object-Centric Diffusion for Efficient Video Editing":

Problem: 
Recent diffusion-based models can transform the style, structure, and attributes of video inputs following textual prompts. However, they incur heavy computational and memory costs to generate temporally-coherent frames. This is due to reliance on techniques like diffusion inversion and cross-frame attention. The paper analyzes these costs and identifies key bottlenecks: memory overhead from storing attention maps, excessive cross-frame attention, and high number of sampling steps.

Proposed Solution - Object-Centric Diffusion (OCD):
The authors propose exploiting the object-centric nature of video editing tasks, where edits often focus on foreground objects. They introduce two techniques:

1) Object-Centric Sampling: Separate diffusion process between foreground objects and background. Most sampling steps focus on foreground to improve efficiency. Background uses fewer steps. Blend representations at a later stage for consistency.

2) Object-Centric 3D Token Merging: Merge redundant tokens from background regions using 3D volumes across space and time. Preserve more tokens on foreground objects. Exploits temporal redundancy in videos.

These optimize sampling and attention costs towards more important foreground regions. Applicable to any model without retraining.

Contributions:
- Analyze bottlenecks in video editing models 
- Suggest off-the-shelf optimizations for faster sampling and token merging
- Propose object-centric techniques to focus computations on important regions
- Achieve up to 10x faster editing without quality loss
- Demonstrate gains by optimizing inversion and ControlNet-based models

Overall, the paper introduces effective ways to speed up video editing models by exploiting their object-centric nature, reducing both memory and computational requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces object-centric diffusion, a set of techniques to accelerate video editing diffusion models by focusing computations on foreground edited regions and reducing redundant tokens, achieving up to 10x speedup without compromising quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It analyzes the computational bottlenecks and inefficiencies in recent diffusion-based video editing methods, identifying key sources of high memory usage and latency such as inversion-based guidance and cross-frame attention.

2) It shows that off-the-shelf optimizations like faster samplers and token merging can significantly speed up video editing pipelines without compromising quality.

3) It introduces two new techniques tailored for video editing: 

- Object-Centric Sampling, which separates the diffusion process between foreground edited objects and background regions to focus model capacity on the former.  

- Object-Centric 3D Token Merging, which reduces the number of cross-frame attention tokens by preferentially fusing redundant ones in background areas.

4) Combined under the name Object-Centric Diffusion (OCD), the paper shows these solutions can seamlessly optimize existing video editing models, speeding them up considerably (e.g. 10x for inversion-based and 6x for ControlNet-based) without retraining or sacrificing quality.

So in summary, the main contribution is a set of efficient techniques to significantly accelerate diffusion-based video editing pipelines in a zero-shot manner, by exploiting the object-centric nature of typical editing tasks.
