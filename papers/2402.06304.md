# [A New Approach to Voice Authenticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06304)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The common binary classification of audio as either "fake" (e.g. synthesized speech) or "real" is an oversimplification that fails to address the complexity of assessing voice authenticity.  
- A range of voice edits, like changing playback speed or equalization, can be used to spread misinformation even with real human speech. Detecting these edits is critical but overlooked.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a taxonomy of 21 fine-grained voice edit types spanning 6 categories: source origin, temporal edits, modulation/effects, encodings, frequency edits, and spatial/environmental edits.
- A dataset framework is introduced to generate examples of these edits by modifying utterances from the M-AILABS speech corpus using both traditional audio processing techniques and neural TTS/voice conversion.  
- Four neural network models (LCNN, ComplexNet, RawNet2, SSL W2V2) from voice anti-spoofing literature are evaluated for detecting the edit types.

Key Contributions:
- Argument for a paradigm shift away from simplistic "real vs fake" detection to more comprehensive identification of fine-grained voice edits.
- Taxonomy covering 21 types of voice edits across 6 categories.
- Dataset framework dynamically creating examples of edits by transforming M-AILABS utterances.
- Analysis of detection accuracy on edit types using common neural architectures from anti-spoofing works. 
- Discussion of real-world use cases for voice edit detection like fighting disinformation, legal authenticity, biometric security, etc.

The paper makes an important case that merely labeling audio as synthetic/fake vs genuine overlooks many ways real speech can be edited for misuse. A more nuanced detection approach is needed spanning traditional and neural modifications.
