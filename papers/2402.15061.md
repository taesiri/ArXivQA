# [Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Domain-specific Machine   Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15061)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for machine translation (MT) when prompted with instructions. However, their potential for domain-specific MT is under-explored. 
- Existing methods that use in-context learning or fine-tuning have limitations such as sensitivity to example quality, over-generation, high computational cost, over-specialization, and struggling with rare words.

Proposed Solution:
- A prompt-oriented fine-tuning method called LlamaIT to adapt LLMs for domain-specific MT.
- Fine-tune Llama2-7B on a mix-domain dataset of translation instruction-task pairs, using LoRA for efficient training.
- Construct prompts by incorporating domain vocabularies into source sentences. 
- At inference, adapt to target domain via prompting instructions without needing examples.

Main Contributions:
- Eliminates need for post-processing or over-specialization by fine-tuning on mix-domain data described by instructions.
- Enhances translation capability for rare words using domain vocabulary prompting.  
- Repairs general-purpose MT capability lost during fine-tuning by using mix-domain data.
- Achieves inference efficiency by eliminating input examples.
- Experiments show LlamaIT significantly improves domain-specific MT over base Llama2-7B in both directions while preserving general MT capability.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient prompt-based fine-tuning approach to enhance LLMs for domain-specific machine translation without losing their general translation capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a prompt-oriented fine-tuning method called LlamaIT to effectively and efficiently adapt large language models for domain-specific machine translation by combining fine-tuning and prompting strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a prompt-oriented fine-tuning method (LlamaIT) to effectively and efficiently fine-tune a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for domain-specific machine translation (MT) tasks. This eliminates the need for providing in-context examples during inference or post-processing the outputs.

2. Performing the prompt-oriented fine-tuning with LoRA on the Llama2-7B model. This reduces the number of trainable parameters and training costs compared to full fine-tuning. 

3. Constructing translation prompts by incorporating domain-specific bilingual vocabulary into the input source sentences. This improves the LLM's MT capability for rare words. 

4. Conducting extensive experiments that demonstrate LlamaIT can significantly enhance the domain-specific MT capabilities of the LLM, while preserving its general-purpose zero-shot MT capabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient prompt-oriented fine-tuning approach to adapt LLMs for improved domain-specific machine translation, especially on rare words.
