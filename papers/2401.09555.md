# [Improving Classification Performance With Human Feedback: Label a few,   we label the rest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09555)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Obtaining labeled data to train supervised ML models is challenging since 85% of data is unstructured. 
- Traditional methods rely on manually labeling millions of examples which is tedious, time-consuming and costly.
- Manual labeling can also have errors which then propagate through the dataset.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use few-shot learning and active learning to improve models with human feedback on just a few labeled examples. 
- Apply this to large language models like GPT-3.5, BERT and SetFit.
- Use a feedback loop where models make predictions, humans correct some errors, models are retrained on this data.

Main Contributions:
- Show that with as few as 10-150 labeled examples, can surpass zero-shot model accuracy on text classification.
- Test on diverse datasets - Amazon reviews, financial phrases, banking, Craigslist, TREC.
- Accuracy, precision and recall improve steadily with more labels.
- Targeted training on areas the model is weak improves proficiency.
- Approach is promising for reducing manual labeling costs while maintaining accuracy.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a human-in-the-loop framework that leverages few-shot learning to significantly enhance text classification performance with minimal labeling effort. This has implications for lower costs and resources required for companies to maintain accurate models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper explores using few-shot learning and human feedback to efficiently improve text classification model accuracy with minimal labeling effort across diverse datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating that with just a few labeled examples provided as feedback, the accuracy, precision, and recall of text classification models can be significantly improved across diverse datasets. Specifically:

- The paper employs an iterative process of testing model performance on a dataset, then incorporating human feedback on 10 incorrectly predicted rows, fine-tuning the model, and re-evaluating performance. This is repeated over multiple iterations.

- Experiments are conducted using models like BERT, GPT-3.5, and SetFit on datasets like Amazon reviews, financial phrases, Craigslist, and TREC.

- Results show consistent improvements in accuracy, precision, and recall as more human feedback is provided, proving that only a small number of labeled examples are needed to enhance model performance.

So in summary, the key contribution is providing evidence that text classification models can learn effectively from limited labeled data through a continuous human feedback loop, rather than requiring millions of labeled examples as in traditional training approaches. This has significant practical implications for efficiently improving model accuracy with minimal labeling effort.
