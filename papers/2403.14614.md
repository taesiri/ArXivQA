# [AdaIR: Adaptive All-in-One Image Restoration via Frequency Mining and   Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Image restoration is an important task that aims to recover a clean image from its degraded version containing corruptions like noise, blur, haze etc. Existing methods either focus on individual restoration tasks and don't generalize to multiple degradations, or train separate models for each task which is computationally expensive. Also, they operate only in the spatial domain without considering frequency domain information. However, different degradations affect different frequency subbands of an image.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes AdaIR, an adaptive all-in-one image restoration framework that handles multiple degradations in a single model. It utilizes both spatial and frequency domain information for effective restoration. The key components are:

1) Frequency Mining Module (FMiM): It extracts low and high frequency features from the input guided by the spectra decomposition of the degraded image. The decomposition boundary is determined adaptively based on the corruption type.

2) Frequency Modulation Module (FMoM): It refines the mined frequency features by facilitating interaction between them to handle diverse degradations. It allows exchange of complementary details across frequencies.

3) These modulated features are integrated back into the main network through a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to enable progressive reconstruction.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel frequency mining and modulation blocks for adaptive all-in-one image restoration utilizing both spatial and frequency information.

2) Outperforms state-of-the-art on image dehazing, deraining, denoising, deblurring and low-light enhancement tasks under both all-in-one and individual settings, demonstrating effectiveness.

3) Analyses showing the model learns better discrimination of degradation types and is more parameter-efficient than competitors like PromptIR and AirNet.

In summary, it proposes frequency domain guidance for spatial restoration networks to make them robust for multiple distortion types in a computationally efficient single framework.
