# [CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive   Critiquing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1. Can large language models (LLMs) self-correct their outputs in a manner analogous to human interaction with tools, without requiring further training? 

The paper hypothesizes that LLMs can leverage external tools through natural interaction to validate and iteratively improve their own outputs, similar to how humans use tools like search engines for fact checking.

2. Is external feedback through tool interaction crucial for LLMs to reliably self-verify and self-improve?

The paper hypothesizes that relying solely on LLMs' internal knowledge without external feedback would be inadequate for consistent self-verification and correction. Interaction with tools provides vital external signals.

3. How effective is the proposed CRITIC framework in enhancing LLM performance across diverse tasks compared to prior methods?

The paper hypothesizes that by supporting interpretable verification and iterative correction using appropriate tools, the CRITIC framework can consistently improve over baselines across tasks like QA, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction.

In summary, the core research questions focus on whether LLMs can self-correct by interacting with tools without further training, the importance of external feedback, and evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed CRITIC framework. The experiments aim to test these hypotheses across different tasks and models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new framework called CRITIC (Self-Cor\textbf{r}ecting w\textbf{i}th \textbf{T}ool-\textbf{I}nteractive \textbf{C}ritiquing) that enables large language models (LLMs) to verify and iteratively improve their own outputs by interacting with external tools. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the CRITIC framework seem to be:

- It allows "black box" LLMs to validate and correct their outputs in a human-like manner by utilizing external tools like search engines and code interpreters. 

- It employs a "verify-then-correct" process where the LLM first interacts with a tool to verify the desired attributes of its initial output, receives critiques from this verification, and then generates an improved output based on the feedback.

- This verification-correction cycle can be repeated iteratively to enable continuous output enhancement.

- It aims to enhance LLM performance without requiring additional training data or corpora, relying only on few-shot in-context learning.

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CRITIC consistently improves performance of LLMs like ChatGPT across diverse tasks like question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the novel CRITIC framework to empower LLMs to self-verify and self-improve their outputs by interfacing with the external world in a human-like manner. The key insight is that external feedback is crucial for robust and reliable self-correction.

In summary, the authors highlight opportunities to enhance CRITIC's versatility, automation, fairness, privacy, reliability analysis, multimodality, and efficiency as promising avenues for future work. The overarching goal is to develop CRITIC into a general framework that can robustly improve LLMs across diverse real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CRITIC, a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to self-correct their outputs through interaction with external tools. CRITIC has a verify-then-correct process where the LLM first generates an initial output, then interacts with appropriate tools like search engines or code interpreters to validate the output and generate critiques. Based on the critiques, the LLM revises its output to correct any errors or issues. This process can be iteratively repeated to progressively improve the output. The key benefit of CRITIC is that it allows black-box LLMs to self-improve their performance by leveraging external feedback, without requiring any further training or human annotation. Experiments on question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances LLMs like GPT-3.5 across diverse tasks. The results highlight the importance of tool interaction, as relying solely on the LLM's own critiques leads to marginal gains. Overall, CRITIC offers a general and practical approach to promote the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs through critical thinking skills.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CRITIC, a novel framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-correct their outputs through tool-interactive critiquing. CRITIC allows frozen, black-box LLMs to progressively improve their performance on tasks like question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction. 

The key innovation is using in-context learning to teach LLMs to leverage appropriate external tools (e.g. search engines, code interpreters) to verify aspects of their initial output, generate critiques, and then correct the output based on the feedback. This human-like verify-then-correct cycle can be iterated, facilitating continuous improvements without any model retraining.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces CRITIC, a framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and iteratively self-correct their outputs through interaction with external tools. The method consists of two key steps - verification and correction. Given an initial output, CRITIC first interacts with appropriate external tools like search engines or code interpreters to generate critiques evaluating certain aspects like truthfulness or correctness. It then revises the initial output based on the feedback from the tools to produce an improved output. This verify-then-correct process can be repeated, enabling the LLM to continuously refine its outputs. The core idea is to exploit LLMs' few-shot learning capabilities to learn to leverage external tool APIs and critiques for introspective verification and iterative correction, without requiring additional training data or annotations. Experiments across question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction tasks demonstrate that tool-interactive critiquing consistently enhances LLMs' performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my review, this paper proposes a framework called CRITIC that allows large language models (LLMs) to verify and iteratively correct their own outputs through interaction with external tools. The key problems it aims to address are:

1) LLMs sometimes exhibit inconsistent or problematic behaviors like hallucinating facts, generating flawed code, or creating offensive content. This hampers trust in these models. 

2) Traditional approaches to mitigate such issues rely on expensive human annotations or task-specific training data. This is challenging to obtain at scale.

3) Humans can refine their initial outputs by using tools like search engines or code interpreters. But LLMs lack this ability currently as they are "black boxes".

4) There is a need for LLMs to validate and amend their outputs without requiring further training or annotations. The CRITIC framework allows doing this by interacting with tools.

In summary, the key problem is enabling LLMs to self-verify and self-improve their outputs in a human-like manner by leveraging external tools. CRITIC provides a novel framework to achieve this goal in a sample-efficient way without needing extra annotations or model re-training.
