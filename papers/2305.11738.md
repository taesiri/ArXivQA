# [CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive   Critiquing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1. Can large language models (LLMs) self-correct their outputs in a manner analogous to human interaction with tools, without requiring further training? 

The paper hypothesizes that LLMs can leverage external tools through natural interaction to validate and iteratively improve their own outputs, similar to how humans use tools like search engines for fact checking.

2. Is external feedback through tool interaction crucial for LLMs to reliably self-verify and self-improve?

The paper hypothesizes that relying solely on LLMs' internal knowledge without external feedback would be inadequate for consistent self-verification and correction. Interaction with tools provides vital external signals.

3. How effective is the proposed CRITIC framework in enhancing LLM performance across diverse tasks compared to prior methods?

The paper hypothesizes that by supporting interpretable verification and iterative correction using appropriate tools, the CRITIC framework can consistently improve over baselines across tasks like QA, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction.

In summary, the core research questions focus on whether LLMs can self-correct by interacting with tools without further training, the importance of external feedback, and evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed CRITIC framework. The experiments aim to test these hypotheses across different tasks and models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new framework called CRITIC (Self-Cor\textbf{r}ecting w\textbf{i}th \textbf{T}ool-\textbf{I}nteractive \textbf{C}ritiquing) that enables large language models (LLMs) to verify and iteratively improve their own outputs by interacting with external tools. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the CRITIC framework seem to be:

- It allows "black box" LLMs to validate and correct their outputs in a human-like manner by utilizing external tools like search engines and code interpreters. 

- It employs a "verify-then-correct" process where the LLM first interacts with a tool to verify the desired attributes of its initial output, receives critiques from this verification, and then generates an improved output based on the feedback.

- This verification-correction cycle can be repeated iteratively to enable continuous output enhancement.

- It aims to enhance LLM performance without requiring additional training data or corpora, relying only on few-shot in-context learning.

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CRITIC consistently improves performance of LLMs like ChatGPT across diverse tasks like question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing the novel CRITIC framework to empower LLMs to self-verify and self-improve their outputs by interfacing with the external world in a human-like manner. The key insight is that external feedback is crucial for robust and reliable self-correction.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is an analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of improving large language models: 

\begin{itemize}
\item This paper introduces CRITIC, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-correct their outputs by interacting with external tools. This is a unique approach compared to most prior work that focuses on training or fine-tuning LLMs.

\item The central idea of leveraging external feedback for self-improvement is innovative. Most prior efforts on mitigating issues like hallucination or toxicity rely on training with human annotations or reinforcement learning from scratch. CRITIC provides a more accessible method.

\item CRITIC does not require any additional training of the base LLM, unlike methods like fine-tuning, self-training, or reinforcement learning. This makes it readily applicable to any frozen LLM model accessible via an API.

\item The tool-interaction enabled by CRITIC provides targeted, actionable feedback to guide the LLM's correction process. This is more explicit than scalar rewards used in RL and more reliable than an LLM's own critiques.

\item CRITIC demonstrates strong performance across diverse tasks like QA, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction. Many prior efforts are narrower in scope or task-specific. The generality of CRITIC across models and applications is noteworthy.

\item An important finding is that solely relying on self-verification by the LLM is unreliable, highlighting the value of external tool feedback. This contrasts with some works that depend primarily on an LLM's confidence estimates.

\item Limitations include increased latency due to tool interactions, reliance on prompt engineering, and need to identify suitable tools for a given task. But the paper acknowledges these limitations clearly.

\item Overall, CRITIC makes important contributions regarding the combination of in-context learning and tool interaction for self-improvement. The principles could inspire more research into trustworthy LLMs.
\end{itemize}

In summary, this paper introduces a novel and generalizable framework for LLMs to leverage external feedback for self-verification and correction. The tool-interactive approach is creative and impactful, demonstrating improvements without additional training. The findings also highlight the limitations of self-supervision and the importance of reliable external feedback.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring the effectiveness of CRITIC on more diverse tasks and settings beyond the ones evaluated in the paper. For example, supporting translation or multilingual tasks by incorporating dictionaries, verifying complex mathematical solutions using WolframAlpha, providing feedback through simulated environments, and expanding to other modalities like image, video, etc.

- Developing methods to automate tool selection for CRITIC instead of pre-specifying tools for different tasks. The authors suggest this could be done via in-context learning by providing different tools for different input-output examples.

- Reducing the need for manual prompt engineering in CRITIC by exploring ways for LLMs to learn to interact with tools more efficiently without relying on re-encoded long context demonstrations.

- Evaluating and addressing potential biases introduced by the tools used in CRITIC to ensure fairness.

- Implementing security measures like data anonymization and encryption to protect privacy when interacting with external tools through APIs.

- Conducting further analysis into the truthfulness and reliability of LLMs' outputs using CRITIC or related frameworks.

- Exploring the application of CRITIC to other modalities beyond just text, such as validating outputs for vision, speech, robotics systems.

- Investigating methods to reduce the latency overhead introduced by iterative verification and correction.

In summary, the authors highlight opportunities to enhance CRITIC's versatility, automation, fairness, privacy, reliability analysis, multimodality, and efficiency as promising avenues for future work. The overarching goal is to develop CRITIC into a general framework that can robustly improve LLMs across diverse real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CRITIC, a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to self-correct their outputs through interaction with external tools. CRITIC has a verify-then-correct process where the LLM first generates an initial output, then interacts with appropriate tools like search engines or code interpreters to validate the output and generate critiques. Based on the critiques, the LLM revises its output to correct any errors or issues. This process can be iteratively repeated to progressively improve the output. The key benefit of CRITIC is that it allows black-box LLMs to self-improve their performance by leveraging external feedback, without requiring any further training or human annotation. Experiments on question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances LLMs like GPT-3.5 across diverse tasks. The results highlight the importance of tool interaction, as relying solely on the LLM's own critiques leads to marginal gains. Overall, CRITIC offers a general and practical approach to promote the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs through critical thinking skills.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CRITIC, a novel framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-correct their outputs through tool-interactive critiquing. CRITIC allows frozen, black-box LLMs to progressively improve their performance on tasks like question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction. 

The key innovation is using in-context learning to teach LLMs to leverage appropriate external tools (e.g. search engines, code interpreters) to verify aspects of their initial output, generate critiques, and then correct the output based on the feedback. This human-like verify-then-correct cycle can be iterated, facilitating continuous improvements without any model retraining. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate CRITIC consistently enhances LLM performance and reliability. The results also reveal LLMs struggle to self-verify without tool interaction, underscoring the importance of incorporating external feedback for LLM self-improvement.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces CRITIC, a framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and iteratively self-correct their outputs through interaction with external tools. The method consists of two key steps - verification and correction. Given an initial output, CRITIC first interacts with appropriate external tools like search engines or code interpreters to generate critiques evaluating certain aspects like truthfulness or correctness. It then revises the initial output based on the feedback from the tools to produce an improved output. This verify-then-correct process can be repeated, enabling the LLM to continuously refine its outputs. The core idea is to exploit LLMs' few-shot learning capabilities to learn to leverage external tool APIs and critiques for introspective verification and iterative correction, without requiring additional training data or annotations. Experiments across question answering, program synthesis, and toxicity reduction tasks demonstrate that tool-interactive critiquing consistently enhances LLMs' performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my review, this paper proposes a framework called CRITIC that allows large language models (LLMs) to verify and iteratively correct their own outputs through interaction with external tools. The key problems it aims to address are:

1) LLMs sometimes exhibit inconsistent or problematic behaviors like hallucinating facts, generating flawed code, or creating offensive content. This hampers trust in these models. 

2) Traditional approaches to mitigate such issues rely on expensive human annotations or task-specific training data. This is challenging to obtain at scale.

3) Humans can refine their initial outputs by using tools like search engines or code interpreters. But LLMs lack this ability currently as they are "black boxes".

4) There is a need for LLMs to validate and amend their outputs without requiring further training or annotations. The CRITIC framework allows doing this by interacting with tools.

In summary, the key problem is enabling LLMs to self-verify and self-improve their outputs in a human-like manner by leveraging external tools. CRITIC provides a novel framework to achieve this goal in a sample-efficient way without needing extra annotations or model re-training.
