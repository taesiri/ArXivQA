# [Evaluating Fairness in Self-supervised and Supervised Models for   Sequential Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01640)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have shown promise for learning from unlabeled timeseries data, but their fairness properties have not been studied, especially compared to supervised models. 
- Fairness is important to evaluate for human-centric applications like healthcare, where biases could lead to harmful impacts on underprivileged groups.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a systematic comparison of over 30 supervised and SSL models on a multi-year health timeseries dataset for an in-hospital mortality prediction task.
- Evaluate performance using AUC-ROC scores. Assess fairness using the Error Rate Ratio metric between privileged and unprivileged groups across protected attributes like gender, age, ethnicity. 
- Also compare learned representations between models using Centered Kernel Alignment conditioned on protected attributes.

Key Findings:
- With the right fine-tuning strategy, SSL can match the performance of supervised models while enhancing fairness by 27%, with just 1% drop in AUC-ROC score.
- Differences exist in learned representations between SSL and supervised models, with higher similarity for certain privileged groups. This could explain improved fairness of SSL.
- The level of supervision during SSL fine-tuning impacts model fairness significantly. Moderate supervision leads to the best fairness-performance trade-off.

Main Contributions:
- First study to systematically analyze the impact of pre-training and fine-tuning strategies on fairness in SSL versus supervised models for timeseries tasks.
- Demonstrates SSL's potential for human-centric applications by showing improved fairness over supervised learning with minimal performance loss.
- Analysis of differences in learned representations provides insights into why SSL can improve fairness.
- Underscores the need to evaluate both performance and fairness metrics when comparing ML models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how different levels of supervision and fine-tuning in self-supervised learning affect model performance, fairness across protected attributes, and learned representations compared to supervised approaches using multi-year health records timeseries data, finding that certain self-supervised strategies can match performance while significantly improving fairness with minor losses to accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) For the first time, the authors look into fine-grained differences in the layer, model, and metric level between supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) models. They move away from conventional performance-centric assessments and adopt a human-centric perspective that integrates fairness metrics to evaluate how these differences affect model outcomes.

2) The authors train and compare a large number (>$30) of models with various levels of supervision and fine-tuning on multi-year health records timeseries data. They show that SSL performs on par with supervised models, and more notably, they observe up to a 27% increase in fairness accompanied by only a 1% loss in performance for certain fine-tuning strategies. 

3) The authors compare the learned representations using the latent similarity between supervised and SSL models, which reveals discrepancies in latent representations across different demographic groups.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic comparison of supervised and self-supervised models for sequential data that goes beyond performance assessments to also evaluate fairness and learned representations. The key finding is that SSL can achieve comparable performance to supervised learning while significantly improving fairness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a SimCLR model variant for self-supervised learning on time series health data. What were the key components and architectural choices of this SimCLR variant? How were they adapted for time series data?

2. The paper conducts experiments with different fine-tuning strategies for the SSL model, gradually unfreezing encoder layers before fine-tuning. What is the rationale behind this gradual unfreezing approach? How does it balance self-supervision and downstream task supervision?

3. The SSL models are compared to a fully supervised baseline in terms of performance, fairness metrics, and representation learning. What metrics were used for each of these comparisons? What conclusions were drawn from the results? 

4. For the fairness evaluation, the paper uses error rate ratio across different protected attributes or demographic groups. Why was this specific metric chosen over other fairness metrics? What fairness considerations does it aim to address?

5. The findings show improved fairness for SSL models over the supervised baseline. What possible reasons are discussed that could explain why self-supervision enhances fairness in this case?

6. Representation similarity between models was evaluated using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) conditioned on protected attributes. What was revealed about differences in learned representations for certain demographic groups? How could this analysis explain observed fairness differences?

7. What dataset was used for the experiments and evaluation? What was the specific prediction task? How were protected attributes defined and handled in the data preprocessing?

8. The paper concludes that SSL shows promise for scarce labeled data settings like healthcare. What characteristics of the method make it suitable for such real-world domains? What additional experiments are suggested for future work?

9. Beyond performance and fairness, what other evaluation criteria should be considered when assessing machine learning models intended for real-world usage? What challenges does this pose?

10. What implications does this work have for the use of self-supervised learning in high-stakes domains like healthcare? How could the methodology and findings provide guidance to practitioners when evaluating model options?
