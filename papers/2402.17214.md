# [CharacterGen: Efficient 3D Character Generation from Single Images with   Multi-View Pose Canonicalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating high-quality 3D characters from single images is challenging due to complex body poses, self-occlusion, and pose ambiguity. Existing methods struggle with capturing detailed textures or handling diverse poses effectively.

Proposed Solution - CharacterGen:
- A streamlined pipeline for generating 3D anime characters in canonical A-poses from single images.

Key Components:
- Multi-view image generation: An image-conditioned diffusion model that transforms input images into multi-view consistent images of characters in canonical A-poses. Retains detailed features and handles varying poses.

- Dataset: Curated a dataset called Anime3D of 13,746 anime characters rendered from multiple views and poses to train the model.

- 3D Character Generation: A transformer-based sparse-view reconstruction model to generate detailed 3D models from the multi-view canonical pose images. Additional texture back-projection is used to refine textures.

Main Contributions:  
- Image-conditioned diffusion model that canonicalizes poses while generating consistent multi-view images capturing local features.
- An efficient streamlined pipeline combining the above diffusion model and a reconstruction model for 3D character generation.
- A multi-pose, multi-view anime character dataset called Anime3D with 13,746 characters for training and evaluation.

The proposed CharacterGen method can efficiently transform single-view images of characters in arbitrary poses into detailed 3D models in canonical poses, overcoming challenges imposed by complex poses. The canonical pose benefits downstream rigging and animation. Experiments demonstrate CharacterGen's ability to produce high quality 3D anime characters.
