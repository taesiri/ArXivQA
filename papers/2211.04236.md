# [Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04236)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not seem to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. The paper introduces a new method called Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion (SED) for text generation using continuous diffusion models. The key ideas behind SED appear to be:- Projecting discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, allowing diffusion models designed for continuous data to be applied to text.- Using self-conditioning, where the denoising model's estimate of the data at the previous diffusion step is fed back as input at the current step. This is shown to improve sample quality.- Introducing classifier-free guidance to the text domain, also improving sample quality.The paper then evaluates SED on unconditional and conditional text generation tasks, comparing it to autoregressive baselines. The main findings seem to be:- SED can generate high quality text samples that approach the quality of autoregressive methods.- SED provides more flexible text generation abilities compared to autoregressive models, such as infilling masked spans.- The design choices of self-conditioning and diffusing in a pretrained embedding space are important for SED's strong performance.So in summary, there is no single focused research question, but the paper explores a new technique for applying continuous diffusion models to discrete text data and analyzes its performance compared to autoregressive baselines. The main hypothesis appears to be that continuous diffusion can be competitive with autoregressive models for text if adapted properly.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is proposing Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion (SED), a continuous diffusion mechanism that operates on token embeddings, for conditional and unconditional text generation. The key ideas are:- Performing continuous diffusion in the embedding space of tokens rather than directly on discrete tokens. This allows leveraging advances in continuous diffusion modeling.- Using self-conditioning and fixed pretrained embeddings, which are identified as important factors to make continuous text diffusion work well. - Applying classifier-free guidance to text data for the first time, improving sample quality.- Showing that SED can match the performance of autoregressive models on generic language tasks, while being more flexible (e.g. for text in-filling).In summary, the main contribution is developing the first generally-capable continuous diffusion model for text generation, which opens up new possibilities for improving text generation using ideas from the continuous image diffusion literature. The results demonstrate SED's potential as an alternative to autoregressive models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The use of continuous diffusion models for text generation is novel and an interesting approach to generating discrete text data. Most prior work has focused on discrete diffusion methods or auto-regressive models for text. Using continuous embeddings as the diffusion space is a clever way to adapt powerful continuous diffusion techniques to language data.- Self-conditioning seems to be a key contribution here for making continuous text diffusion work well. This idea of feeding the model's own predictions back in for future denoising steps has shown strong results in other diffusion model works like Analog Bits for images. The ablation studies demonstrate the large gains in sample quality from self-conditioning.- Applying classifier-free guidance to text is another novel adaptation from recent image diffusion models. The results show this can substantially improve sample quality, similar to its impact in the image domain.- The overall sample quality and metrics like AR NLL and human evaluations demonstrate these continuous text diffusion models can reach comparable levels to state-of-the-art auto-regressive models. This helps validate the potential of this approach as an alternative to AR for text.- However, the models tested are still fairly small compared to cutting edge AR models with billions of parameters. Further scaling up may be important to fully match the state-of-the-art in areas like coherence over long text.- There is likely much more room for improvement by applying other recent advances from the image diffusion literature like sampling speedups. The sampling process is currently slow.Overall, this paper introduces a promising new approach to text modeling that manages to adapt the latest innovations in image diffusion models. The results are very encouraging and validate continuous diffusion as viable for generating high-quality discrete text data. This could open up further advances by building on top of this novel text diffusion framework in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring ways to speed up the sampling process for text diffusion models, similar to advances made in image diffusion models. The current sampling process for their SED model is inefficient.- Developing better embedding spaces specifically optimized for diffusion. The SED model relies on using pretrained embeddings like BERT, which may not be ideal. Training the full model end-to-end could yield better results.- Scaling the models up to larger sizes to better understand the limits of text diffusion models and compare to state-of-the-art autoregressive models. The authors were only able to train up to 420M parameters.- Devising better evaluation benchmarks, especially for text in-filling tasks that diffusion may be particularly suited for. Current benchmarks are more tailored to autoregressive models. - Incorporating more of the advances made in continuous image diffusion into the text domain, like sampling speed improvements and classifier-free guidance. The authors were only able to implement a subset thus far.- Exploring the unique capabilities of diffusion for bidirectional text generation, like infilling, which autoregressive models struggle with. The flexibility of diffusion could shine in these areas.- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics for text generation. Metrics like NLL and unigram entropy can be gamed. New metrics suited for diffusion are needed.In summary, the key directions are improving the sampling efficiency, scaling up the model size, devising better diffusion-optimized embedding spaces and benchmarks, transferring more advances from image diffusion, and leveraging the flexibility of diffusion for tasks like in-filling. Developing better evaluation metrics also remains an open challenge.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion (SED), a new method for text generation using continuous diffusion models. SED works by projecting discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, where diffusion and denoising are performed. Key innovations include using fixed pretrained embeddings rather than learned embeddings, adding a bottleneck to reduce embedding dimension, and using self-conditioning to refine the denoised embeddings over multiple passes. SED is evaluated on unconditional and conditional text generation tasks, where it is shown to achieve results competitive with autoregressive baselines. The method allows diffusion models to be applied successfully to text for the first time. Limitations are the inefficient sampling process and reliance on a pretrained embedding space. Overall, SED shows promise as an alternative to autoregressive models for text generation, and future work can build on these results by incorporating recent advances in continuous diffusion modeling.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion (SED), a continuous diffusion model for text generation. Diffusion models have shown great success for image generation, but applying them to discrete text data is challenging. SED handles this by performing diffusion in a continuous embedding space rather than directly on tokens. Specifically, tokens are projected to fixed pretrained embeddings. Diffusion and denoising are performed in this continuous space. A trainable readout matrix then converts the diffused embeddings back to tokens for text generation. Several innovations enable SED to generate high quality text. Self-conditioning improves coherence by passing the model's predictions at the previous timestep as input to the next. Guidance and classifier-free guidance further improve sample quality for conditional generation. Experiments show SED can perform various text generation tasks like unconditional, conditional, and infilling generation. The approach is comparable to autoregressive transformers of similar size, achieving slightly worse likelihood but higher diversity. Ablation studies analyze design choices like embedding dimension. Overall, SED demonstrates the promise of adapting recent diffusion advances to generate natural language.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion (SED), a continuous diffusion mechanism that operates on token embeddings to enable flexible and scalable diffusion models for text generation. SED projects tokens into a continuous embedding space, then applies a continuous denoising diffusion process in that space. This allows leveraging recent advances in continuous image diffusion for text modeling. Key components of SED include: 1) diffusing in a fixed pretrained embedding space rather than learning embeddings as part of the model, 2) using a self-conditioning scheme where the diffusion model's estimate of the original data at the previous step is fed as input to the model to progressively refine the estimate, and 3) introducing span masking and classifier-free guidance during training to enable strong conditional generation capabilities. The method is evaluated on unconditional and conditional text generation tasks, where it is shown to produce samples comparable to state-of-the-art autoregressive models. The work demonstrates the promise of adapting continuous diffusion techniques to generate high-quality text samples.
