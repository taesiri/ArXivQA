# Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion for Text Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not seem to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. The paper introduces a new method called Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion (SED) for text generation using continuous diffusion models. The key ideas behind SED appear to be:- Projecting discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, allowing diffusion models designed for continuous data to be applied to text.- Using self-conditioning, where the denoising model's estimate of the data at the previous diffusion step is fed back as input at the current step. This is shown to improve sample quality.- Introducing classifier-free guidance to the text domain, also improving sample quality.The paper then evaluates SED on unconditional and conditional text generation tasks, comparing it to autoregressive baselines. The main findings seem to be:- SED can generate high quality text samples that approach the quality of autoregressive methods.- SED provides more flexible text generation abilities compared to autoregressive models, such as infilling masked spans.- The design choices of self-conditioning and diffusing in a pretrained embedding space are important for SED's strong performance.So in summary, there is no single focused research question, but the paper explores a new technique for applying continuous diffusion models to discrete text data and analyzes its performance compared to autoregressive baselines. The main hypothesis appears to be that continuous diffusion can be competitive with autoregressive models for text if adapted properly.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is proposing Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion (SED), a continuous diffusion mechanism that operates on token embeddings, for conditional and unconditional text generation. The key ideas are:- Performing continuous diffusion in the embedding space of tokens rather than directly on discrete tokens. This allows leveraging advances in continuous diffusion modeling.- Using self-conditioning and fixed pretrained embeddings, which are identified as important factors to make continuous text diffusion work well. - Applying classifier-free guidance to text data for the first time, improving sample quality.- Showing that SED can match the performance of autoregressive models on generic language tasks, while being more flexible (e.g. for text in-filling).In summary, the main contribution is developing the first generally-capable continuous diffusion model for text generation, which opens up new possibilities for improving text generation using ideas from the continuous image diffusion literature. The results demonstrate SED's potential as an alternative to autoregressive models.
