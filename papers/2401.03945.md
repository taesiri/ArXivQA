# [SpeechAgents: Human-Communication Simulation with Multi-Modal   Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03945)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Human communication is complex, involving language, emotions, non-verbal cues across modalities like speech. Simulating such rich human communication can help understand language and interactions.  
- Existing simulation systems have limitations in generating high-quality dialog content without textual references. 
- Current LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on text, lacking multi-modal capabilities.

Proposed Solution - SpeechAgents:
- Uses multi-modal LLM SpeechGPT as the control center for each agent. Agents communicate via speech signals.
- Introduces Multi-Agent Tuning to enhance multi-agent abilities of LLM without compromising general skills. 
- Leverages multi-speaker multi-style vocoder for producing expressive speech outputs.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes the first multi-modal LLM-based multi-agent system for simulating human communication.
- Demonstrates speech signals as an effective medium of communication between agents.
- Introduces Human-Communication Simulation Benchmark with hierarchical scene, role, and script data.
- Shows SpeechAgents can generate dialogues with accurate content, natural rhythm and rich emotions.
- Exhibits strong scalability to 25 agents, applicable for drama and audio book generation.

In summary, the paper presents SpeechAgents, a novel multi-modal multi-agent system for simulating human communication using LLM SpeechGPT. Through innovations like multi-agent tuning, it shows promising performance in producing consistent and high-quality dialogues across modalities and number of agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes SpeechAgents, a multi-modal large language model based multi-agent system that utilizes speech as the medium of communication between agents to simulate human dialogues with consistent content, authentic rhythm, and rich emotions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

1) Building a multi-modal large language model (LLM) based multi-agent system for human communication simulation. This system uses multi-modal LLM as the central control for individual agents and employs multi-modal signals as the medium for information exchange between agents.

2) Proposing Multi-Agent Tuning to enhance the multi-agent capabilities of LLM without compromising general abilities. 

3) Introducing the Human-Communication Simulation Benchmark for evaluating human communication simulation.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing a multi-modal LLM-based multi-agent framework (SpeechAgents) for simulating human communication, along with associated tuning methods and evaluation benchmarks. The system demonstrates the ability to generate human-like dialogues with accurate content, authentic rhythm and rich emotions.
