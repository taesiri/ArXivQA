# [iBOT: Image BERT Pre-Training with Online Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07832)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to effectively perform masked image modeling (MIM) for pre-training Vision Transformers. Specifically, the key questions addressed in the paper are:

1. How to design a proper visual tokenizer for MIM that can transform masked image patches into meaningful supervisory signals? 

2. How to incorporate the visual tokenizer into the MIM framework in an end-to-end manner without needing a separate pre-training stage?

3. Whether the proposed MIM framework with a learnable online tokenizer can achieve superior performance compared to prior arts on various vision tasks.

To summarize, the central hypothesis is that a semantically meaningful visual tokenizer is crucial for MIM to work well for Vision Transformers, and this can be achieved via a self-distillation framework with an online tokenizer that is jointly optimized with the MIM objective. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed framework called iBOT through comprehensive experiments on image classification, robustness evaluation, and dense downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is proposing a self-supervised framework called iBOT that performs masked image modeling using an online tokenizer. Specifically:

- iBOT employs a self-distillation approach to perform masked prediction, where the teacher network acts as the online tokenizer for the student network. This removes the need for a separate pre-trained tokenizer.

- The online tokenizer acquires visual semantics through self-distillation on the class token across different views of an image.

- Using the online tokenizer, iBOT achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification under various settings like k-NN, linear probing, semi-supervised learning, etc.

- Beyond classification, iBOT also shows improved performance on downstream tasks like object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

- Analysis shows iBOT induces emerging local semantic patterns in the patch tokens, which helps with classification accuracy and robustness.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing a masked image modeling framework with an online tokenizer that achieves excellent performance on ImageNet classification and transfer tasks, while also exhibiting interesting semantic properties in the learned representations. The end-to-end learning of the tokenizer jointly with the main model appears to be a novel aspect.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper focuses on masked image modeling (MIM) for vision transformers, which builds off the success of masked language modeling (MLM) in NLP. MIM has been explored in some recent works like BEiT and ViMPAC, but is still an underexplored area compared to global contrastive learning methods like MoCo, SimCLR, etc. This paper provides a new method and strong results for MIM.

- The key novelty is the idea of an "online tokenizer" that is jointly learned along with the MIM objective, rather than relying on a fixed pretrained tokenizer like in BEiT. This allows the tokenizer to be adaptive and tailored for the dataset.

- The results are state-of-the-art across various tasks. The authors achieve 82.3% accuracy on ImageNet linear classification protocol, outperforming prior MIM works like BEiT. The method also achieves strong performance on downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation.

- Compared to global contrastive methods like DINO, this work shows the benefit of modeling local structures via MIM, especially for dense prediction tasks requiring localization. The visualization of emerging semantic patterns in patches is an interesting qualitative analysis.

- The idea of joint learning versus pretrained components seems applicable more broadly. For example, many self-supervised methods pretrain components like predictors or projectors separately. Joint end-to-end learning could be explored there too.

Overall, this paper pushes forward masked modeling for vision transformers, which is relatively underexplored compared to other pretraining approaches. The online tokenizer idea sets it apart from prior MIM works, and the strong empirical results across many tasks help demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. It will likely inspire more research into jointly learned components in self-supervised learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling up the approach to larger datasets (e.g. ImageNet-22K) and larger models (e.g. ViT-L/16 and ViT-H/16) to further explore whether masked image modeling can help Vision Transformers become more scalable to unlabeled data.

- Exploring whether the performance gains of masked image modeling translate well to other visual modalities like video and 3D data. The authors suggest video could be a promising direction.

- Developing more advanced tokenization techniques tailored for visual data that can better capture semantic meaning in images and image patches. The authors indicate the visual tokenizer is currently a limiting factor.

- Extending the framework to multi-modal masked modeling between vision and language, building on recent concurrent work in masked region modeling for vision-language tasks.

- Adapting the approach to other self-supervised objectives beyond the discriminative contrastive learning formulation currently used, to further improve the learned visual representations.

- Investigating how the emerging local semantic patterns in the patch tokens could be further exploited, for example through part-based reasoning, to improve robustness and generalizability.

- Applying the method to more dense prediction tasks beyond classification, detection and segmentation, such as depth estimation, optical flow, etc.

So in summary, the main suggestions are around scaling up the approach, improving the visual tokenization, extending to new data modalities and tasks, and better utilizing the local semantic information. The authors frame masked image modeling as a promising direction to help close the gap with masked language modeling for NLP.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a self-supervised framework called iBOT that performs masked image modeling (MIM) for pre-training Vision Transformers. iBOT uses a teacher-student framework where the teacher network acts as an online tokenizer to provide supervision for the student network to reconstruct masked image patches. Specifically, two augmented views of an image are passed through the teacher and student networks. The student network sees a masked version of the image while the teacher sees the original image. The student must predict the original masked patches using the outputs from the corresponding patches in the teacher network. Additionally, both networks perform self-distillation on the class token between the two views to obtain semantic information. Unlike prior work that uses a pretrained discrete VAE as the tokenizer, iBOT trains the tokenizer jointly with the MIM objective, avoiding the need for a separate pretraining stage. Experiments show iBOT achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification and transfer learning. The learned representations also exhibit semantic patterns in the patch tokens and are robust to image corruptions.
