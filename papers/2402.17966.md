# [Conformer: Embedding Continuous Attention in Vision Transformer for   Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17966)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Operational weather forecasting relies on physics-based models that are computationally expensive. Existing deep learning models for weather forecasting like transformers are discrete and cannot properly model the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics of weather systems. Learning continuity in discrete space-time models is a key challenge.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Conformer, a continuous spatio-temporal vision transformer for weather forecasting. Key ideas:

1) Introduce differentiation as a preprocessing step to prepare discrete data for the continuous model and enable better feature extraction.

2) Propose continuous attention to learn spatio-temporal mappings by converting attention to a differentiable function. This attends across samples of the same variable instead of patches to capture weather dynamics.  

3) Add neural ODE layers to model continuity and use adaptive solvers like Dormand-Prince (Dopri5) for accuracy.

4) Explore normalized derivatives and show different normalization works better for different variables.

Main Contributions:

1) A new architecture Conformer that introduces continuity in vision transformers via continuous attention and neural ODEs to model weather dynamics.

2) Preprocessing with differentiation for improved feature extraction.

3) Analysis of normalization techniques for derivatives in forecasting different weather variables.

4) Conformer outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and physics-based models for weather forecasting across different lead times, even when trained on lower resolution data.

5) Orders of magnitude faster training than other data-driven weather models.

In summary, the paper presents a novel continuous transformer for weather forecasting that models dynamics better than discrete transformers and is more efficient than physics-based models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Conformer, a continuous vision transformer model for weather forecasting that captures spatio-temporal dynamics by implementing continuity in the multi-head attention mechanism through continuous attention and neural ODE layers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing Conformer, a novel spatio-temporal continuous vision transformer for weather forecasting. Specifically:

1) It proposes continuous attention to effectively learn and interpolate the spatio-temporal information for weather forecasting. This allows capturing the continuous dynamics of the weather system better than discrete transformers.

2) It introduces differentiation as a pre-processing step to prepare the discrete data for the continuous model and ensure better feature extraction. 

3) It explores the role of normalized derivatives in the prediction of different weather variables, showing that normalizing the continuous evolution yields different results for each predicted variable.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a continuous vision transformer that can learn spatio-temporal dynamics for weather forecasting in a data-driven and computationally efficient manner.
