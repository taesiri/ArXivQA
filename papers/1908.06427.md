# [Unsupervised Learning of Landmarks by Descriptor Vector Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we learn visual landmarks of object categories (e.g. eyes, nose, mouth for faces) in an unsupervised manner, without requiring manual annotations?The key ideas and contributions are:- The authors establish a connection between visual landmarks and local image descriptors like SIFT. Both aim to establish correspondences between images in a way that is invariant to viewing conditions. - They propose a method called Descriptor Vector Exchange (DVE) to learn descriptors that are distinctive, transformation invariant, and robust to intra-class variations. This allows them to identify visual landmarks.- DVE involves exchanging descriptor vectors between images of different object instances before enforcing geometric consistency. This encourages the descriptors to be valid across different instances.- Experiments show DVE can learn descriptors that work well for both instance-specific matching and as cross-instance landmarks, combining the advantages of both.- DVE matches or exceeds prior state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised landmark learning on face datasets. It also generalizes to animal faces and a robot arm dataset.In summary, the paper proposes a novel technique to learn visual landmarks in an unsupervised manner by connecting ideas from descriptors and establishing cross-instance validity of the descriptors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Establishing a connection between landmark detectors and local image descriptors, noting that both aim to produce embeddings that are distinctive and invariant to certain transformations. Landmarks are invariant to intra-class variations, while descriptors are invariant to viewpoint/illumination changes. - Proposing a new method called Descriptor Vector Exchange (DVE) to learn embeddings that are distinctive, equivariant to transformations, and also invariant to intra-class variations. This allows the embeddings to jointly work as both landmarks and descriptors.- The key idea in DVE is to exchange descriptor vectors between images of different object instances before matching them geometrically. This enforces that the vectors are valid across different identities/instances.- Demonstrating through experiments on human faces, animal faces, and a robotic arm that the DVE embeddings can accurately match points between different instances of an object category, outperforming prior work on landmark localization.- Showing that the learned embeddings can be used for both instance-specific matching like descriptors and semantic correspondence like landmarks, unifying these two concepts.In summary, the main contribution is the proposed DVE method and associated experiments highlighting how it can learn embeddings useful for both descriptor matching and landmark detection in an unsupervised manner. The connection made between descriptors and landmarks is also an important conceptual contribution.
