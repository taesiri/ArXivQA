# [Unsupervised Learning of Landmarks by Descriptor Vector Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we learn visual landmarks of object categories (e.g. eyes, nose, mouth for faces) in an unsupervised manner, without requiring manual annotations?The key ideas and contributions are:- The authors establish a connection between visual landmarks and local image descriptors like SIFT. Both aim to establish correspondences between images in a way that is invariant to viewing conditions. - They propose a method called Descriptor Vector Exchange (DVE) to learn descriptors that are distinctive, transformation invariant, and robust to intra-class variations. This allows them to identify visual landmarks.- DVE involves exchanging descriptor vectors between images of different object instances before enforcing geometric consistency. This encourages the descriptors to be valid across different instances.- Experiments show DVE can learn descriptors that work well for both instance-specific matching and as cross-instance landmarks, combining the advantages of both.- DVE matches or exceeds prior state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised landmark learning on face datasets. It also generalizes to animal faces and a robot arm dataset.In summary, the paper proposes a novel technique to learn visual landmarks in an unsupervised manner by connecting ideas from descriptors and establishing cross-instance validity of the descriptors.
