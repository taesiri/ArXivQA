# [Unsupervised Learning of Landmarks by Descriptor Vector Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06427)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we learn visual landmarks of object categories (e.g. eyes, nose, mouth for faces) in an unsupervised manner, without requiring manual annotations?The key ideas and contributions are:- The authors establish a connection between visual landmarks and local image descriptors like SIFT. Both aim to establish correspondences between images in a way that is invariant to viewing conditions. - They propose a method called Descriptor Vector Exchange (DVE) to learn descriptors that are distinctive, transformation invariant, and robust to intra-class variations. This allows them to identify visual landmarks.- DVE involves exchanging descriptor vectors between images of different object instances before enforcing geometric consistency. This encourages the descriptors to be valid across different instances.- Experiments show DVE can learn descriptors that work well for both instance-specific matching and as cross-instance landmarks, combining the advantages of both.- DVE matches or exceeds prior state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised landmark learning on face datasets. It also generalizes to animal faces and a robot arm dataset.In summary, the paper proposes a novel technique to learn visual landmarks in an unsupervised manner by connecting ideas from descriptors and establishing cross-instance validity of the descriptors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Establishing a connection between landmark detectors and local image descriptors, noting that both aim to produce embeddings that are distinctive and invariant to certain transformations. Landmarks are invariant to intra-class variations, while descriptors are invariant to viewpoint/illumination changes. - Proposing a new method called Descriptor Vector Exchange (DVE) to learn embeddings that are distinctive, equivariant to transformations, and also invariant to intra-class variations. This allows the embeddings to jointly work as both landmarks and descriptors.- The key idea in DVE is to exchange descriptor vectors between images of different object instances before matching them geometrically. This enforces that the vectors are valid across different identities/instances.- Demonstrating through experiments on human faces, animal faces, and a robotic arm that the DVE embeddings can accurately match points between different instances of an object category, outperforming prior work on landmark localization.- Showing that the learned embeddings can be used for both instance-specific matching like descriptors and semantic correspondence like landmarks, unifying these two concepts.In summary, the main contribution is the proposed DVE method and associated experiments highlighting how it can learn embeddings useful for both descriptor matching and landmark detection in an unsupervised manner. The connection made between descriptors and landmarks is also an important conceptual contribution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of unsupervised learning of landmarks:- Overall, this paper presents a novel method called Descriptor Vector Exchange (DVE) for learning dense landmarks without manual supervision. The key idea is to enforce invariance of the learned descriptors to intra-class variations by exchanging descriptors between images. - This builds on prior work like Thewlis et al. (2017) that uses equivariance to image warps as a supervisory signal, but DVE adds a new mechanism to improve generalization across different instances through the descriptor exchange process.- Compared to other recent unsupervised landmark learning methods, this paper shows competitive or superior performance on standard face datasets like MAFL, AFLW, and 300W. The results are on par with state-of-the-art techniques like Zhang et al. (2018), Jakab et al. (2018), and Shu et al. (2018).- A key advantage demonstrated is that DVE can learn descriptors that work well for both instance-specific matching and category-level landmark detection simultaneously. This unifies landmarks and descriptors in a single representation.- The cross-species experiment matching human to animal faces is a novel testbed demonstrating DVE's ability to discover semantically consistent landmarks across categories with large visual variance. This is an interesting capability not extensively evaluated by other papers.- One limitation is that DVE has only been demonstrated for faces and relatively simple objects like a robotic arm. Testing on more complex object categories could reveal useful challenges. - Overall, I would summarize that this paper makes a solid incremental contribution over prior work by developing a new technique to improve generalization of learned landmarks across instances. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art capabilities, especially the ability to jointly learn landmarks and descriptors. Expanding the approach to more diverse and complex objects could be an interesting direction for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Further exploring the connection between landmarks and descriptors to develop joint representations that have advantages of both. They propose ideas like coupling the landmark positions and descriptor vectors, or using landmarks to guide the feature learning process.- Applying the unsupervised landmark learning approach to other categories beyond faces, such as human bodies. The equivariance and vector exchange principles should also apply in those settings but may require adaptations.- Investigating other ways to regularize the embedding space besides vector exchange, potentially leading to further improvements in generalization across instances.- Leveraging additional unlabeled data like videos to provide more natural warps and transformations for equivariance. This could improve results without needing to generate synthetic warps.- Exploring semi-supervised formulations where some labeled data is available, in addition to unlabeled data. The labeled data could guide the model while the unlabeled data provides a regularization effect.- Developing methods to jointly learn categories and landmarks in a completely unsupervised way, removing the need to pre-define the object category.In summary, they propose further exploring joint landmark-descriptor models, applying the approach to new domains, regularization techniques, using more natural data, and extending to semi-supervised and multi-category settings.
