# [One Pass Streaming Algorithm for Super Long Token Attention   Approximation in Sublinear Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14652)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel one-pass streaming algorithm to efficiently compute approximate attention for transformer models over very long input sequences using sublinear $o(n)$ space. Motivated by the high memory and computational costs of attention with long contexts, the authors leverage prior work on low-rank attention approximations and combine this with randomized sketching to reduce the space complexity. Specifically, the algorithm constructs low-rank factor matrices $U_1, U_2$ and sketches these using CountSketch and JL transforms rather than directly caching the large Key and Value matrices. By storing only the sketches, decoding can be performed with sparse recovery, provably approximating attention in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time using just $o(n)$ space. As sequence length grows, the error guarantee diminishes while memory remains nearly constant. This unique trait makes the approach well-suited for streaming applications with long contexts like dialog and text analysis, overcoming bottlenecks faced by standard attention. The analysis formally states approximation guarantees and space/time complexity. Overall, this is an important contribution towards efficient large language models for reaching artificial general intelligence capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a one-pass streaming algorithm that uses sublinear space to approximately compute attention for transformer models over very long input sequences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel one-pass streaming algorithm (Algorithm 1) that can approximate the attention computation in transformer models using sublinear space $o(n)$ when the context length $n$ is very large. 

Specifically, the algorithm employs sketching techniques to sample and store compressed versions of the key and value matrices using $o(n)$ space. It processes the query, key, and value matrices in a single streaming pass. Despite using limited memory, the algorithm provides strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of the approximate attention output.

As stated in Theorem 1 (the main result), for input dimension $d=O(\log n)$, the algorithm uses only $O(\epsilon_1^{-1} k n^{o(1)} + \epsilon_2^{-2} n^{o(1)})$ space, outputs a $k$-sparse approximation to the attention, and achieves error $\|T - \text{Attn}(Q,K,V)\|_2 \leq (1+\epsilon_1)\mathrm{OPT} + \epsilon_2$ where OPT is the error of best $k$-sparse approximation.

Therefore, the key innovation is enabling memory-efficient streaming attention computation on very long sequences, which helps address computational bottlenecks in deploying large language models. This could facilitate models handling longer contexts and move towards artificial general intelligence capabilities.
