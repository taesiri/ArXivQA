# [Retrieve, Merge, Predict: Augmenting Tables with Data Lakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Augmenting a base table with additional relevant information from a data lake can improve performance of machine learning models built on that table. However, discovering relevant tables in large data lakes is challenging.
- The process involves multiple steps - retrieving candidate tables, selecting tables to merge, handling joins, aggregation, and finally training a model. Each step has several alternatives and it's unclear how to select the best methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a benchmark called YADL (Yet Another Data Lake) based on the YAGO knowledge base to evaluate different methods for the augmentation pipeline.
- They implement a full prototype pipeline with alternatives for candidate retrieval, join selection, aggregation, and machine learning methods.
- The pipeline is evaluated on YADL and a real data lake (Open Data US) using several base tables from different domains. Multiple metrics like prediction performance, time and memory are reported.

Key Contributions:
- YADL benchmark data lake that allows controlled testing of table augmentation techniques from data lakes.
- Implementation of a complete pipeline for augmenting base tables via joins.
- Extensive experimental analysis to compare different methods for the key steps of retrieval, merging, aggregation and prediction.
- Key findings: accurate retrieval of join candidates impacts end performance the most; join selection less critical; simple aggregations are faster and yield similar performance to complex techniques.
- Guidelines for making method choices based on use case requirements and tradeoffs between prediction performance vs compute resources.

In summary, the paper presents a benchmark and pipeline to analyze techniques for the problem of augmenting base tables using joins from data lakes. The exhaustive experiments provide useful guidelines on the impact of different steps and highlight accurate join candidate retrieval as the most significant factor.
