# [Anomaly Detection via Learning-Based Sequential Controlled Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of anomaly detection among a set of processes. The goal is to identify which processes are anomalous. To do this, a decision-making agent can sequentially select a subset of the processes to observe at each time instant. However, each observation is noisy (can be flipped with some probability) and incurs a cost. Therefore, the agent must balance the trade-off between accurately detecting anomalies (delay and accuracy) while minimizing the total sensing cost.

Proposed Solution:
The authors formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The belief vector on the state of the processes is defined as the state. Choosing which subset of processes to observe next is the action. Two reward functions are proposed based on the Bayesian log likelihood ratio and entropy to encourage building confidence on the true state. The problem reduces to finding a policy (mapping from belief state to action) that maximizes long-term cumulative reward.  

Two approaches are presented to obtain good policies:

1) Deep reinforcement learning algorithms: Two RL algorithms are designed - deep Q-learning and actor-critic. These optimize policies based on learned value functions and directly optimize the policy respectively.

2) Deep active inference: Models the agent's internal model of environment statistics. Optimizes a policy by minimizing variational free energy, which is the divergence between the internal model and external observations.   

Main Contributions:

- Novel problem formulation for anomaly detection using Markov decision processes and suitable reward functions

- Two customized deep reinforcement learning algorithms using deep Q-learning and actor-critic 

- A deep active inference algorithm that relies on learning a generative model

- Extensive experiments comparing algorithms in terms of accuracy, delay and cost

- Key insights on adapting algorithms to problem statistics and recommendations on selecting suitable algorithms

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive framework and deep learning solutions for sequential decision making in anomaly detection problems, balancing accuracy, delay and sensing costs.
