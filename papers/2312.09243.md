# [OccNeRF: Self-Supervised Multi-Camera Occupancy Prediction with Neural   Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09243)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes OccNeRF, a self-supervised method for multi-camera 3D occupancy prediction from images alone, without any ground truth labels. To handle unbounded outdoor scenes, they parameterize the occupancy field to contract the infinite space into a bounded volume. They adopt neural volume rendering to convert the predicted occupancy into multi-view depth maps, which are supervised via multi-frame photometric consistency losses like many self-supervised depth estimation approaches. For semantic occupancy prediction, they employ prompt engineering strategies to obtain pseudo-labels from an off-the-shelf open-vocabulary segmentation model without finetuning, providing semantic supervision. Experiments on nuScenes dataset for monocular depth estimation and semantic occupancy prediction demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised approaches and competitiveness to some fully supervised methods. Key advantages are the multi-camera consistency and ability to reconstruct unobserved space. Limitations include inability to model scene dynamics or flow and reliance on pretrained segmentation model quality.
