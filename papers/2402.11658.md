# [Dynamic planning in hierarchical active inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of consensus on how to achieve dynamic planning (decision-making in changing environments) in active inference frameworks. State-of-the-art solutions couple active inference with traditional machine learning methods rather than exploiting its full theoretical potential.
- While some works prescribe combining discrete and continuous models, this "hybrid" approach has seen little practical implementation, especially in dynamic contexts. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores the under-investigated direction of hybrid computations in hierarchical active inference systems for dynamic planning.
- It analyzes design choices for goal-directed behavior in continuous models, including flexible intentions, hierarchical structures with intrinsic/extrinsic dynamics, and iterative transformations between reference frames.
- A "hybrid unit" is introduced that combines discrete hidden causes and continuous hidden states via Bayesian model reduction, enabling dynamic inference and intention selection.
- When coupled with a higher-level discrete model, this hybrid unit allows multi-step tasks through online action planning. 
- A "hierarchical hybrid model" is constructed with multiple hybrid units in a hierarchy, afforded advanced control like tool use by propagating signals between discrete and continuous domains.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a unified view connecting motor control and high-level behavioral studies in active inference.
- Compares several implementations for imposing and inferring dynamic trajectories in hierarchical settings. 
- Introduces flexible intentions, intrinsic/extrinsic factorization, and iterative transformations as useful representations.
- Describes a hybrid unit for dynamic inference via model reduction between discrete and continuous variables.
- Demonstrates a hierarchical hybrid model that achieves complex multi-step tasks like tool use through online replanning.
- Discusses open challenges and future directions at the intersection of hierarchy, dynamics, and structure learning.

In summary, the paper explores a novel direction of leveraging hierarchical hybrid models in active inference for advanced dynamic planning capabilities, with demonstrations on complex tool use tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores how to achieve dynamic planning and goal-directed behavior in changing environments through hierarchical hybrid models in active inference, with a focus on modeling tool use by combining discrete decision-making and continuous motor control.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is exploring the direction of combining discrete and continuous representations into a unified framework of active inference for achieving dynamic planning and goal-directed behavior. Specifically:

- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of different design choices for motor control and decision-making under active inference, with the goal of bringing these two areas closer. 

- It proposes flexible intentions in continuous models to achieve multi-step behavior by manipulating beliefs over environmental entities. Intentions emerge from combining simpler subgoals.

- It presents hierarchical architectures with intrinsic-extrinsic modules to capture the hierarchical causal relationships of the generative process and perform iterative transformations between reference frames.

- It introduces a hybrid unit with Bayesian model reduction between categorical hidden causes and continuous hidden states to enable dynamic inference and planning. This is integrated with a discrete model for replanning actions.

- It demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed approaches on a complex tool use task involving inference over affordances, coordination of multiple limbs, and remapping the body schema.

In summary, the main novelty is in exploring hierarchical hybrid models under active inference for dynamic planning, going beyond traditional hybrid architectures limited to static priors and environments. This opens an new direction toward achieving flexible goal-directed behavior.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts discussed in this paper include:

- Active inference - A theoretical framework that aims to explain perception, action, and learning in biological systems as an inferential process of minimizing prediction errors and surprise. 

- Free energy principle - The fundamental assumption behind active inference that organisms maintain homeostasis by restricting themselves to a limited set of states that are compatible with staying alive.

- Dynamic planning - The ability to infer and impose motor trajectories related to high-level cognitive goals and decisions, especially in changing environments.  

- Hierarchical models - Models composed of multiple layers or levels that aim to capture the hierarchical causal structure of the world and cognitive processes. 

- Hybrid models - Models that combine both discrete and continuous representations to leverage their complementary strengths.

- Flexible intentions - In the context of this paper, dynamically configurable attractor states that allow an agent to exhibit complex, multi-step behaviors in continuous state spaces. 

- Tool use - A complex real-world task requiring flexible planning, understanding affordances, and adapting body schema representations that the paper uses as motivation.

- Bayesian model reduction - A technique to constrain an infinite continuous space to a discrete set of hypotheses to enable planning and decision-making.
