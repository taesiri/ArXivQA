# [Dynamic planning in hierarchical active inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of consensus on how to achieve dynamic planning (decision-making in changing environments) in active inference frameworks. State-of-the-art solutions couple active inference with traditional machine learning methods rather than exploiting its full theoretical potential.
- While some works prescribe combining discrete and continuous models, this "hybrid" approach has seen little practical implementation, especially in dynamic contexts. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores the under-investigated direction of hybrid computations in hierarchical active inference systems for dynamic planning.
- It analyzes design choices for goal-directed behavior in continuous models, including flexible intentions, hierarchical structures with intrinsic/extrinsic dynamics, and iterative transformations between reference frames.
- A "hybrid unit" is introduced that combines discrete hidden causes and continuous hidden states via Bayesian model reduction, enabling dynamic inference and intention selection.
- When coupled with a higher-level discrete model, this hybrid unit allows multi-step tasks through online action planning. 
- A "hierarchical hybrid model" is constructed with multiple hybrid units in a hierarchy, afforded advanced control like tool use by propagating signals between discrete and continuous domains.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a unified view connecting motor control and high-level behavioral studies in active inference.
- Compares several implementations for imposing and inferring dynamic trajectories in hierarchical settings. 
- Introduces flexible intentions, intrinsic/extrinsic factorization, and iterative transformations as useful representations.
- Describes a hybrid unit for dynamic inference via model reduction between discrete and continuous variables.
- Demonstrates a hierarchical hybrid model that achieves complex multi-step tasks like tool use through online replanning.
- Discusses open challenges and future directions at the intersection of hierarchy, dynamics, and structure learning.

In summary, the paper explores a novel direction of leveraging hierarchical hybrid models in active inference for advanced dynamic planning capabilities, with demonstrations on complex tool use tasks.
