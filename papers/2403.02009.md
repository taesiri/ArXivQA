# [Topic Aware Probing: From Sentence Length Prediction to Idiom   Identification how reliant are Neural Language Models on Topic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a debate about whether transformer-based neural language models like BERT and RoBERTa rely primarily on word order/syntax or word co-occurrence/topic information when processing language. This has implications for understanding their strong performance on NLP tasks.

- It is unclear what type of information is encoded in different layers of BERT and RoBERTa's transformer architecture.

Methodology:
- The authors propose a novel "topic-aware probing" method to assess the reliance of models on topic information. This involves training probes on embeddings from one topic and testing on seen (same) and unseen topics. 

- They apply this method to a range of probing tasks, from simple (bigram shift) to complex (idiom identification). Bigram shift is insensitive to topic, while idiom ID requires both topic and non-topic (e.g. syntactic) information.

- GloVe embeddings are used as a primarily topic-based baseline, while a random embedding baseline controls for probe model capacity.

Key Findings:
- On the bigram shift task, small differences between seen and unseen topic performance indicate insensitivity to topic information. GloVe performs the same as random embeddings, supporting its use as a topic-only baseline.

- On idiom ID, large differences between seen and unseen scores confirm sensitivity to topic signals. GloVe outperforms random embeddings, indicating usefulness of topic information.  

- BERT and RoBERTa's middle layers improve over GloVe on most probing tasks, suggesting encoding of non-topic (potentially syntactic) signals. However, performance still correlates with topic-sensitivity, indicating a primary reliance on topic signals.

- Newer RoBERTa model seems more reliant on topic than BERT. Removal of BERT's next-sentence prediction objective may increase RoBERTa's focus on distributional semantics.

Main Contributions:
- Novel topic-aware probing method to assess contribution of topic signals
- Analysis showing idiom ID relies on both topic and non-topic signals
- Finding that Transformer models encode both types of signals but primarily rely on topic, especially for difficult tasks
- Suggesting addition of more syntactic signals could further improve transformer models


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel topic-aware probing methodology to analyze neural language models like BERT and RoBERTa and finds that although they encode both topic and non-topic linguistic information, their performance relies more strongly on the topic information captured through word co-occurrence statistics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes a novel probing methodology called "topic-aware probing" to assess the reliance of neural language models on topic information. This involves training and testing probes on embeddings from seen vs unseen topics.

2. It applies topic-aware probing to analyze the reliance on topic information for the task of general idiom token identification. The results indicate this task is quite sensitive to topic, and that BERT and RoBERTa rely heavily on topic information for idiom identification. 

3. More broadly, it analyzes the relationship between topic sensitivity and model performance across several probing tasks. The results suggest that tasks less sensitive to topic tend to be more difficult for BERT and RoBERTa, indicating these models rely heavily on topic information in general.  

4. The analysis finds RoBERTa relies more heavily on topic than BERT, likely due to differences in their pre-training objectives. This suggests directions for improving neural language models by better incorporating syntactic information.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel topic-aware probing methodology and analysis showing the heavy reliance of BERT and RoBERTa on topic information across a range of tasks. The results have implications for understanding these models and improving their linguistic capacities.

The paper proposes a novel "topic-aware probing" methodology to analyze the relative contribution of topic (word co-occurrence) information versus non-topic (e.g. syntactic) information to the performance of Transformer-based neural language models like BERT and RoBERTa. It applies this analysis across a range of probing tasks, with a particular focus on the task of idiom token identification. The results suggest these models rely primarily on topic information, and that their performance tends to decrease on tasks less sensitive to topic. The paper also finds differences in the reliance on topic information between BERT and RoBERTa, which it attributes to differences in their pre-training objectives.

In summary, the key terms cover the models analyzed, the information types compared, the tasks examined, and the novel methodology proposed. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel "topic-aware probing" method to assess the contribution of topic-based information to the performance of Transformer-based models. How exactly does this method work? What are the key steps involved? 

2. The paper evaluates the proposed method on two tasks - bigram shift and idiom token identification. Why were these specific tasks chosen? What are their key properties and how do they enable analyzing the role of topic information?

3. The paper argues that the bigram shift task is not sensitive to topic information while idiom token identification is. What evidence from the experimental results supports these claims?

4. The paper uses GloVe embeddings as a primarily topic-based baseline representation. What justification is provided for this? How do the GloVe results on bigram shift and idiom token identification align with or diverge from this assumption?

5. The paper finds that BERT's initial layer embeddings behave similarly to GloVe on certain tasks. What does this suggest about the information encoded in BERT's initial layers? How does this compare to RoBERTa?

6. The paper observes better performance of BERT and RoBERTa's deeper layers across tasks. What is the hypothesized cause of this improvement? What type of information do you think the deeper layers capture?

7. The paper argues that RoBERTa relies more heavily on topic information than BERT. What differences between the two models could account for this greater topic reliance in RoBERTa?

8. The paper proposes two metrics to quantify a task's sensitivity to topic information. What are these metrics? Are they correlated across tasks? What does this indicate?  

9. The paper finds probing tasks less sensitive to topic also tend to be more difficult for BERT and RoBERTa. What are the potential implications of this for NLP systems? How can this reliance on topic information be reduced?

10. The paper focuses only on English text and Transformer encoder architectures. How could the analysis be extended to study other languages and decoder architectures? Would we expect similar observations?
