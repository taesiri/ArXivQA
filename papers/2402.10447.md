# [Incremental Sequence Labeling: A Tale of Two Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Incremental Sequence Labeling: A Tale of Two Shifts":

Problem:
- Incremental sequence labeling involves continuously learning to recognize new entity classes over time while retaining knowledge of previous classes. 
- This leads to two key issues:
   1) E2O (entity to non-entity) shift: Model mislabels old entities as non-entities over time due to catastrophic forgetting.
   2) O2E (non-entity/old entity to new entity) shift: Model exhibits bias towards labeling data as new entities.
- Prior work has focused on E2O but neglected the O2E problem. Neglecting O2E causes bias towards new entities during training.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose framework called IS3 - Incremental Sequential Labeling without Semantic Shifts.
- Mitigate E2O via knowledge distillation to maintain model's discriminative ability for old entities. 
- Address O2E via:
   1) Debiased cross-entropy loss to reduce model's bias towards labeling data as new entities. 
   2) Prototype-based approach to balance contributions of old and new entities during training.
- Use class feature centers as prototypes to avoid storing samples directly.

Main Contributions:
- Identify and formally define the E2O and O2E shift problems in incremental sequence labeling.
- Propose comprehensive IS3 framework to address both E2O and O2E shifts.
- Introduce debiased loss and prototype learning methods to alleviate bias towards new entities.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets across various incremental settings.

In summary, the paper offers a new perspective on catastrophic forgetting in incremental sequence labeling by tackling the key issues of E2O and O2E semantic shifts. The proposed IS3 framework leverages knowledge distillation, debiased losses and prototype learning to effectively handle both challenges.
