# [Compositional Semantics for Probabilistic Programs with Exact   Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11351)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing compositional semantics for probabilistic programs with exact conditioning constructs. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a simple Gaussian programming language with a first-class exact conditioning construct. This allows expressing models like Gaussian processes and Kalman filters compositionally.

- To give denotational semantics, the paper defines a general construction Cond(C) which extends a Markov category C with a conditioning operator. This provides a categorical framework for reasoning about conditioning in a compositional way. 

- For the Gaussian language, semantics are given via Cond(Gauss) and shown to be fully abstract. This validates principles like commutativity and substitutivity of conditions.

- An equational theory is provided which completely axiomatizes equality of Gaussian programs. This is used to derive normal forms and establish uniqueness results.

In summary, the main contribution is using categorical semantics to model exact conditioning in a well-behaved compositional way. This provides foundations for probabilistic programming languages and statistical modelling based on conditioning. The Cond construction and Gaussian case study illustrate the general principles.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper defines a probabilistic programming language for Gaussian random variables with exact conditioning, gives operational, denotational and equational semantics for it, proves the semantics are consistent and fully abstract, and shows how to avoid paradoxes like Borel's paradox; it also introduces a general categorical construction called Cond that allows adding conditioning as a first-class construct while preserving good properties like commutativity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents compositional semantics for probabilistic programs with exact conditioning constructs. Here are some comparisons to related work:

- It builds on previous categorical semantics for probabilistic programming without conditioning, such as Markov categories. The key novelty is the Cond construction, which adds conditioning to a Markov category in a compositional way. 

- It is related to symbolic disintegration techniques developed by Shan and Ramsey, which transform programs with conditioning into equivalent programs without. This paper takes a more synthetic, axiomatic approach by making conditioning a first-class construct.

- The operational and denotational semantics connect to other semantic models for probabilistic programming like measure transformer semantics. The equational theory is similar to presentations of effectful computations.

- The programming language and Gaussian model are quite minimal, but this simplicity allows studying core issues around exact conditioning compositionally. More expressive probabilistic languages like WebPPL or Infer.NET incorporate both exact and soft conditioning.

- The categorical semantics relate to other uses of categories in probability theory, such as stochastic relations. The Cond construction is a new contribution for representing conditioning.

- The paradoxes around conditioning like Borel's paradox find a resolution using type-theoretic distinctions between equations and conditions. Other work has studied these paradoxes from a measure-theoretic perspective.

Overall, this paper carves out a new semantic foundation for exact conditioning in probabilistic programs. It connects to a variety of related work through its operational, denotational and equational semantics. The minimal Gaussian language serves as an insightful case study of compositional probabilistic modelling.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Studying a tighter class of "well-behaved disintegrations" to better characterize the type of disintegration performed by their symbolic disintegrator. The notion of continuous disintegrations is too restrictive, so more work is needed here. 

- Exploring the tradeoff between expressivity of probabilistic programming languages and well-behavedness of conditioning constructs. The more restricted Gaussian setting has nicer properties than general Borel probability. Studying Markov categories of varying degrees of specialization could help navigate this.

- Making connections between exact conditioning and logic programming ideas like unification. Bringing the semantics closer together and supporting both random and logic variables within a common framework is a challenge.

- Thinking of the "exists" quantifier in logic programming as an idealized "flat" prior distribution. This could create closer ties between probabilistic and logic programming semantically.

- Applying the categorical lens (e.g. lens or Oles constructions) to study Bayesian inversion or quantum theory. This could lead to fruitful generalizations or new insights.

- Exploring connections to presentations of linear relations using string diagrams. The syntactic presentation of the Gaussian language resembles this.

- Implementing the operational semantics and studying contextual equivalence empirically through testing.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: finding the right formal characterization of "well-behaved" conditioning; making connections to logic programming; and exploring applications of the categorical viewpoint. Implementation and experimentation is also mentioned.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a probabilistic programming language for Gaussian random variables with a first-class exact conditioning construct. It defines operational, denotational and equational semantics for the language and shows they are consistent. The denotational semantics uses a new construction called Cond that extends a Markov category with conditioning while preserving good categorical properties. The operational semantics models Gaussian sampling and exact inference. The equational theory provides a complete axiomatization and enables deriving normal forms. Through the consistency of the semantics, the paper establishes several desirable properties for exact conditioning, including substitutivity and commutativity. The framework generalizes beyond just Gaussians through the abstraction of Markov categories. Overall, the paper provides a categorical foundation for compositional probabilistic programming with exact conditioning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a probabilistic programming language for Gaussian random variables with exact conditioning, and provides operational, denotational, and equational semantics for it. The language has two main constructs - drawing a random variable from a Gaussian distribution, and conditioning on an equality between two expressions holding exactly. The operational semantics executes programs by maintaining a Gaussian distribution over allocated random variables, and conditioning statements update this distribution. 

The main contributions are denotational semantics based on the Cond construction, which extends a Markov category with conditioning effects, and an equational theory that completely axiomatizes the language. Key results show that the denotational semantics is fully abstract, the equational theory is consistent and proved complete for the unconditioned fragment, and normal forms are derived. Through these semantic analyses, the paper argues that the principles of compositionality and local reasoning hold for exact conditioning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents compositional semantics for a probabilistic programming language with exact conditioning constructs for Gaussian random variables. The main method is to define a categorical model called Cond that extends Markov categories with a notion of conditioning modeled as a morphism. This allows giving a denotational semantics to a Gaussian language with exact conditioning that satisfies good equational properties like commutativity of conditions. The construction is shown to not depend specifically on properties of Gaussians but rather follow from universal properties in the general framework of Markov categories. Overall, the Cond construction provides a principled and general way to compositionally interpret probabilistic programs with exact conditioning.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question of this paper seems to be: 

How to develop compositional semantics for probabilistic programming languages with exact conditioning constructs that allow conditioning on equality of continuous random variables?

The key points are:

- The paper focuses on probabilistic programming languages with "exact conditioning" constructs that allow conditioning a probabilistic model on equality of random variables, like x =:= y. This is in contrast to "soft conditioning" based on likelihoods.

- Exact conditioning on equality of continuous random variables is tricky because the exact value often has zero probability. This is known as Borel's paradox.

- The authors want to develop semantics that make exact conditioning compositional, well-behaved, and consistent. This involves developing operational, denotational, and equational semantics.

- They use a Gaussian language as a case study, but also aim to derive the good properties from universal categorical principles rather than Gaussian-specific reasoning.

So in summary, the central research question is how to develop different styles of semantic foundations for probabilistic programming languages with exact conditioning, in order to justify principles like compositionality and consistency.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper is addressing the problem of providing compositional semantics for probabilistic programming languages with exact conditioning constructs. Specifically, it focuses on developing semantics for a Gaussian programming language with exact conditioning that allows convenient properties like exchangeability of conditions and local reasoning.

The key points are:

- Exact conditioning (like x =:= y) is tricky in probabilistic programs because conditioning continuous random variables to be equal often has zero probability. This is known as Borel's paradox. 

- The paper presents operational, denotational, and equational semantics for a Gaussian language with exact conditioning. It shows these semantics validate principles like commutativity and substitutivity that make reasoning about programs with conditioning more compositional.

- To make the denotational semantics compositional, the paper introduces a categorical construction called Cond that extends a Markov category C to support conditioning as a morphism. This allows representing programs as pairs of a probabilistic computation and observations.

- The operational semantics is defined directly on the Gaussian language. The denotational semantics interprets programs in Cond(Gauss) and is shown to be fully abstract. The equational semantics provides an axiomatic presentation that is shown to be sound and complete.

- The paper argues these semantics are not specific to Gaussians but follow from general properties of Markov categories, thus providing foundations for exact conditioning in wider probabilistic programming settings.

In summary, the key contribution is using categorical semantics to provide a compositional treatment of exact conditioning in probabilistic programs. This helps address paradoxes like Borel's and enables local reasoning principles for languages with conditioning constructs.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents compositional semantics for exact conditioning in probabilistic programming languages, focusing on a Gaussian language as a case study. The authors introduce a minimalist Gaussian language with sampling from a standard normal distribution and exact conditioning. They provide operational, denotational, and axiomatic semantics for this language. To make the denotational semantics compositional, they introduce the Cond construction, which extends a Markov category to support conditioning as a first-class morphism. They apply Cond to the category of Gaussians to model their language, proving it is fully abstract. They also give an equational theory for the language, demonstrating principles like substitutivity and commutativity, and use it to derive normal forms. Overall, the paper establishes that exact conditioning can serve as a foundation for compositional statistical modelling. The semantics justify convenient equivalences like reordering conditions based on dataflow dependencies. The authors argue the principles extend beyond Gaussians by virtue of arising from universal properties. Thus probabilistic programming with exact conditioning can be made consistent while retaining significant expressive power.
