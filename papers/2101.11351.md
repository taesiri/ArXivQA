# [Compositional Semantics for Probabilistic Programs with Exact   Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11351)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is providing compositional semantics for probabilistic programs with exact conditioning constructs. Specifically:- The paper introduces a simple Gaussian programming language with a first-class exact conditioning construct. This allows expressing models like Gaussian processes and Kalman filters compositionally.- To give denotational semantics, the paper defines a general construction Cond(C) which extends a Markov category C with a conditioning operator. This provides a categorical framework for reasoning about conditioning in a compositional way. - For the Gaussian language, semantics are given via Cond(Gauss) and shown to be fully abstract. This validates principles like commutativity and substitutivity of conditions.- An equational theory is provided which completely axiomatizes equality of Gaussian programs. This is used to derive normal forms and establish uniqueness results.In summary, the main contribution is using categorical semantics to model exact conditioning in a well-behaved compositional way. This provides foundations for probabilistic programming languages and statistical modelling based on conditioning. The Cond construction and Gaussian case study illustrate the general principles.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper defines a probabilistic programming language for Gaussian random variables with exact conditioning, gives operational, denotational and equational semantics for it, proves the semantics are consistent and fully abstract, and shows how to avoid paradoxes like Borel's paradox; it also introduces a general categorical construction called Cond that allows adding conditioning as a first-class construct while preserving good properties like commutativity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents compositional semantics for probabilistic programs with exact conditioning constructs. Here are some comparisons to related work:- It builds on previous categorical semantics for probabilistic programming without conditioning, such as Markov categories. The key novelty is the Cond construction, which adds conditioning to a Markov category in a compositional way. - It is related to symbolic disintegration techniques developed by Shan and Ramsey, which transform programs with conditioning into equivalent programs without. This paper takes a more synthetic, axiomatic approach by making conditioning a first-class construct.- The operational and denotational semantics connect to other semantic models for probabilistic programming like measure transformer semantics. The equational theory is similar to presentations of effectful computations.- The programming language and Gaussian model are quite minimal, but this simplicity allows studying core issues around exact conditioning compositionally. More expressive probabilistic languages like WebPPL or Infer.NET incorporate both exact and soft conditioning.- The categorical semantics relate to other uses of categories in probability theory, such as stochastic relations. The Cond construction is a new contribution for representing conditioning.- The paradoxes around conditioning like Borel's paradox find a resolution using type-theoretic distinctions between equations and conditions. Other work has studied these paradoxes from a measure-theoretic perspective.Overall, this paper carves out a new semantic foundation for exact conditioning in probabilistic programs. It connects to a variety of related work through its operational, denotational and equational semantics. The minimal Gaussian language serves as an insightful case study of compositional probabilistic modelling.
