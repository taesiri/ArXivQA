# [MAP-Elites with Transverse Assessment for Multimodal Problems in   Creative Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating creative multimodal content (e.g. images and text) is challenging to evaluate automatically. Traditional quality-focused evolution leads to lack of diversity. Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites promote diversity but don't handle multimodal coherence well.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose MAP-Elites with Transverse Assessment (MEliTA), a variant of MAP-Elites tailored for multimodal creative tasks. 
- MEliTA decouples modalities and enables "cross-pollination" between elites by sharing partial solutions (single modalities) to form better cross-modal combinations.
- A "transverse assessment" process pairs a changed modality (image or text) of one elite with modalities of other elites to find a better fit.

Use Case and Experiments:
- As a testbed, MEliTA evolves: 1) game titles 2) short game descriptions 3) cover images for hypothetical games.
- Fitness is based on CLIP score between image and text. Behavior characterizations capture image properties and text topics.
- Results over 7 game titles show MEliTA finds fitter elites than MAP-Elites without transverse assessment. Diversity is comparable or better.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes MAP-Elites with Transverse Assessment (MEliTA) to improve multimodal coherence in QD search 
- Achieves fitter and more diverse multimodal content than baseline MAP-Elites
- Demonstrates a way to orchestrate multiple modalities (image, text generators) via quality diversity
- Lays algorithmic groundwork for more complex multimodal creative tasks

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative transverse assessment method to enhance creative co-evolution of multimodal content through quality diversity search. Experiments on generating game titles, descriptions and images showcase improvements over regular MAP-Elites.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes MAP-Elites with Transverse Assessment (MEliTA), a novel Quality Diversity algorithm that evolves coherent and diverse multimodal artefacts by assessing and sharing parts of solutions between individuals occupying similar niches in the feature map.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel algorithm called MAP-Elites with Transverse Assessment (MEliTA). Specifically:

- MEliTA is a variant of the MAP-Elites quality diversity algorithm that is tailored for multimodal creative tasks. It leverages deep learned models to assess coherence across modalities.

- MEliTA decouples the modalities of the evolved artefacts and promotes cross-pollination between elites by sharing partial artefacts (e.g. image or text) among phenotypically similar elites to find more coherent pairings. 

- They demonstrate MEliTA on a bimodal use case of generating fictional game titles, descriptions and cover images. Results show MEliTA can improve text-to-image mappings within the solution space compared to regular MAP-Elites.

- The paper states that their approach represents a significant step towards multimodal bottom-up orchestration and lays groundwork for coordinating multiple creative agents across modalities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel MEliTA algorithm for quality diversity search in multimodal creative tasks, along with a demonstration on generating coherent game text and images.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does MEliTA's transverse assessment approach for multimodal creative tasks differ from traditional approaches to Quality Diversity search like MAP-Elites? What novel capabilities does it introduce?

2. What assumptions does MEliTA make about the separability of modalities within a solution and the availability of modality-specific variation operators and behavior characterizations? How could these impact scaling MEliTA to problems with more modalities?  

3. How does MEliTA balance quality and diversity both within and across modalities? Does its transverse assessment tend to improve one more than the other?

4. What are some of the computational tradeoffs introduced by MEliTA's transverse assessment, in terms of additional fitness evaluations per generation? How might this impact problems where fitness is expensive to evaluate via simulation?

5. How sensitive is MEliTA to the choice of similarity metrics used for transverse assessment across modalities? Could poor metrics undermine the cross-pollination of elites it is designed to promote?  

6. How do the text and image variation operators impact phenotypic vs genotypic search? What are some pros and cons of MEliTA's phenotype-level operators in terms of diversity and noise?

7. How does constraining text generation to predefined topics impact the range of outputs produced by MEliTA? Could this overly narrow the creative space being explored? 

8. What quality controls are in place on the generator models to prevent issues like intellectual property concerns from real game studio names appearing in generated text?

9. How might MEliTA be extended to handle constraints on quality or feasibility better? Could concepts from constrained optimization or two-population approaches improve it?

10. How well would MEliTA generalize to other multimodal creative domains like generating stories, images and music/soundscapes? What new challenges might arise there?
