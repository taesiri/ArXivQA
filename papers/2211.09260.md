# [Task-aware Retrieval with Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09260)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop a general-purpose task-aware retrieval system that can follow human-written instructions to find relevant documents for a query?

More specifically, the key questions and goals addressed in this paper are:

- Can we formulate the retrieval problem in a way that explicitly models user intent by providing natural language instructions? The authors introduce "retrieval with instructions" as a new task formulation to achieve this.

- How can we create a large-scale benchmark dataset to facilitate research in retrieval with explicit instructions? The authors introduce BERRI, a diverse collection of ~40 retrieval datasets covering 10 domains, annotated with human-written instructions. 

- Can we train a single multi-task retriever that can follow instructions to perform well on diverse retrieval tasks with no parameter updates? The authors propose TART, trained on BERRI via multi-task instruction tuning, which advances SOTA on zero-shot retrieval benchmarks.

- How robust is the multi-task instructed retriever in a realistic cross-task pooled corpus setting? The authors introduce X2R, a new challenging evaluation that requires handling diverse intents and documents. TART outperforms baselines on X2R. 

Overall, the central goal is developing a general-purpose retrieval system that can leverage explicit instructions to align its behavior with user intent, instead of needing task-specific models or training. The key contributions are formulating this problem, creating resources to study it, and demonstrating initial success on benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new task formulation called "retrieval with instructions", where a natural language instruction is provided along with a query to explicitly describe the user's search intent. The paper introduces BERRI, a large-scale collection of retrieval datasets with expert-annotated instructions covering diverse domains and tasks. BERRI is used to train TART, a unified multi-task retrieval system that can follow instructions to perform different retrieval tasks without any parameter updates. TART models using dual-encoder and cross-encoder architectures are evaluated, with the cross-encoder model TART-full showing state-of-the-art performance on popular zero-shot retrieval benchmarks like BEIR and LOTTE. 

The paper also introduces a challenging new evaluation setup called X^2-Retrieval, which requires retrieving relevant documents from a large pooled corpus containing different domains and intents. In this setup, TART significantly outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its ability to leverage explicit textual instructions to find relevant documents in an open-domain corpus. 

Key factors contributing to TART's success include training on diverse datasets with informative instructions, using challenging negative samples that don't follow instructions, and scaling up the model. The paper lays the groundwork for building general-purpose, task-aware retrieval systems that can adapt via natural language instructions.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions:

- Improving efficiency of instruction-following retrievers. The paper notes that their bi-encoder model (TART-dual) showed some performance drop compared to its non-instruction-following counterpart. They hypothesize this is due to the smaller model capacity and limited query-document interactions. Future work could explore scaling up bi-encoder models or modeling architectures that enable rich interactions while maintaining efficiency.

- Further scaling up the number of training datasets. The paper shows benefits from training on a diverse set of 40+ datasets. But recent work on instruction tuning of large language models uses orders of magnitude more training data. Future work could collect more retrieval tasks and instructions to investigate if further scaling continues to improve zero-shot and cross-task retrieval.

- Exploring different instruction formats. The paper uses natural language instructions, but other formats like demonstrations or structured prompts could be explored. This may improve efficiency and flexibility.

- Studying social biases and failures in instruction-following. As models become more responsive to instructions, it will be important to understand potential issues with misleading, harmful, or biased instructions.

- Applications to other information retrieval settings like recommendation and question answering. The idea of guiding systems with explicit instructions could extend beyond document retrieval.

In summary, key future directions are improving efficiency, scaling up training data, exploring instruction formats, studying social impacts, and extending the approach to other IR tasks. But the paper lays important groundwork for building general-purpose, task-aware retrieval systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new task formulation called retrieval with instructions, where a search task instruction and query are provided as input to a retrieval system. The goal is to retrieve documents that are relevant to the query according to the instruction. This allows modeling users' intents explicitly and building general-purpose, task-aware retrieval systems. 

To enable research on this task, the authors create BERRI, a large-scale collection of around 40 retrieval datasets covering diverse domains, with expert annotations of instructions following a novel schema. BERRI is used to train TART, a multi-task retrieval system with two architectures: TART-dual using a dual encoder, and TART-full using a cross encoder to better model query-document interactions. Both are trained on BERRI in an end-to-end fashion using carefully designed negative samples, including a new type of instruction-unfollowing negatives.

TART achieves state-of-the-art results on popular zero-shot retrieval benchmarks BEIR and LOTTE, significantly outperforming larger models and task-specific retrievers. The authors also introduce a new challenging evaluation, X2R, that pools different tasks into a single corpus. TART outperforms baselines on this as well, demonstrating its ability to leverage explicit instructions to find relevant documents in a large open-domain corpus. Analyses show the benefits of instructions, data/model scale, and negative sampling strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new problem formulation called "retrieval with instructions", where explicit natural language instructions are provided along with a query to better capture the user's intent and information need. To enable research in this area, the authors create a large-scale benchmark called BERRI (Bank of Explicit RetrieveR Retrieval Instructions), consisting of ~40 retrieval datasets covering 10 diverse domains, with expert-written instructions following a novel schema. They use BERRI to train TART (Task-aware ReTrievers), which employs dual-encoder and cross-encoder architectures. TART achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR and LOTTE zero-shot retrieval benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior work including models 3x larger. The authors also introduce X2R, a challenging cross-task cross-domain evaluation, where TART outperforms baselines in finding relevant documents from a pooled corpus. Analysis shows that instructions, dataset diversity, model scale, and novel negative samples are key factors. The work lays the foundation for building general-purpose, task-aware retrievers that can leverage explicit textual intents. Key open questions include improving efficiency of instruction-following retrievers and further scaling up training data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new task called "retrieval with instructions" which aims to improve information retrieval systems by incorporating natural language instructions that specify the user's intent. This allows the system to retrieve documents that align with the explicit intent rather than relying only on the query. 

The authors create a new benchmark called BERRI which contains 40 retrieval datasets covering diverse domains, each annotated with multiple expert instructions. They use BERRI to train TART, a unified retriever that can perform well on new tasks in a zero-shot setting simply by providing it with a new instruction. Experiments show TART outperforms prior work on popular zero-shot retrieval benchmarks as well as on a new challenging cross-task evaluation. The analysis demonstrates the importance of comprehensive instructions, diversity in training data, model capacity, and carefully designed negative samples for successful multi-task instruction-based retrieval. The work lays the foundation for building more general purpose, task-aware retrieval systems.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper presents research on the problem of instruction-following for information retrieval. The key questions it addresses are:

1. How can we build retrieval systems that can follow natural language instructions to modify their search behavior and relevance measure? 

2. How can we leverage instruction tuning techniques from natural language processing to improve zero-shot transfer and cross-task generalization in retrieval models?

3. Can providing explicit instructions for search tasks help retrieval systems better capture diverse user intents compared to only using queries?

4. Does training on a large, diverse benchmark of retrieval tasks with human-annotated instructions enable models to adapt to new tasks at test time?

To address these questions, the paper introduces a new task formulation called "retrieval with instructions" where models are given an instruction that defines the search intent along with the query. It presents BERRI, a new large-scale dataset of retrieval tasks covering diverse domains and intents, each with multiple human-written instructions. 

The authors use BERRI to train TART, a unified multi-task retriever that can follow instructions to perform different retrieval tasks. Key findings are:

- TART achieves state-of-the-art results on zero-shot retrieval benchmarks like BEIR and LOTTE, outperforming larger models and task-specific systems.

- On a new cross-task benchmark X2R, TART outperforms baselines by leveraging instructions to handle queries with diverse intents.

- Analysis shows instructions, dataset diversity, model capacity and challenging negatives are crucial for instruction-following in retrieval.

In summary, this work demonstrates the promise of instruction tuning and explicit modeling of search intents to develop more general and task-aware retrieval systems. The introduction of BERRI could enable further research in this direction.
