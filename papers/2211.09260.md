# [Task-aware Retrieval with Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09260)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop a general-purpose task-aware retrieval system that can follow human-written instructions to find relevant documents for a query?More specifically, the key questions and goals addressed in this paper are:- Can we formulate the retrieval problem in a way that explicitly models user intent by providing natural language instructions? The authors introduce "retrieval with instructions" as a new task formulation to achieve this.- How can we create a large-scale benchmark dataset to facilitate research in retrieval with explicit instructions? The authors introduce BERRI, a diverse collection of ~40 retrieval datasets covering 10 domains, annotated with human-written instructions. - Can we train a single multi-task retriever that can follow instructions to perform well on diverse retrieval tasks with no parameter updates? The authors propose TART, trained on BERRI via multi-task instruction tuning, which advances SOTA on zero-shot retrieval benchmarks.- How robust is the multi-task instructed retriever in a realistic cross-task pooled corpus setting? The authors introduce X2R, a new challenging evaluation that requires handling diverse intents and documents. TART outperforms baselines on X2R. Overall, the central goal is developing a general-purpose retrieval system that can leverage explicit instructions to align its behavior with user intent, instead of needing task-specific models or training. The key contributions are formulating this problem, creating resources to study it, and demonstrating initial success on benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new task formulation called "retrieval with instructions", where a natural language instruction is provided along with a query to explicitly describe the user's search intent. The paper introduces BERRI, a large-scale collection of retrieval datasets with expert-annotated instructions covering diverse domains and tasks. BERRI is used to train TART, a unified multi-task retrieval system that can follow instructions to perform different retrieval tasks without any parameter updates. TART models using dual-encoder and cross-encoder architectures are evaluated, with the cross-encoder model TART-full showing state-of-the-art performance on popular zero-shot retrieval benchmarks like BEIR and LOTTE. The paper also introduces a challenging new evaluation setup called X^2-Retrieval, which requires retrieving relevant documents from a large pooled corpus containing different domains and intents. In this setup, TART significantly outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its ability to leverage explicit textual instructions to find relevant documents in an open-domain corpus. Key factors contributing to TART's success include training on diverse datasets with informative instructions, using challenging negative samples that don't follow instructions, and scaling up the model. The paper lays the groundwork for building general-purpose, task-aware retrieval systems that can adapt via natural language instructions.
