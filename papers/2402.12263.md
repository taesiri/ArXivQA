# [Towards a tailored mixed-precision sub-8bit quantization scheme for   Gated Recurrent Units using Genetic Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12263)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Deploying deep neural networks, especially recurrent ones like LSTMs and GRUs, on ultra low-power embedded devices is challenging due to their complexity and memory requirements. Specifically, the internal state in RNNs makes them difficult to effectively quantize to very low precisions like sub-8-bit. Existing quantization schemes for GRUs have not fully exploited the potential benefits of going below 8 bits.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel modular quantization scheme for GRUs where the bit-width of each operator (linear layers, additions, multiplications, activations) can be selected independently. This allows exploring a vast space of possible mixed-precision configurations. Genetic algorithms are then used to efficiently search this space and find Pareto optimal solutions that maximize accuracy while minimizing model size. 

Key Contributions:
- Designed a modular integer-only quantization scheme for GRUs enabling sub-8-bit computation
- Employed a multi-objective genetic algorithm to explore the large mixed-precision search space
- Evaluated the method on 4 diverse sequential tasks - row-wise MNIST, pixel-wise MNIST, keyword spotting with 4 and 10 keywords
- Demonstrated 25-55% model size reduction with comparable accuracy to the 8-bit baseline
- Showed that mixed-precision solutions dominated homogeneous ones in terms of Pareto efficiency
- Identified patterns in optimal solutions that suggest the need for bespoke quantization schemes

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in model compression by using genetic algorithms to automate the design of compact yet accurate mixed-precision quantized GRU models for deployment on embedded devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modular integer quantization scheme for GRUs where the bit width of each operator can be selected independently using genetic algorithms to simultaneously optimize for model accuracy and size.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors propose a modular integer quantization scheme for Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) where the bit width of each operator can be selected independently. They then employ Genetic Algorithms to efficiently explore the vast search space of possible bit widths, simultaneously optimizing for model accuracy and size. The solutions found using this method achieve better Pareto efficiency compared to homogeneous precision quantization baselines. Specifically, the authors demonstrate model size reductions between 25-55% while maintaining comparable or better accuracy to the 8-bit baseline on four different sequential classification tasks.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of genetic algorithms for mixed-precision quantization scheme search to optimize GRUs on multiple objectives including accuracy and model size. This allows them to find solutions that exceed the Pareto efficiency of homogeneous precision schemes.
