# [Tracking through Containers and Occluders in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03052)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: how capable are current computer vision systems at tracking objects through heavy occlusion and containment, and what progress needs to be made for them to attain a robust sense of object permanence like humans? Specifically, the paper introduces a new benchmark dataset and approach for evaluating and training neural network models on their ability to track objects that become occluded or contained inside other objects in videos. It compares two recent video transformer models on this challenging task and finds they can be surprisingly capable under certain conditions, but there still remains a considerable performance gap compared to human abilities for spatial reasoning about object permanence in complex realistic settings.The key research contributions appear to be:- Proposing a new comprehensive benchmark video dataset with dense annotations to support studying occlusion and containment events during object tracking.- Introducing a structured task and output representation for models to predict the target object, occluder, and container masks over time. - Evaluating recent state-of-the-art video transformers on this dataset and analyzing where they succeed and fail.- Identifying remaining challenges like handling nested or moving containers that future work should focus on to reach human-level visual reasoning for object permanence.In summary, the central research question is assessing and pushing towards closing the gap between current computer vision systems and humans in terms of reasoning about object persistence under occlusion or containment events in videos. The paper introduces a new benchmark and approach to support this investigation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a new task and dataset for evaluating object permanence capabilities of neural networks. The paper introduces the TCOW benchmark, which consists of both synthetic (Kubric) and real-world (Rubric) videos depicting objects undergoing occlusion and containment events. 2. Defining the task of not just tracking a target object, but also explicitly segmenting the occluder or container when the target becomes occluded or contained. This provides a more complete understanding of the target's situation.3. Evaluating two recent video transformer models (AOT and TimeSFormer) on this new benchmark. Through analysis, the paper shows these models can track objects reasonably well in certain settings, but there is still a considerable performance gap compared to human abilities in terms of robustly reasoning about object permanence.4. Providing thorough ablation studies to understand where the performance and generalization of the models come from. This suggests focusing on occluders/containers rather than precisely localizing invisible targets is often more effective.5. Releasing the novel benchmark to the community to facilitate further research on this challenging problem central to attaining strong spatial reasoning in computer vision.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new task formulation, dataset, and benchmark to push towards visual reasoning systems that have a proper sense of object permanence, which remains an open challenge for current methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces TCOW, a new benchmark and model for visual tracking of objects through heavy occlusion and containment, using both synthetic and real datasets to evaluate transformer-based video models on their ability to reason about object permanence.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on object permanence and visual tracking:- The focus on segmenting occluders/containers as well as the target object is novel. Most prior work has focused only on localizing the target object, even when occluded. Explicitly modeling the occluder/container helps better handle total occlusion.- The benchmark dataset includes a diverse mix of synthetic and real-world scenes exhibiting various challenging occlusion/containment scenarios. Many previous datasets for this problem have been limited to synthetic data or less complex real videos.- Quantitative evaluation goes beyond just target object tracking to also measure performance on occluder/container segmentation. This provides a more comprehensive assessment of models' object permanence capabilities.- The experiments compare recent state-of-the-art video transformers for this task. Most prior work evaluated simpler models like recurrent networks. The strong but imperfect performance of the transformers demonstrates this problem remains unsolved.- The paper analyses performance on different occlusion and containment types to identify key limitations like tracking through nested or moving containers. This points the way forward for future development.Overall, the unique focus on occluder/container segmentation, the diverse and challenging benchmark, and the experiments with modern video transformers help drive object permanence research forward compared to previous work. The paper's rigorous analysis also makes clearer how much progress is still needed in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more sophisticated tracking models that can better handle complex object interactions like nested containment, shuffling of identical containers, and occluder-occludee pairs that are visually similar. The authors note there is still significant room for improvement on these challenging scenarios compared to human capabilities.- Exploring different model architectures and training techniques to improve tracking through long-term occlusions. The context window used by current video transformer models may be too short to sufficiently capture object permanence. - Expanding the diversity, scale and realism of training datasets to cover more combinations of objects, backgrounds, occluder types, etc. More data could help improve sim2real transfer and make models more robust.- Studying how to integrate different sensory modalities beyond just RGB images, such as depth, audio, proprioception, etc. This could help resolve visual ambiguities.- Quantitatively evaluating and comparing different notions of "object permanence" to better understand models' capabilities. More diagnostic benchmark tasks could be designed.- Considering settings where the camera is moving instead of static, which increases the complexity of reasoning about occlusions and containment.- Exploring whether explicit 3D reasoning, physics-based simulation, or graphical scene representations could improve spatial understanding.In summary, the authors highlight the need for more advanced models and training procedures, larger and more realistic datasets, multi-sensory integration, diagnostic evaluation protocols, and exploration of explicit reasoning approaches to take object permanence capabilities to the next level.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces TCOW, a new benchmark and model for visual tracking of objects through heavy occlusion and containment. The authors propose a task where the goal is to segment both the projected extent of a target object as well as the surrounding container or occluder whenever one exists, given a video sequence. To study this, they create a dataset with synthetic and real-world annotated videos covering diverse forms of occlusion and containment.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new benchmark and model for visual tracking of objects through heavy occlusion and containment. They introduce a dataset of synthetic and real-world videos depicting objects undergoing various forms of occlusion and containment. The task is to segment the projected extent of a target object over time, as well as any surrounding container or occluder. To study this, they evaluate two recent transformer-based video models - Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) and a customized version of TimeSFormer. The TimeSFormer model is modified to output a triplet of masks at each timestep - one for the target object, one for the frontmost occluder, and one for the outermost container. Both models are trained on the synthetic data and evaluated on the real-world videos. Experiments show these models can track objects reasonably well under certain conditions but still struggle with more complex scenarios requiring stronger notions of object permanence, indicating room for improvement. Overall, the main contribution is the novel task and dataset for studying object permanence, along with benchmarking some initial neural network models on this challenge.
