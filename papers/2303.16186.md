# [Large-scale Training Data Search for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16186)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently search for an optimal training set from a large-scale data pool for object re-identification. Specifically, the paper aims to develop a method to select a subset of training data that maximizes re-ID accuracy on a target dataset under certain budget constraints. The key hypothesis is that searching for training data that minimizes the domain gap to the target dataset will improve re-ID performance. The main contributions of the paper are:1. Proposing a search and pruning (SnP) framework to efficiently construct a target-specific and budgeted training set for re-ID from a large source pool.2. Demonstrating the superiority of the constructed training set over random/greedy sampling and individual datasets in achieving higher re-ID accuracy. 3. Providing insights on the correlations between domain gap, number of identities/images, and re-ID performance through quantitative analysis.4. Discussing the specificity of the method to re-ID and its potential in bridging domain gaps.In summary, the paper develops a principled approach to search large-scale data to construct an optimal training set tailored to a re-ID target, in order to maximize accuracy under budget constraints. The key innovation is efficiently minimizing the domain gap through search and pruning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a search and pruning (SnP) solution to the training data search problem for object re-identification (re-ID). Specifically:- They introduce a search and pruning framework to efficiently sample a training set from a large-scale source pool for a target re-ID domain. This allows constructing a training set that is smaller but has higher quality compared to using the entire source pool.- They propose a two-stage approach: 1) In the search stage, they identify and merge clusters of source identities that exhibit similar distributions to the target domain. This results in a target-specific subset.2) In the pruning stage, they select representative identities and images from the search outputs to control the size of the resulting training set. This satisfies the budget constraint on training data size.- They demonstrate that the searched training sets achieve higher re-ID accuracy compared to random sampling, greedy sampling, and using individual source datasets. The training sets are also shown to be target-specific, improving performance on the given domain while weakening generalization ability.- The code is available to facilitate future research on this problem.In summary, the key contribution is developing a tailored training data search solution for object re-ID that constructs a high-quality and budget-aware training set from a large pool of source data. This helps train competitive re-ID models when target domain labels are unavailable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-step approach called Search and Pruning (SnP) to efficiently construct a target-specific training set for object re-identification by first identifying similar source subsets and then selecting representative identities and images under a budget constraint.
