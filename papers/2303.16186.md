# [Large-scale Training Data Search for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16186)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently search for an optimal training set from a large-scale data pool for object re-identification. Specifically, the paper aims to develop a method to select a subset of training data that maximizes re-ID accuracy on a target dataset under certain budget constraints. The key hypothesis is that searching for training data that minimizes the domain gap to the target dataset will improve re-ID performance. The main contributions of the paper are:1. Proposing a search and pruning (SnP) framework to efficiently construct a target-specific and budgeted training set for re-ID from a large source pool.2. Demonstrating the superiority of the constructed training set over random/greedy sampling and individual datasets in achieving higher re-ID accuracy. 3. Providing insights on the correlations between domain gap, number of identities/images, and re-ID performance through quantitative analysis.4. Discussing the specificity of the method to re-ID and its potential in bridging domain gaps.In summary, the paper develops a principled approach to search large-scale data to construct an optimal training set tailored to a re-ID target, in order to maximize accuracy under budget constraints. The key innovation is efficiently minimizing the domain gap through search and pruning.
