# [Deep Contrastive Multi-view Clustering under Semantic Feature Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05768)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing contrastive learning based multi-view clustering methods suffer from two issues: 1) False negative pairs in instance-level contrastive learning impair clustering performance. Treating non-positive instances as negative pairs leads to increasing feature discrepancy of instances with the same cluster label. 2) View-private noise in the fused view features interferes with contrastive learning. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a semantics-guided contrastive multi-view clustering framework (DCMCS) to address the above issues.

- View-specific features are extracted from each view and fused with weighted fusion to obtain common information while reducing view-private noise.  

- Semantics-guided instance-level contrastive learning is used where instance pair weights measured by semantic features are applied to reduce the impact of false negative pairs.

- Cluster-level contrastive learning aligns cluster assignment probabilities across views.

Main Contributions:
- Employ semantics-guided instance-level contrastive learning to alleviate the effect of false negative pairs via instance pair weights derived from semantic features.

- Concentrate on common information of the fused view when computing instance pair weights to relieve interference of view-private noise.

- Experiments on several datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed DCMCS framework in multi-view clustering. Effectiveness of instance pair weights and concentrating on fusion view's common information are analyzed.

In summary, the key ideas are using semantic guidance in instance-level contrastive learning and focusing on common information in the fused view to address issues with existing contrastive multi-view clustering methods. The framework achieves improved clustering performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a semantics-guided contrastive multi-view clustering framework that uses weighted fusion of view features, instance pair weights from semantic features to reduce false negatives, and focuses on common information to lessen interference of view-private information in improving clustering performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel semantics-guided contrastive multi-view clustering framework (DCMCS) to alleviate the impact of false negative pairs in instance-level contrastive learning. It uses instance pair weights obtained from semantic features to make the objective of contrastive learning consistent with the clustering objective and learn cluster-friendly features. 

2. It concentrates on the common information of the fusion view when calculating the instance pair weights. This relieves the interference of view-private information in the fusion view and achieves better clustering performance.

3. It combines instance-level and cluster-level contrastive learning objectives in the framework. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed instance pair weights and using fusion view's common information. The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a semantics-guided contrastive multi-view clustering framework to mitigate the issue of false negative pairs and view-private information interference. This is achieved by employing instance pair weights and focusing on fusion view's common information.
