# [Deep Contrastive Multi-view Clustering under Semantic Feature Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05768)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing contrastive learning based multi-view clustering methods suffer from two issues: 1) False negative pairs in instance-level contrastive learning impair clustering performance. Treating non-positive instances as negative pairs leads to increasing feature discrepancy of instances with the same cluster label. 2) View-private noise in the fused view features interferes with contrastive learning. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a semantics-guided contrastive multi-view clustering framework (DCMCS) to address the above issues.

- View-specific features are extracted from each view and fused with weighted fusion to obtain common information while reducing view-private noise.  

- Semantics-guided instance-level contrastive learning is used where instance pair weights measured by semantic features are applied to reduce the impact of false negative pairs.

- Cluster-level contrastive learning aligns cluster assignment probabilities across views.

Main Contributions:
- Employ semantics-guided instance-level contrastive learning to alleviate the effect of false negative pairs via instance pair weights derived from semantic features.

- Concentrate on common information of the fused view when computing instance pair weights to relieve interference of view-private noise.

- Experiments on several datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed DCMCS framework in multi-view clustering. Effectiveness of instance pair weights and concentrating on fusion view's common information are analyzed.

In summary, the key ideas are using semantic guidance in instance-level contrastive learning and focusing on common information in the fused view to address issues with existing contrastive multi-view clustering methods. The framework achieves improved clustering performance.
