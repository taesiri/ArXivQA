# [PAC Learnability under Explanation-Preserving Graph Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) are used to learn from graph-structured data, but lack interpretability. Recent works have proposed the notion of graph explanations, which are influential subgraphs for predicting the graph label.  

- This paper studies how to leverage such graph explanations to improve the sample complexity and accuracy of GNNs. Specifically, it considers two approaches: (1) explanation-assisted learning rules, and (2) explanation-assisted data augmentation.

Proposed Solutions:

1. Explanation-Assisted Learning Rules
- The paper proposes an explanation-assisted empirical risk minimization (EA-ERM) learning rule. This rule trains a GNN classifier on the original labeled graphs. During inference, if a test graph contains the explanation subgraph of any training graph, its label is directly predicted using that training label. Otherwise, the trained GNN classifier is used.

- It is proven that the sample complexity of EA-ERM can be arbitrarily smaller than standard ERM that does not use explanations. An example is provided where the standard VC dimension is infinite while the explanation-assisted VC dimension is 2.

2. Explanation-Assisted Data Augmentation
- The training set is enlarged by perturbing non-explanation edges of existing training graphs to produce new artificial graphs with the same explanations. 

- It is shown through an example that if the augmented graphs are not in-distribution, this approach can perform worse than standard ERM. The paper proposes methods to generate in-distribution augmentations.

Main Contributions:

- Formalized the problem of explanation-assisted graph learning and derived sample complexity of EA-ERM learning rules.

- Proved optimality of EA-ERM and showed its sample complexity can be arbitrarily smaller than standard ERM.

- Analyzed issues with explanation-assisted data augmentation. Showed performance depends on whether augmented graphs are in-distribution.

- Proposed implementable explanation-assisted GNN architectures based on the theoretical intuition.

- Provided comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets to demonstrate the benefits of explanation-assisted learning rules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces explanation-assisted graph neural network learning rules and data augmentation methods, analytically and empirically studies their sample complexity showing explanation-assisted learning can achieve lower sample complexity than standard methods but explanation-assisted data augmentation may worsen performance if it produces out-of-distribution samples, and proposes methods to leverage explanations at training time to improve efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Providing a rigorous formulation of the explanation-assisted graph learning problem and associated sample complexity.

2. Introducing the explanation-assisted empirical risk minimization (EA-ERM) learning rule, deriving its sample complexity, and proving its optimality. In particular, showing that the EA-ERM sample complexity can be arbitrarily smaller than the standard ERM sample complexity. 

3. Introducing explanation-assisted data augmentation mechanisms, and providing a theoretical justification that while in some cases it can improve performance, it can also lead to worse sample complexity compared to explanation-agnostic learning.

4. Providing an implementable class of explanation-assisted GNN mechanisms based on the theoretical analysis of EA-ERM. 

5. Empirical simulations verifying the improved performance of explanation-assisted GNN architectures when conditions from the theoretical analysis are satisfied, and diminished performance when those conditions are not met.

In summary, the main contribution is formalizing the problem of explanation-assisted graph learning, developing the EA-ERM learning rule, analyzing explanation-assisted data augmentation, proposing practical GNN methods, and empirical verification of the theory.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper introduces an explanation-assisted empirical risk minimization (EA-ERM) learning rule. Can you explain in detail how this learning rule utilizes the explanation subgraphs compared to a standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach? 

2) The paper shows that the sample complexity of EA-ERM can be arbitrarily smaller than that of ERM. Walk through the specifics of Example 1 which constructs a scenario demonstrating this.

3) Explain the two issues faced in directly implementing the proposed EA-ERM learning rule, and how the paper addresses these issues with the proposed explanation-assisted GNN architecture and training procedure.

4) The paper argues both theoretically and through an example that explanation-assisted data augmentation can sometimes improve performance but may also lead to worse sample complexity in certain cases. Explain when each of these scenarios may occur.  

5) Walk through the details of how the loss function in Equation 3 balances the classification loss on the original versus perturbed graphs and discuss how this addresses potential negative impacts of out-of-distribution augmentations.

6) Explain the difference between in-distribution and out-of-distribution graph augmentations. How does the paper's proposed perturbation function in Algorithm 2 aim to generate in-distribution perturbations?

7) Discuss the connections drawn in the paper between perturbation invariance in graph classification and other domains like image classification. How are these similarities leveraged in the graph explanation context?

8) Proposition 1 relates the perturbation invariance of a classification problem to its explainability parameters. Walk through the key steps in the proof of this result. 

9) The paper defines the explanation-assisted VC dimension $VC_{EA}$. Compare this to the standard VC dimension $VC$ - how can the former be much smaller as shown in Example 1?

10) Theorem 1 provides an upper bound on the sample complexity of explanation-assisted learning rules. Sketch the key elements of the proof and how conditioning on small empirical risk $err_O$ is used to derive the result.
