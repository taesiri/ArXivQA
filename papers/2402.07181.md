## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "3D Gaussian as a New Vision Era: A Survey":

Problem: 
3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a powerful technique for 3D rendering and scene representation. However, there lacks a comprehensive review and analysis of the field. Specifically, areas such as optimizing 3D-GS, key applications, challenges, and future directions warrant an in-depth survey.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a systematic survey categorizing existing 3D-GS literature based on optimization goals (efficiency, realism, cost, physics) and applications (reconstruction, manipulation, generation, perception, human-focused). A taxonomy is presented summarizing techniques and tasks. For each category, the paper offers fine-grained classification, comparisons, and concise summaries. 

Main Contributions:
- Unified framework with taxonomy categorizing 3D-GS works into optimization and application domains.
- Comprehensive, up-to-date review of classical and state-of-the-art 3D-GS approaches for each identified area.  
- Analysis of technical limitations of current research and insights into several promising future directions to inspire advances in this evolving field.
- Summarization of datasets commonly used for tasks like optimization, reconstruction, manipulation, and generation.
- Visual illustrations demonstrating the application of 3D-GS in areas like surface mesh extraction, text-guided manipulation, 3D object generation, and human body modeling.

In summary, this paper presents an extensive survey offering valuable organization and analysis of the 3D Gaussian Splatting field. The discussions on challenges and opportunities provide useful perspectives to spur future innovations in this domain.
