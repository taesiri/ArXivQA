# [Self-supervised Learning: Generative or Contrastive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08218)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the key frameworks, approaches, and objectives of recent self-supervised representation learning methods in natural language processing, computer vision, and graph learning?The authors aim to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of self-supervised learning techniques for representation learning in these domains. The paper categorizes the methods into three main types - generative, contrastive, and generative-contrastive (adversarial) - based on their underlying training objectives. It reviews important models and algorithms in each category, compares their pros and cons, and also discusses some theoretical insights and open problems. Overall, the main focus is to survey the current state-of-the-art in self-supervised representation learning across key AI domains.
