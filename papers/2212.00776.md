# [ResFormer: Scaling ViTs with Multi-Resolution Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00776)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we enable vision transformers (ViTs) to handle varying input resolutions effectively, so they can generalize well to resolutions not seen during training?

The key points are:

- ViTs currently suffer from poor resolution scalability - their performance drops significantly when evaluated on resolutions different from what they were trained on. 

- The paper proposes a framework called ResFormer to improve ViTs' ability to handle a wide range of resolutions.

- The main ideas are:
  - Train on multi-resolution images to model objects at different scales.
  - Use a scale consistency loss to share information across resolutions.
  - Introduce global-local positional embeddings that change smoothly across resolutions.

- Experiments validate ResFormer's ability to generalize to both lower and higher resolutions than seen during training. It significantly outperforms baseline ViTs like DeiT when evaluated on novel resolutions.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that training ViTs on multi-resolution images with scale consistency losses and adjustable positional embeddings will improve their generalization across a diverse range of input resolutions. The paper presents ResFormer as a method to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a vision transformer framework called ResFormer that achieves strong performance across a wide range of input image resolutions. The key ideas are:

- Multi-resolution training - The model is trained on images of multiple resolutions (e.g. 128, 160, 224) in each minibatch to improve generalization to different resolutions.

- Scale consistency loss - A knowledge distillation loss is applied between feature maps of different resolutions to encourage consistency and transfer knowledge from higher to lower resolutions.

- Global-local positional embeddings - A combination of global (absolute) and local (relative) positional embeddings is used to enable the model to smoothly adapt to different resolutions, especially novel unseen ones.

In experiments, ResFormer shows much better cross-resolution generalization ability compared to baseline DeiT models. For example, ResFormer-S achieves over 50% higher accuracy at low resolution 96x96 and over 5% higher at high resolution 640x640. The framework is also shown to be flexible, adapting well to semantic segmentation, object detection and video action recognition tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing techniques to make vision transformers more robust to varying input resolutions, an important capability for real-world applications. The results demonstrate ResFormer's excellent performance across a wide spectrum of resolutions compared to prior ViT models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes ResFormer, a vision transformer framework that trains on multi-resolution images and uses global-local positional embeddings to achieve strong performance on a wide range of input resolutions, including both smaller and larger resolutions than seen during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on improving the resolution scalability of vision transformers (ViTs), which is an important but understudied area. Many previous works have focused on scaling up ViTs to higher resolutions or reducing computation cost, but not on enabling ViTs to handle a wide range of resolutions. 

- The key idea of multi-resolution training and using global-local positional embeddings is novel for ViTs. Previous works have explored multi-scale training for CNNs, but adapting this idea to ViTs is non-trivial due to differences in architecture. The global-local positional embedding strategy is also unique.

- The experiments comprehensively evaluate performance over a wide spectrum of resolutions, from very low (96) to high (640). This shows the model's ability to generalize to unseen resolutions during inference. In contrast, most prior ViT papers only report 224 resolution results.

- For segmentation and detection tasks, the model achieves strong performance by simply using the ImageNet pre-trained model, without multi-resolution fine-tuning. This demonstrates the model has learned useful multi-scale representations. 

- Compared to concurrent works like Swin Transformers and Twins, this paper has a different focus on resolution scalability. But there are similarities in using local representations and relative position encoding. 

- For efficiency, the model achieves competitive trade-offs between accuracy and training time by reducing epochs. This is useful especially for multi-resolution training.

Overall, I think this paper makes important contributions in an relatively underexplored area. The core ideas and experiments around multi-resolution training and positional encodings help address resolution scalability for ViTs in a novel way compared to prior art. The comprehensive experiments and strong performance across tasks validate the usefulness of their approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring more advanced designs for global-local positional embeddings to further improve resolution scalability. The authors propose a simple global-local positional embedding strategy, but believe there is room for more sophisticated designs.

- Adapting ResFormer to more visual tasks beyond image classification, segmentation and detection evaluated in the paper. For example, extending it to other domains like medical imaging or aerial imagery.

- Designing specialized network architectures tailored for ResFormer's multi-resolution training. The paper uses a standard ViT architecture, but architectures optimized for multi-scale training could further improve performance.

- Studying how to efficiently schedule the sampling of different resolutions during multi-resolution training. The resolution schedule likely impacts model generalization, but this is not explored in depth.

- Applying ResFormer to video tasks using both spatial and temporal multi-resolution training. The authors show preliminary video results, but more extensive exploration of spatio-temporal multi-resolution training could be beneficial.

- Exploring semi-supervised or self-supervised pre-training with ResFormer to better leverage unlabelled data across resolutions.

- Analyzing ResFormer theoretically to better understand how multi-resolution training benefits generalization. This could guide architecture designs.

- Evaluating ResFormer on more diverse image resolutions and densities to test its limitations. The paper focuses on common resolutions, but evaluating extremely low/high resolutions could reveal areas for improvement.

In summary, the main suggested directions are around architecture designs, applications to more tasks, theoretical analysis, and evaluating the limits of ResFormer's resolution scalability. The multi-resolution training paradigm shows promise but there are many open questions to explore in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes ResFormer, a framework for improving vision transformers (ViTs) scalability towards different input resolutions. It trains ViTs with multi-resolution images and introduces a global-local positional embedding strategy to handle varying input sizes. Key ideas include:

1) Multi-resolution training: A given image is replicated to different resolutions during training. This helps the model learn features at different scales. 

2) Scale consistency loss: A distillation loss is applied between class tokens of different resolutions to enforce cross-scale feature consistency.

3) Global-local positional embeddings: A combination of global (sine-cosine) and local (convolution-based) positional embeddings that change smoothly across resolutions. This replaces standard positional embeddings that don't generalize well.

Experiments on ImageNet show ResFormer outperforms baseline ViTs significantly on a wide spectrum of unseen resolutions. It also transfers well to segmentation, detection and video tasks. Overall, ResFormer improves ViTs' resolution scalability through multi-resolution training and adaptive positional embeddings.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes ResFormer, a framework to improve the resolution scalability of vision transformers (ViTs). ViTs suffer performance drops when tested on resolutions different from training. ResFormer aims to improve ViT generalization to a wide range of resolutions, including unseen ones, through multi-resolution training. 

ResFormer takes multi-resolution image inputs during training. It enforces consistency between resolutions with a scale consistency loss to transfer knowledge from higher to lower resolutions. More importantly, it uses a global-local positional embedding strategy that changes smoothly across resolutions to facilitate training. Global positional embeddings provide spatial context while local ones are input-dependent to capture local patterns. Experiments on ImageNet show ResFormer outperforms vanilla ViTs significantly on a wide spectrum of resolutions. It also generalizes well to segmentation, detection and video tasks. Overall, ResFormer demonstrates promising resolution scalability and flexibility to adapt ViTs for different visual tasks needing varying input sizes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces ResFormer, a framework to scale vision transformers (ViTs) to handle varying input resolutions. The key ideas are:

1) Multi-resolution training: During training, each input image is resized to multiple resolutions (e.g. 128, 160, 224). The resulting multi-resolution images are fed into the ViT together in each training iteration to learn features from different scales. 

2) Scale consistency loss: A distillation loss is applied across different resolutions to transfer knowledge from higher to lower resolution features and improve performance.

3) Global-local positional embeddings: To enable smooth handling of varying resolutions, the positional embeddings are generated dynamically using both global (based on sine-cosine functions) and local (based on convolutional projections) components. This allows better generalization to unseen resolutions.

During inference, the model can take inputs of arbitrary resolutions and generate the positional embeddings accordingly without much performance drop. Experiments show ResFormer achieves significantly improved accuracy over vanilla ViTs when evaluated across a wide range of resolutions, especially for low resolutions. The framework is also shown to work for semantic segmentation, object detection and video action recognition.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The main problem this paper is addressing is improving the ability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to handle varying input resolutions. Specifically:

- ViTs currently suffer from poor performance when evaluated on input resolutions that differ from what they were trained on. Their performance drops significantly when tested on lower resolutions in particular.

- Multi-resolution training (training on images of different resolutions) is a promising way to improve generalization to different resolutions, but it is challenging to adapt this approach from CNNs to ViTs.

- Simply interpolating the positional embeddings of ViTs to novel resolutions at test time performs poorly. The positional embeddings need to change smoothly across resolutions to facilitate multi-resolution training.

- Images at different resolutions contain objects at different scales, so it's beneficial to enable information flow across the resolutions during training.

To address these issues, the paper proposes ResFormer, a ViT framework for multi-resolution training. The key ideas are:

- During training, replicate input images to different resolutions and train on all scales jointly.

- Use a scale consistency loss to distill knowledge from higher to lower resolutions. 

- Introduce global-local positional embeddings that can adapt smoothly to different resolutions.

- At test time, dynamically generate positional embeddings conditioned on the input resolution.

In summary, the paper aims to improve ViTs' ability to generalize to a wide range of input resolutions, including unfamiliar resolutions not seen during training. This is accomplished through multi-resolution training and novel positional embedding strategies.
