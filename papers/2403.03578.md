# [Causal Disentanglement for Regulating Social Influence Bias in Social   Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Social recommendation systems face the issue of social influence bias, which leads to over-recommending items that a user's friends have interacted with. This bias arises because under the influence of friends, users may make choices that deviate from their personal preferences. Existing methods to address this issue often completely eliminate social influence bias. However, the authors argue that not all social influence bias is detrimental - some recommendations from friends may actually align with the user's interests. Thus, blindly removing this bias could undermine potential positive effects and diminish recommendation accuracy. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a causal disentanglement-based framework called CDRSB to effectively regulate (rather than fully eliminate) social influence bias in social recommendations. The key ideas are:

(1) Identify two paths causing social influence bias: 
(i) non-causal social influence path: friends' recommendations bias a user's preferences 
(ii) causal interest path: the user's genuine interests  

(2) Disentangle user and item embeddings into interest embeddings (representing real preferences) and social influence embeddings (representing bias)

(3) Introduce a regulatory decoder to dynamically measure social influence and fuse interest + appropriately weighted social influence embeddings to generate final user and item representations.

Main Contributions:

- Identify and formally define the non-causal and causal paths causing social influence bias based on causal graphs

- Propose a disentangled encoder to decompose user and item embeddings into interest and social influence embeddings  

- Design mutual information minimization objectives to reduce redundancy between disentangled components

- Introduce regulatory decoder to effectively regulate rather than fully eliminate social influence bias

- Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate CDRSB's superiority over state-of-the-art methods

The key insight is that by distinguishing and appropriately fusing interest and social influence factors, positive effects of friends' recommendations can be retained while negative conformity bias can be mitigated. This allows CDRSB to enhance recommendation accuracy.
