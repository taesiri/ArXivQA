# [Visual Correspondence Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09711v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:

1) Can we derive a network architecture able to learn to hallucinate correspondences between images? 

2) Is correspondence hallucination beneficial for absolute pose estimation from images?

The key hypothesis appears to be that training a network to hallucinate correspondences, including for points that are occluded or out of view, could allow it to learn geometric reasoning and be more robust for tasks like pose estimation. 

The authors propose an architecture called NeurHal that takes two partially overlapping images and a set of points in one image, and outputs a probability distribution over where each point's correspondence lies in the second image. This allows the network to predict correspondences even for points that are occluded or outside the field of view in the second image.

The main novel contributions seem to be:

- Analyzing the specific challenges of learning to hallucinate correspondences compared to traditional feature matching.

- Proposing the NeurHal architecture to address these challenges.

- Demonstrating experimentally that NeurHal can hallucinate correspondences, even on novel scenes.

- Showing that correspondence hallucination improves robustness for absolute pose estimation, especially in cases with low image overlap where many points are occluded or out of view.

So in summary, the main research questions revolve around developing and evaluating an architecture for correspondence hallucination, with the central hypothesis that this will enable more geometrically robust matching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing the novel task of learning to hallucinate (predict) visual correspondences between image pairs, including when the correspondent is occluded or outside the field of view. This is in contrast to prior work on visual correspondence which focuses on identifying correspondences in overlapping regions. 

2. Developing a network architecture called NeurHal to tackle correspondence hallucination. Key aspects of NeurHal include using a non-siamese architecture and outputting a probability distribution over possible correspondent locations. The loss function and architecture are designed to handle identifying, inpainting, and outpainting correspondences in a unified manner.

3. Experimentally demonstrating NeurHal's ability to hallucinate correspondences, including generalizing to unseen indoor and outdoor scenes. Qualitative and quantitative results on ScanNet and MegaDepth show it can produce reasonable probability distributions for correspondences.

4. Showing that correspondence hallucination, especially outpainting, can improve the robustness of absolute camera pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art feature matching methods. NeurHal significantly outperforms competitors on low-overlap image pairs where outpainting is most beneficial.

5. Providing analysis and experiments highlighting that inpainting correspondences is a more difficult task than outpainting them.

6. Demonstrating the importance of using an appropriate pose estimation method that leverages the probabilistic correspondence maps produced by NeurHal.

In summary, the main novelty is introducing correspondence hallucination as a task, developing a method to tackle it, and showing its benefits for pose estimation robustness. The analysis and experiments also provide insights into this new problem.
