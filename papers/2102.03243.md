# [Hyperspherical embedding for novel class classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03243)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is:How can the normalized softmax loss function be leveraged for novel class classification in the open set problem, and does it offer advantages over common metric learning approaches that require pairwise training?The paper proposes using the normalized softmax loss (NSL) for novel class classification by adding a new neuron to the output layer of a trained network and inferring the weights between that neuron and the penultimate layer. This allows new classes to be classified without retraining the full network. The central hypothesis seems to be that the NSL approach will enable more effective and scalable novel class classification compared to metric learning approaches like triplet loss and contrastive loss that require computationally expensive pairwise training. The paper hypotomizes the NSL will achieve better accuracy by exploiting the cosine similarity properties it enforces on the latent space.In summary, the key research question is whether the proposed NSL approach can outperform current metric learning techniques on novel class classification, while also being more efficient and scalable by avoiding pairwise training. The experiments aim to validate if the NSL approach lives up to that potential.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for classifying new classes (the open set problem) using a normalized softmax loss approach, without requiring pairwise learning like other metric learning methods. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Leveraging the normalized softmax loss (NSL) for the open set problem. The NSL enforces a cosine similarity metric in the latent space. - Presenting a way to infer weights to connect a new neuron to the penultimate layer of a trained network, to classify new classes using few labeled examples. This avoids fine-tuning the full network.- Comparing the proposed NSL approach to metric learning methods like triplet loss and contrastive loss on image datasets. The results show NSL achieves superior accuracy while being more scalable as it doesn't require pairwise training.- Evaluating the method on a real-world plant species dataset, showing it can work for more complex and imbalanced data.- Comparing to incremental learning approaches and showing the inferred weights are competitive, especially in low shot scenarios.In summary, the key novelty is using NSL for the open set problem to classify new classes without pairwise training, and showing strong empirical results versus other metric learning methods. The method seems promising for handling new classes in large and complex datasets.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of novel class classification:- The main contribution of this paper is using the normalized softmax loss (NSL) for novel class classification without requiring pairwise training data. This differs from many other metric learning approaches like triplet loss, contrastive loss, etc. which rely on pairwise/triplet training examples. Avoiding pairwise training helps with scalability.- The authors compare NSL to triplet loss and contrastive loss on several datasets like CIFAR and Fashion MNIST. NSL consistently outperforms the other methods, especially as the number of novel classes increases. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach.- Using NSL allows inferring weights for new classes by simply averaging the feature vectors of examples from that class. This is much simpler than incremental learning approaches that require optimizing on new class samples while freezing other weights. - For multiple novel classes, the paper shows their weight inference procedure still provides a good approximation to fully optimizing the weights. This makes it efficient while retaining solid performance.- They provide a real-world demonstration on the PlantNet dataset which has many classes but imbalanced data. This shows the utility of their method for long-tailed, real datasets where adding new classes incrementally is valuable.- The comparison to incremental learning in a few-shot scenario is interesting. For up to 5 novel classes, their inferred weights approach matches optimization, indicating NSL can be a good weight initialization.Overall, the paper does a nice job benchmarking against existing techniques and demonstrating advantages of using NSL for this task. The efficiency and scalability improvements are noteworthy compared to metric learning approaches. The experiments on real and simulated datasets analyze the tradeoffs thoroughly.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper "Hyperspherical Embedding for Novel Class Classification" suggests several potential future research directions:1. Evaluating the approach on larger and more complex datasets, especially real-world datasets like Pl@ntnet which have uneven class distributions and varying data quality. The authors tested their method on relatively small image datasets like CIFAR and Fashion MNIST, so scaling up to larger datasets would be an important next step.2. Comparing to more incremental learning methods, especially in few-shot scenarios. The paper includes some comparisons to incremental learning but more work could be done here.3. Exploring modifications and extensions to the normalized softmax loss approach, such as dealing with more than one new class at a time. The authors' theoretical analysis focused on adding a single new class - extending this to multiple new classes could improve performance.4. Combining the NSL approach with generative models like GANs to generate synthetic data for novel classes when real data is limited. 5. Applying the approach to other domains beyond image classification, such as audio, video, text, etc. Since the technique relies mainly on modifying the softmax output layer it could generalize across data modalities.6. Exploring the use of different inference strategies besides just averaging the feature vector representations, which could lead to better estimation of weights for novel classes.7. Analysis of the theoretical properties of the NSL latent space and formal guarantees on its ability to generalize to new classes compared to other metric learning techniques.In summary, the main future directions are applying it to larger real-world datasets, combining it with generative models or other techniques for low-data scenarios, extending it to handle multiple novel classes, and theoretically analyzing its properties compared to other metric learning methods. Evaluating it on non-image data is also suggested.
