# [Gaze Embeddings for Zero-Shot Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09309)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can human gaze data be used as auxiliary information for zero-shot image classification? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Human gaze contains discriminative information about object classes, even for fine-grained classification tasks. 

2) Gaze data collected from non-expert users can provide a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes for zero-shot learning.

3) Encoding human gaze data into class-discriminative representations and using it alongside image features in a structured joint embedding model can improve zero-shot image classification performance.

In summary, the central goal of the paper is to demonstrate that human gaze can be a useful source of auxiliary information for zero-shot learning, overcoming some limitations of attributes or other alternatives like text corpora. The authors design gaze embedding methods to extract discriminative representations from gaze data, and perform experiments on fine-grained classification datasets to evaluate whether gaze-based zero-shot learning can work well in practice.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the use of human gaze data as auxiliary information for zero-shot image classification. Specifically:

- They present a new data collection paradigm that involves a discrimination task to increase the information content obtained from gaze data. 

- They propose three novel gaze embeddings to extract discriminative descriptors from the gaze data: Gaze Histograms (GH), Gaze Features with Grid (GFG), and Gaze Features with Sequence (GFS).

- They introduce two new gaze-annotated datasets for fine-grained image classification and show that human gaze data is class-discriminative, provides a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes, and improves zero-shot image classification performance. 

Overall, the key novelty is using human gaze as auxiliary information for zero-shot learning, where previous works relied on expert-provided attributes or other sources of text data. The proposed gaze embeddings aim to capture class-discriminative information purely from human gaze patterns on images. Their experiments demonstrate the viability of this approach on fine-grained classification datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in zero-shot learning:

- It proposes a new form of auxiliary information for zero-shot learning - human gaze data. Most prior work has used attributes annotated by domain experts or semantic embeddings from text corpora. Using human gaze is a novel and promising direction.

- It presents an extensive empirical evaluation on fine-grained classification tasks like bird and dog species recognition. The results demonstrate that human gaze can encode fine-grained visual differences between classes and competes with expert annotated attributes.

- The proposed gaze embeddings like Gaze Histograms, Gaze Features with Grid, and Gaze Features with Sequence are new techniques to encode discriminative information from gaze data. 

- The gaze data collection paradigm of comparing two class examples before a binary decision is designed to elicit more discriminative gaze from non-experts. This is a simple but clever idea.

- The paper doesn't achieve state-of-the-art results compared to the latest advances in zero-shot learning. But it presents a compelling new direction and evaluation of human gaze for this task.

Overall, this paper breaks new ground by exploring human gaze for zero-shot learning. It provides extensive analysis and demonstrates promising results. The idea of leveraging implicit human visual discrimination abilities via gaze is intriguing and merits further investigation in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring alternative data collection paradigms that allow annotators to view super-species as well as sub-species when collecting gaze data. The authors note that their results on larger fine-grained datasets like CUB-VWSW might benefit from this.

- Improving the zero-shot learning model itself to better take into account hierarchical relationships between classes. The authors suspect this could lead to better results.

- Fine-tuning the parameters of the gaze embedding methods, which the authors intentionally avoided in this work, in order to potentially further improve results.

- Investigating gaze behavior when observers are asked to focus on differences between two fine-grained images, rather than the current paradigm of comparing two classes. 

- Applying the gaze-based approach to other fine-grained classification domains beyond birds and pets.

- Collecting gaze data from true domain experts on birds and evaluating if this further improves the discriminative power compared to non-expert gaze.

- Exploring other uses of gaze embeddings as auxiliary information for tasks like weakly supervised localization or segmentation.

In summary, the main directions are: exploring alternative gaze data collection paradigms, improving the integration of hierarchical class relationships, tuning parameters for gaze embeddings, investigating comparative gaze on fine-grained image pairs, applying the method to new domains, collecting expert gaze data, and investigating novel tasks that could benefit from gaze embeddings as auxiliary input.

The paper proposes using human gaze data as auxiliary information for zero-shot image classification. The authors present a new data collection paradigm that involves showing users pairs of images from different classes and having them make binary decisions, which helps extract more discriminative gaze data.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a method for zero-shot image classification using human gaze data as auxiliary information. The key idea is that humans have a natural ability to discriminate between objects from different classes based on visual appearance. The authors propose a novel data collection paradigm where participants first inspect pairs of images from two different classes, and are then asked to classify a new image as belonging to one of those classes. Their gaze is recorded during this process. Three different gaze embeddings are proposed to encode the gaze data: Gaze Histograms (GH), Gaze Features with Grid (GFG), and Gaze Features with Sequence (GFS). These gaze embeddings are combined with image features in a structured joint embedding framework for zero-shot learning. 

The authors present new fine-grained gaze datasets based on subsets of CUB and Oxford Pets. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate that human gaze is class-discriminative and the proposed gaze embeddings provide a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes for zero-shot learning. The gaze embeddings outperform baselines using image saliency, random points, bubbles (mouse clicks), and Wikipedia text. Qualitative results illustrate the discriminative areas focused on by human gaze. Overall, this work shows that implicitly collected human gaze data can serve as effective auxiliary information for zero-shot image classification.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using human gaze data as auxiliary information for zero-shot image classification. The authors present a data collection paradigm that involves showing participants two example images from different classes, followed by an image from one of those classes that the participant must classify. This encourages participants to focus on the most discriminative parts of objects. Three novel gaze embeddings are proposed: Gaze Histograms (GH) which encode spatial layout, Gaze Features with Grid (GFG) which add location, duration, sequence, and concentration features, and Gaze Features with Sequence (GFS) which sample sequential gaze features. These gaze embeddings are combined with deep image features in a structured joint embedding framework. Experiments on fine-grained bird and dog/cat datasets show that human gaze data is class-discriminative, provides a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes, and improves zero-shot classification over other baselines. The results demonstrate that human gaze can be used as auxiliary information for zero-shot learning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of zero-shot image classification, where the goal is to classify images into classes that were not seen during training. The key challenge is that with no training examples for the unseen classes, it is difficult to learn an effective classifier. 

The main question the paper is asking is: can human gaze data be used as an alternative source of auxiliary information to help with zero-shot classification, instead of relying on expert-annotated attributes or other manually compiled sources?

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposing to use human gaze tracking data as the auxiliary information for zero-shot learning, exploiting people's natural ability to distinguish between objects/classes by just looking at them.

- Presenting a new data collection paradigm to obtain more useful gaze data by having people first compare example images from two classes and then classify a new image.

- Introducing three different ways to encode the gaze data into class-discriminative descriptors/embeddings: Gaze Histograms, Gaze Features with Grid, and Gaze Features with Sequence.

- Providing new gaze-annotated datasets based on CUB and Oxford Pets images for fine-grained classification.

- Showing through experiments that the proposed gaze embeddings can effectively support zero-shot classification and provide a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes.

In summary, the key idea is to use human gaze as the auxiliary information for zero-shot learning, instead of relying on manual attribute annotations or other data sources. The experiments demonstrate this is a promising approach.
