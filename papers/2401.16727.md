Solution:
- This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of hate speech detection, explanation and mitigation techniques across textual, visual, auditory and multimodal contexts.

- It highlights the critical role of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) in advancing hate speech moderation capabilities to handle the subtlety and complexity of modern online hate.

Key Contributions:
- Thorough categorization and discussion of datasets, tasks and unique challenges pertaining to text, image, video and audio-based hate speech

- Review of state-of-the-art techniques utilizing LLMs and LMMs to detect, explain and counter multimodal hate speech

- Analysis of limitations around model biases, generalizability and ethical concerns

- Exploration of future opportunities to enhance contextual understanding in models, enable cross-modality transfer learning, generate accurate explanations from models, and promote responsible AI governance

In summary, this is a comprehensive survey offering novel perspectives to inspire more nuanced, inclusive and ethical advancements in multimodal hate speech moderation through large language and multimodal models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper discusses using large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) for hate speech moderation. What are some of the key challenges and limitations faced when using these models for this task? How can these challenges be mitigated?

2. The paper highlights cross-modality transfer learning as a useful paradigm for hate speech detection. What are some of the gaps that need to be addressed when applying cross-modality transfer, such as semantic gaps and domain gaps? How can techniques like contrastive learning and domain adversarial networks help bridge these gaps?

3. For hate speech explanation, the paper notes the risk of "hallucinations" and factual inaccuracies when using large generative models. What methods can be used to ground or verify the factual correctness of explanations from these models? How can we enhance relevance while mitigating misinformation?

4. What are some of the unique challenges posed by video-based and audio-based hate speech compared to text-based modalities? Why are these areas still emergent fields with significant room for innovation in detection methodologies?  

5. The paper discusses emerging problem contexts like the metaverse. What modifications need to be made to existing hate speech detection approaches to adapt them to novel environments like the metaverse? What new strategies might need to be developed?

6. What are some examples of bias that can manifest in hate speech detection models? How do techniques like post-hoc explanations, Bayesian optimization, and conditional adversarial networks help mitigate bias while preserving performance?

7. For counter speech, what methods can generative models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 provide in aiding the annotation and development of datasets? What unique affordances do they offer over human annotation alone?  

8. What are some ways contextualization poses challenges for hate speech detection and mitigation? Why is nuanced understanding of language usage and context so difficult for automated systems?

9. How do factors like data complexity, quality, and sourcing introduce complications for processing multimedia hate speech data? What steps can be taken to address these complexities? 

10. What innovations are still needed to improve generalization of hate speech detection across different domains? Why does performance often degrade significantly during domain shift, and how can models be made more content/domain agnostic?
