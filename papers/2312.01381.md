# [Language-driven All-in-one Adverse Weather Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01381)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Language-driven All-in-one Adverse Weather Removal":

Problem:
- Images captured under adverse weather conditions like rain, snow, haze suffer from unpleasant degradations. This poses challenges for computer vision systems requiring high quality images.  
- Existing methods either handle each weather condition independently or use a single network for all conditions. But they have limitations:
    1) Rely on extra supervision signals like weather types which are unknown in real applications.  
    2) Use fixed network structures which limit learning diverse weather-specific information.
    3) Cannot handle varying severity levels or unseen weather conditions.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a Language-driven Restoration (LDR) framework to remove various adverse weather degradations in an all-in-one solution without needing extra supervision.

Key Ideas:
1) Leverage vision-language (PVL) models to reason about type and severity of degradations from the image, generating rich textual description as degradation prior.

2) Use the degradation prior to guide selection of restoration experts from a candidate list, enabling dynamic computation graphs based on weather condition.

3) Propose 3 modules:
   - Degradation Map Measurement: Get 2D degradation map by aligning textual prior with image features.
   - Top-K Expert Restoration: Select top experts using degradation map to get intermediate restored features. 
   - Restoration Feature Aggregation: Aggregate features using degradation map to improve locality.

Main Contributions:
- Novel way to leverage PVL models to extract rich, diverse weather-specific knowledge as textual degradation prior.
- Adaptive restoration approach via dynamic selection of experts guided by degradation prior.
- State-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with various weather conditions.

The summary covers the key problems, proposed solutions, modules, and main contributions of the paper in a detailed way for easy human understanding. Please let me know if any part needs to be expanded or clarified.
