# [3D Point Cloud Compression with Recurrent Neural Network and Image   Compression Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11680)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Storing and transmitting LiDAR point cloud data is essential for many autonomous vehicle (AV) applications like training data collection, remote control, cloud services, SLAM, etc. 
- However, due to the sparsity and unordered structure of point cloud data, it is difficult to compress it to a low volume. This causes issues like high transmission latency and large storage requirements.

Proposed Solution:
- Transform the raw point cloud into a combination of dense 2D matrix representations - range image, azimuth image and intensity image.
- Preprocess these representations to align pixels, calibrate data, and denoise images. 
- Compress these representations using common image compression methods like JPEG 2000 and a self-supervised deep compression model based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
- Reconstruct the original point cloud losslessly from the compressed representations.

Main Contributions:
- Novel calibrated and lossless projection of a point cloud into range, azimuth and intensity image representations.
- Compression of these representations with image compression methods and a RNN-based deep compression approach.  
- Introduces a new metric to evaluate intensity compression performance.
- Achieves better compression performance than comparable methods that use generic octree compression or raw point cloud compression.
- Provides source code and dataset to reproduce the results.

In summary, the paper proposes a method to transform the unstructured point cloud into structured 2D representations that can leverage spatial correlations to enable better compression performance using standard image compression techniques. The calibrated projection and deep compression model allows lossless reconstruction of the original point cloud from the compressed representations.
