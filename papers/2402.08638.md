# [SemRel2024: A Collection of Semantic Textual Relatedness Datasets for 14   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of semantic textual relatedness (STR) datasets, especially for non-English and low-resource languages. Most prior work has focused on semantic textual similarity (STS) for English.
- Existing STR/STS datasets for non-high resource languages are limited to word or phrase pairs rather than sentence pairs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors curate 14 new monolingual STR datasets annotated by native speakers, covering sentences pairs in Afrikaans, Amharic, Arabic (3 variants), English, Spanish, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Punjabi and Telugu.
- The datasets originate from 5 distinct language families, mostly spoken in Africa and Asia.
- Sentence pairs were extracted from diverse sources like news, Wikipedia, social media etc. and paired using heuristics like lexical overlap, contiguity and random selection.
- Annotations were obtained using Best-Worst Scaling by native speakers to generate fine-grained relatedness scores between 0 and 1.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark for semantic relatedness in several low-resource African and Asian languages across 5 families.
- Discussion of data collection and annotation challenges for low-resource languages. 
- Public release of the 14 datasets to promote research in semantic relatedness and representation learning for multiple languages.
- Reported baseline experiments in supervised, unsupervised and cross-lingual settings to demonstrate usefulness of the datasets.

In summary, the paper introduces much-needed semantic relatedness datasets for low-resource languages to enable further research in this area.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting the first benchmark on semantic distance (similarity or relatedness) that includes low-resource African and Asian languages from five different language families, such as Hausa, Amharic, Indonesian, Marathi, Telugu, Moroccan and Algerian Arabic.

2. Discussing general and language-specific challenges related to the data collection and annotation of the SemRel datasets. 

3. Presenting baseline experiments conducted in different monolingual and crosslingual settings to demonstrate the usefulness and potential of the dataset collection.

So in summary, the main contribution is creating and releasing new semantic textual relatedness datasets for 14 languages, many of which are low-resource languages, along with discussing the challenges faced and demonstrating the utility of the datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Semantic textual relatedness (STR) - The paper focuses on building datasets to capture the degree to which two linguistic units (sentences) are close in meaning.

- Low-resource languages - The datasets cover 14 languages, many of which are low-resource and predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia. These include Afrikaans, Amharic, Hausa, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, etc.  

- Sentence pairs - The SemRel datasets consist of sentence pairs, each assigned a relatedness score between 0 and 1 by native speakers.

- Comparative annotation - The relatedness scores were obtained using Best-Worst Scaling, where annotators compare and rank different pairs of sentences. 

- Language families - The 14 languages originate from 5 distinct language families: Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Niger-Congo, Dravidian, and Creole.

- Experiments - The paper reports supervised, unsupervised, and cross-lingual experiments using sentence embeddings like LaBSE and encoder-based models to demonstrate the dataset's utility.

- Multilinguality - One goal is promoting multilingual research by releasing datasets covering multiple languages, especially African and Asian ones with limited NLP resources.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper uses Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) for annotation. Can you explain in detail how the BWS annotation process works and why it was chosen over other annotation methods? 

2. The paper mentions using several heuristics like lexical overlap, contiguity, paraphrases etc for pairing sentences. Can you elaborate on each of these heuristics and how they help in creating a diverse dataset with varying degrees of relatedness?

3. The authors have created datasets for a wide range of low resource languages. Can you summarize their data collection process for 2-3 of the lower resource languages in the paper and the challenges faced? 

4. The annotation guidelines mention considering the closest meanings when sentences have multiple interpretations. How does one determine the "closest meaning" objectively during annotation? Does this process introduce any subjectivity or biases?

5. The paper reports high split-half reliability (SHR) scores. Explain how SHR is calculated and why a high SHR indicates reliable annotations.

6. The authors have made the full 4-tuple annotations public. What additional insights can be gained about disagreements between annotators from studying the full 4-tuple annotations? How can this be useful?

7. Three experimental settings are discussed - supervised, unsupervised and cross-lingual. Can you summarize the key results for each setting? Are there any interesting inferences you can draw regarding model performance across languages/settings?

8. For the unsupervised setting, language specific models like AmRoBERTa are reported. How do these compare against multilingual models like mBERT? When is using a language specific model beneficial?

9. The paper identifies some annotation challenges like code switching, topic familiarity affecting annotations etc. How do you think these challenges can be addressed?

10. The paper releases multiple datasets annotated by native speakers. What are some interesting research problems that these datasets can help explore apart from evaluating sentence representations?


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Unable to provide a one-sentence summary as the paper presents a multi-faceted contribution: it introduces SemRel, a collection of 14 new monolingual semantic textual relatedness datasets for low-resource languages, describes the data collection and annotation methodology, reports inter-annotator agreement scores, discusses challenges, and presents baseline experiments in supervised, unsupervised and cross-lingual settings.
