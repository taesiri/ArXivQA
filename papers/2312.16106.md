# [Clique Analysis and Bypassing in Continuous-Time Conflict-Based Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16106)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the multi-agent pathfinding problem with continuous time and costs (MAPF-R). Compared to classic MAPF which uses unit-cost actions on grids, MAPF-R allows agents to have variable-duration actions on general graphs. This is important for many real-world applications but makes the problem harder to solve optimally. A key challenge is resolving "conflict symmetries" which require searching many alternate paths to prove optimality, causing exponential complexity. 

Methods:
The paper focuses on improving Continuous-time Conflict-Based Search (CCBS), the state-of-the-art optimal MAPF-R solver. Three enhancements are proposed:

1) Bypass: Adapts a known CBS enhancement to skip subtree searches when alternate optimal paths are found. This helps resolve cost symmetries.

2) Biclique Constraints (BC): Discovers and enforces sets of spatially disjunctive constraints using bipartite conflict analysis. Helps resolve spatial conflicts.

3) Disjoint K-Partite Cliques (DK): Combines BC with disjoint splitting to break conflict symmetries across multiple agents. Further reduces subtrees searched.

The methods are evaluated on all standard MAPF benchmarks and on roadmaps ranging from sparse to super-dense.

Contributions:  
- First study of bypassing and biclique constraints for CCBS
- New formulations of BC and DK tailored for continuous time problems
- Empirical study showing BP handles cost symmetries, DK handles spatial conflicts, and combining them gives statistically significant runtime improvements.
- Enables solving optimally for 10-20% more agents on various graphs by reducing conflict symmetries.

The enhancements are general and complementary. Bypassing helps in cost-symmetric graphs while biclique constraints help in dense graphs. Together they significantly improve state-of-the-art across diverse benchmarks.
