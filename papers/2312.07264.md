# [Dual Structure-Preserving Image Filterings for Semi-supervised Medical   Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to improve segmentation accuracy by using a small labeled dataset along with a large unlabeled dataset. Most existing methods enforce prediction consistency between image variations or model variations on the unlabeled data. However, they do not effectively utilize structural information in medical images. Moreover, there is a confirmation bias issue where models can overfit to incorrect pseudo-labels on unlabeled data.

Method:
This paper proposes a novel dual structure-preserving image filtering (DSPIF) method to generate image variations while preserving topological structure. It builds a Max-tree and Min-tree to represent the image based on threshold decomposition. Then it removes nodes in these trees with no siblings, preserving only topologically critical components. This results in two filtered images (called USPIF and LSPIF) with different appearances but the same topological structure. 

Further, the contrast-invariance property of Max/Min-trees is leveraged - monotonic contrast changes before filtering lead to larger appearance diversity while still preserving structure.

The DSPIF image variations are applied in a mutual supervision framework (using CPS or MC-Net) for semi-supervised segmentation. It helps avoid confirmation bias and overfitting to incorrect pseudo-labels.

Contributions:
1) Proposes novel DSPIF method to generate image variations preserving topological structure
2) Leverages contrast-invariance of Max/Min-trees for more variation
3) Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods on 3 benchmark datasets
4) Using 20% labels achieves âˆ¼99.5% performance of full supervision
5) Helps alleviate confirmation bias issue in semi-supervised segmentation
