# [Dual Structure-Preserving Image Filterings for Semi-supervised Medical   Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07264)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation called dual structure-preserving image filterings (DSPIF). The key idea is to leverage the contrast-invariant Max-tree and Min-tree image representations to generate two filtered images that have different appearances but preserve the same topological structure as the original image. These dual filtered images are then used to enforce consistency between two segmentation networks in a mutual supervision framework as a way to take advantage of unlabeled data. Specifically, the paper introduces a new type of connected filtering on the Max/Min-trees that removes nodes having no siblings, preserving only topologically critical structure. To further increase diversity, monotonically increasing contrast transformations like gamma correction are applied before filtering. Experiments on three medical imaging datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with the proposed DSPIF approach significantly improving consistency regularization baselines like CPS and MC-Net. Using only 20% labeled data, DSPIF achieves âˆ¼99.5% of the full supervision performance. The main innovations are exploiting Max/Min-tree topology for structural consistency and the mutually reinforcing use of contrast-invariant filtering and contrast enhancement for diversity.
