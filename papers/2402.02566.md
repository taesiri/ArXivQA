# [STAGE: Scalable and Traversability-Aware Graph based Exploration Planner   for Dynamically Varying Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Exploration and mapping of large-scale subterranean environments like underground tunnels and caves is challenging for autonomous robots due to complex topology, degraded perception, and potential for dynamic changes (e.g. rockfalls blocking pathways). 
- Existing exploration methods using frontiers or random sampling don't scale well or adapt to changes.
- Efficient global repositioning/homing is needed when robots reach dead-ends but global paths may become invalid if environment changes.

Proposed Solution:
- Novel two-layered graph representation for exploration: 
   - Local sub-graphs generated rapidly around robot by detecting frontiers (unexplored areas) in visible point cloud. Used for fast traversal to nearby high information gain locations.
   - Global graph built by efficiently stitching local sub-graphs, enabling longer-range planning and homing while minimizing computations.
- Path segments checked for traversability before execution to handle environment changes. Untraversable segments trigger local replanning or global graph updates.

Main Contributions:
- Rapid local exploration adapting bounds and goals based on visibility and frontiers in point cloud
- Scalable global exploration reusing local sub-graphs to minimize computations
- Handling of environment changes through incremental assessment of path segments with replanning
- Demonstrated efficiency and adaptability in simulations and real-world tests with aerial and legged robots

In summary, the paper presents a novel exploration approach designed specifically for complex and dynamic subterranean environments, with innovations in representation, planning efficiency, and uncertainty handling that enable highly scalable and resilient autonomous exploration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable graph-based navigation framework with local sub-graphs for efficient exploration and a global graph layer that can adaptively update to handle dynamic changes in the environment during global repositioning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel navigation framework called STAGE (Scalable and Traversability-Aware Graph based Exploration Planner) for efficient large-scale exploration in environments that can have dynamic changes. The key aspects of the STAGE planner include:

1) A two layered graph representation - local sub-graphs for rapid exploration towards local frontiers based on direct pointcloud visibility, and a global graph built efficiently by re-using and stitching together sequential sub-graphs. This allows scalable and memory efficient exploration.

2) Traversability awareness and adaptive re-planning - It can handle changes in the environment like blocked paths by updating the global graph's traversability and replanning alternate routes. This allows the robot to continue exploration instead of getting stuck. 

3) Evaluation in both simulations and real-world experiments with aerial and legged robots, showing improved exploration metrics and computational efficiency compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel navigation framework for efficient and adaptive autonomous exploration in large-scale and dynamically changing environments, enabled by the two-layered graph representation and traversability aware replanning capabilities.

The paper proposes a novel navigation framework called STAGE (Scalable and Traversability-Aware Graph based Exploration Planner) that uses a two layered graph representation to enable efficient exploration in large-scale environments, while also being able to handle dynamic changes in the environment. Key aspects include local sub-graphs for rapid exploration towards frontiers, a global graph built from sub-graph overlap, and traversability awareness to adaptively update the global graph when changes occur that block previously traversable paths. The method is evaluated in simulation and on real legged robots.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-layered graph representation for exploration consisting of local sub-graphs and a global graph. What is the motivation behind having two separate graph layers instead of a single exploration graph? How do the local and global graphs interact?

2. The local sub-graphs are built using direct point cloud visibility to detect frontiers. How does direct visibility aid in rapid local exploration compared to other frontier detection methods? What are the challenges in using direct visibility? 

3. The global graph is constructed by re-using previous sub-graphs and only checking for collisions in the overlapping regions. Explain this process in detail and why it leads to computational savings over rebuilding the global graph from scratch each time.

4. Path planning happens at both the local sub-graph level and global graph level. What are the differences in how paths are planned and chosen at each of these levels? Why is having two path planners important?

5. Explain the concept of "oriented sampling space" and how it is used to detect and adapt to changes in the global map during global repositioning. How does this allow the method to be "traversability-aware"?

6. When an obstruction is discovered in the global path during repositioning, describe the process of re-routing including updating the global graph. Why is removing and recomputing edges necessary?

7. The global path is divided into segments before execution and checked for traversability. What is the motivation behind segmenting the path instead of following it blindly?

8. What specifically does the "semantic traversability image" encode and how is it used to refine the execution of individual path segments?

9. Compare and contrast the exploration strategy of the proposed method versus traditional frontier-based and sampling-based approaches. What are the key differences that make this method advantageous?

10. The method has been evaluated both in simulation and on a real legged robot. Describe these experiments and what aspects of the methodâ€™s performance they demonstrate. What were the key results?
