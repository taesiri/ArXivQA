# [STAGE: Scalable and Traversability-Aware Graph based Exploration Planner   for Dynamically Varying Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Exploration and mapping of large-scale subterranean environments like underground tunnels and caves is challenging for autonomous robots due to complex topology, degraded perception, and potential for dynamic changes (e.g. rockfalls blocking pathways). 
- Existing exploration methods using frontiers or random sampling don't scale well or adapt to changes.
- Efficient global repositioning/homing is needed when robots reach dead-ends but global paths may become invalid if environment changes.

Proposed Solution:
- Novel two-layered graph representation for exploration: 
   - Local sub-graphs generated rapidly around robot by detecting frontiers (unexplored areas) in visible point cloud. Used for fast traversal to nearby high information gain locations.
   - Global graph built by efficiently stitching local sub-graphs, enabling longer-range planning and homing while minimizing computations.
- Path segments checked for traversability before execution to handle environment changes. Untraversable segments trigger local replanning or global graph updates.

Main Contributions:
- Rapid local exploration adapting bounds and goals based on visibility and frontiers in point cloud
- Scalable global exploration reusing local sub-graphs to minimize computations
- Handling of environment changes through incremental assessment of path segments with replanning
- Demonstrated efficiency and adaptability in simulations and real-world tests with aerial and legged robots

In summary, the paper presents a novel exploration approach designed specifically for complex and dynamic subterranean environments, with innovations in representation, planning efficiency, and uncertainty handling that enable highly scalable and resilient autonomous exploration.
