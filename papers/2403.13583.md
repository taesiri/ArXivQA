# [CONLINE: Complex Code Generation and Refinement with Online Searching   and Correctness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating complex, real-world code is challenging for LLMs due to intricate structures, subtle bugs, advanced data types, and lack of supplementary content like test cases.

Proposed Solution: 
- The CONLINE framework that enhances code generation by incorporating:
  1) Online search to retrieve relevant information
  2) Automated correctness testing for iterative refinement
  3) Serialization of complex inputs/outputs
  4) Generation of test cases

Main Contributions:
- Online search with query planning to find code patterns and documentation
- Correctness testing using both output results and errors for refinement
- Serialization to simplify intricate inputs/outputs like matrices/images
- Automated test case generation to enable refinement

- Evaluated on complex datasets DS-1000 and ClassEval, CONLINE improves SOTA by 10.9% on DS-1000 and 9.47% on ClassEval
- Ablations validate benefits of each component
- Analysis shows CONLINE relies on model capabilities like planning and in-context learning

In summary, CONLINE advances complex code generation by imitating human practices of searching online and testing code iteratively. Its techniques to handle real-world complexity demonstrate potential to enhance reliability and practicality of LLMs for generating intricate code.
