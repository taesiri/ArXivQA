# [Can GPT-4 Perform Neural Architecture Search?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10970)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:Can GPT-4 perform neural architecture search to design high-performance neural network models, without requiring much domain expertise or specialized tuning?The key hypothesis is that by encoding the neural architecture search problem into a natural language prompt, GPT-4's generative capabilities can be leveraged as a general purpose black-box optimizer to efficiently search the space of architectures and identify promising candidates.The authors test this hypothesis by proposing an approach called GENIUS that iteratively prompts GPT-4 to suggest architecture designs, evaluates the accuracy of these designs empirically, and provides the results back to GPT-4 to further refine the architectures. The main goal appears to be assessing whether GPT-4, with minimal input apart from a natural language problem statement, can effectively tackle the challenging architecture search task and discover architectures that are competitive or superior to existing hand-designed and automatically searched architectures.In summary, the central research question is about evaluating GPT-4's potential as an off-the-shelf tool to assist research on complex technical problems, with neural architecture search serving as a case study. The key hypothesis is that the model has sufficient knowledge and optimization capabilities to find high-quality solutions with limited human guidance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:- The paper presents GPT-4 Enhanced Neural Architecture Search (GENIUS), a new NAS approach that uses GPT-4 as a black-box optimiser to search the space of neural network architectures. This is a novel and interesting idea compared to most existing NAS methods that rely on gradient-based optimization, evolutionary algorithms, or reinforcement learning. Using a large language model like GPT-4 for architecture search is a promising new direction.- Most prior NAS research has focused on developing specialized search algorithms and training strategies to make the search more efficient. In contrast, GENIUS relies solely on the capabilities of GPT-4 to explore the search space, without any explicit search algorithm. This makes GENIUS very simple to implement. However, the search efficiency may be lower than specially designed NAS algorithms.- The paper evaluates GENIUS on several standard NAS benchmarks like NAS-Bench-201, as well as a large-scale search space based on MobileNetV2 on ImageNet. The results are competitive with state-of-the-art NAS methods. This demonstrates the potential of using large LMs for architecture search, though further refinements may be needed to match or exceed the performance of leading algorithms.- The paper does not aim to achieve state-of-the-art results, but rather showcase the promise of leveraging general-purpose LMs like GPT-4 for technical research with minimal domain expertise. In this regard, GENIUS represents an exciting new direction for using AI to assist human research.- Most NAS papers focus on pushing the state-of-the-art performance, but give little consideration to broader impacts of automating architecture design. A key distinction of this work is its discussion of limitations and implications for AI safety when using black-box optimisers like GPT-4.Overall, GENIUS introduces a simple but novel approach of utilizing large language models for neural architecture search. The results are promising and highlight the potential of GPT-4 as a general research assistant. More work is needed to improve the efficiency and performance of this approach, but the paper makes an important contribution in exploring this new research direction and analyzing its societal impacts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring different search spaces and architecture designs beyond convolutional neural networks. The authors mainly focus on CNNs in this work, but note that GPT-4's generative capabilities could likely be applied to search spaces involving other architecture types like transformers.- Scaling up the search to larger datasets and models. The authors demonstrate results on smaller datasets like CIFAR and modestly-sized ImageNet models. Applying GENIUS to search spaces for models like EfficientNet trained on full-size ImageNet could further validate its capabilities.- Studying prompt engineering to better control and understand GPT-4's search behavior. The authors note GPT-4's response variability and lack of transparency into how prompt changes influence its suggestions. Future work on prompt engineering could provide more insight.- Constructing private benchmarks to avoid potential training data contamination. Since GPT-4 may have seen the public benchmarks during pre-training, using private benchmarks would ensure a fair search from scratch.- Exploring ensemble methods that combine GENIUS with other search techniques like evolutionary methods or Bayesian optimization. Ensemble approaches could potentially combine the strengths of different methods.- Developing rigorous theory and formal guarantees around language model-based architecture search. While empirical results are promising, developing theoretical grounding could further validate this direction.- Comparing against other large language models beyond GPT-4 as they become available. Assessing models like GPT-5 could provide insights into how capabilities evolve.- Investigating performance on tasks requiring architectures specialized to a data distribution vs. general-purpose architectures. This could reveal strengths/weaknesses.Overall, the authors lay out an extensive set of promising research directions to build on their preliminary results and further assess the potential of large language models for automated architecture search.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes GENIUS, a novel neural architecture search (NAS) approach that uses GPT-4 as a black-box optimiser to efficiently search the space of neural network architectures. The key idea is to encode the NAS problem into a natural language prompt that GPT-4 can parse. GPT-4 then responds with a proposed model configuration aimed at maximising the specified performance objective. Through an iterative process of evaluating the proposed models and providing feedback, GPT-4 gradually refines the architecture. Experiments across several NAS benchmarks demonstrate that GENIUS can identify highly performant architectures competitive with state-of-the-art NAS techniques, despite requiring little NAS-specific expertise. The authors argue this highlights GPT-4's potential as a versatile research tool, while also noting important limitations around reproducibility, benchmark contamination, and model inscrutability. They suggest the capability to perform architecture search raises potential AI safety concerns around accelerated capability gain. Overall, the work provides preliminary evidence that large language models like GPT-4 could serve as general optimisers to assist research, but caution and further study is warranted.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents GENIUS, a novel neural architecture search (NAS) approach that uses the large language model GPT-4 as a black-box optimiser to search the space of neural network architectures. GENIUS operates iteratively - first encoding the NAS problem statement into natural language that GPT-4 can parse. GPT-4 then responds with a proposed neural network architecture aiming to maximize specified performance objectives like accuracy. This architecture is evaluated empirically on the task of interest, and the results are provided back to GPT-4 as feedback to prompt it to propose an improved architecture in the next iteration. By using GPT-4's generative capabilities, GENIUS is able to quickly navigate the complex architecture search space and converge on high-performing configurations with minimal need for specialized NAS algorithms or human expertise. The authors demonstrate GENIUS on several image classification benchmarks, comparing it to state-of-the-art NAS techniques and human-designed networks to highlight its effectiveness as an architecture search method.
