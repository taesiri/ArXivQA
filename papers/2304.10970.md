# Can GPT-4 Perform Neural Architecture Search?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:Can GPT-4 perform neural architecture search to design high-performance neural network models, without requiring much domain expertise or specialized tuning?The key hypothesis is that by encoding the neural architecture search problem into a natural language prompt, GPT-4's generative capabilities can be leveraged as a general purpose black-box optimizer to efficiently search the space of architectures and identify promising candidates.The authors test this hypothesis by proposing an approach called GENIUS that iteratively prompts GPT-4 to suggest architecture designs, evaluates the accuracy of these designs empirically, and provides the results back to GPT-4 to further refine the architectures. The main goal appears to be assessing whether GPT-4, with minimal input apart from a natural language problem statement, can effectively tackle the challenging architecture search task and discover architectures that are competitive or superior to existing hand-designed and automatically searched architectures.In summary, the central research question is about evaluating GPT-4's potential as an off-the-shelf tool to assist research on complex technical problems, with neural architecture search serving as a case study. The key hypothesis is that the model has sufficient knowledge and optimization capabilities to find high-quality solutions with limited human guidance.
