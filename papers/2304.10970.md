# Can GPT-4 Perform Neural Architecture Search?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:Can GPT-4 perform neural architecture search to design high-performance neural network models, without requiring much domain expertise or specialized tuning?The key hypothesis is that by encoding the neural architecture search problem into a natural language prompt, GPT-4's generative capabilities can be leveraged as a general purpose black-box optimizer to efficiently search the space of architectures and identify promising candidates.The authors test this hypothesis by proposing an approach called GENIUS that iteratively prompts GPT-4 to suggest architecture designs, evaluates the accuracy of these designs empirically, and provides the results back to GPT-4 to further refine the architectures. The main goal appears to be assessing whether GPT-4, with minimal input apart from a natural language problem statement, can effectively tackle the challenging architecture search task and discover architectures that are competitive or superior to existing hand-designed and automatically searched architectures.In summary, the central research question is about evaluating GPT-4's potential as an off-the-shelf tool to assist research on complex technical problems, with neural architecture search serving as a case study. The key hypothesis is that the model has sufficient knowledge and optimization capabilities to find high-quality solutions with limited human guidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

From my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes GENIUS, a novel neural architecture search (NAS) approach that uses GPT-4 as a black box optimiser to efficiently search the neural architecture design space. 2. It demonstrates the potential of using a large language model like GPT-4 for automated neural architecture design, without requiring extensive domain expertise or search algorithm development.3. Through experiments on several NAS benchmarks, it shows that GENIUS can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art NAS techniques. For example, on ImageNet it obtains 77.8% top-1 accuracy using 329M FLOPs.4. The paper highlights the promising capability of GPT-4 to serve as an automated tool for assisting research and development across diverse technical domains, through simple prompting schemes.5. It also discusses limitations of the approach, including reproducibility issues, potential benchmark contamination, limited transparency into GPT-4's search process, etc. 6. The authors note safety implications of using powerful general purpose systems like GPT-4 for automated optimization, which could potentially lead to loss of human know-how and control.In summary, the key contribution is showing the potential of GPT-4 as a general purpose optimizer for neural architecture search, achieving strong results with minimal domain expertise. But the paper also highlights important limitations and safety considerations when applying such systems.
