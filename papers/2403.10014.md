# [NNCTC: Physical Layer Cross-Technology Communication via Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing cross-technology communication (CTC) schemes have limitations such as dependency on specific technologies, need for intricate algorithms to mitigate distortion, and challenges in choosing optimal parameters. 
- They are designed in a case-by-case manner for each wireless technology pair and require full understanding of signal processing details.
- Parameters are set manually and it's hard to adapt to complex environments.

Proposed Solution - NNCTC:
- Proposes Neural Network-based Cross-Technology Communication (NNCTC), a general framework to construct CTC using neural networks. 
- Converts signal processing components in CTC pipeline into neural network models that can be trained end-to-end without labeled data.
- Enables system to autonomously derive optimal CTC payload, easing development complexity. 
- Demonstrates feasibility using CTC system from WiFi to ZigBee.

Key Contributions:
- Conceptually proposes NNCTC framework to ease CTC emulation and parameter setting.
- Shows that lightweight and interpretable NNs can be used effectively for CTC.  
- Implements NNCTC on USRPs and shows applicability to multiple modulation schemes, outperforming prior handcrafted CTC schemes.
- Achieves average 92.3% packet reception rate and 1.3% symbol error rate for WiFi to Zigbee CTC link.

In summary, the paper presents a neural network-based framework called NNCTC to address limitations of prior CTC schemes. By converting components to trainable neural models, NNCTC can autonomously find optimal parameters and simplify cross-technology communication between wireless technologies.
