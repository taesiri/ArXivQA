# [VX2TEXT: End-to-End Learning of Video-Based Text Generation From   Multimodal Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12059)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main goal of this paper is to develop a unified framework for generating natural language text from multimodal inputs consisting of video plus accompanying text, speech, or audio signals. The key research questions and goals addressed are:1) How to effectively extract salient information from each modality (video, audio, text) and combine them to address a particular query or task?2) How to generate coherent, open-ended natural language text from the fused multimodal representations? 3) How to create a single, unified framework that works across different text generation tasks like video/image captioning, question answering, dialog systems without requiring specialized architectures for each task?4) How to make the entire framework end-to-end trainable, including modality-specific components, using differentiable training techniques?The central hypothesis seems to be that converting all modalities into a common semantic text embedding space will allow leveraging powerful pretrained language models like BERT or T5 for both multimodal fusion and text generation without needing ad-hoc cross-modal fusion techniques or task-specific output heads. The paper proposes techniques like differentiable tokenization to enable end-to-end training of such a framework.The effectiveness of the proposed Vx2Text framework is demonstrated through state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets spanning video QA, dialog systems, and captioning compared to prior approaches. The key innovations seem to be the end-to-end trainable pipeline achieved via differentiable tokenization and the flexibility of a single model working across different text generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. A unified framework for text generation from multimodal inputs like video, audio, text, and speech.2. A technique to convert each modality into language tokens/embeddings using learnable tokenizers and addressing the non-differentiability for modalities like video and audio. 3. An encoder-decoder architecture to fuse the multimodal embeddings and generate open-ended text via an autoregressive decoder, without needing specialized heads for each task.4. The ability to train the full model end-to-end, including the modality-specific classifiers, via a relaxation scheme. 5. Empirical results showing the approach outperforms prior methods on video-based text generation tasks like captioning, QA, and dialog by using a single unified architecture.So in summary, the main contributions seem to be the proposed unified framework for end-to-end learning of multimodal text generation using differentiable tokenization and a generative encoder-decoder architecture. The simplicity and flexibility of the approach along with strong empirical results on multiple tasks appear to be key aspects highlighted.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a unified framework called Vx2Text for generating text from multimodal inputs like video, audio, and speech. It converts each modality into a language embedding using a trainable tokenizer, enabling multimodal fusion via a transformer network without cross-modal modules. With end-to-end training via a relaxation scheme and an autoregressive decoder, Vx2Text outperforms prior work on video-based captioning, QA, and dialog tasks using a single model.
