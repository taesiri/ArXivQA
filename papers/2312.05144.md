# [Kraken: enabling joint trajectory prediction by utilizing Mode   Transformer and Greedy Mode Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05144)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Kraken, a novel deep learning model for multi-modal trajectory prediction that effectively handles interactions between agents. Kraken utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer blocks to encode inputs like maps, actor histories, and social interactions. A key contribution is the Mode Transformer module, which enables cooperation between predicted trajectory modes, covering the distribution more effectively and improving diversity. Kraken also employs a Greedy Mode Processing technique to convert initial independent predictions into feasible joint predictions for pairs of interacting agents, significantly boosting interaction metrics. Evaluated on the Waymo Motion Prediction challenge, Kraken achieved 1st place on the interaction task and 2nd place overall as of October 2021, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The method's ability to produce accurate and diverse multi-modal predictions while accounting for interactions positions Kraken as an impactful model for motion forecasting with applications to autonomous driving.
