# [Kraken: enabling joint trajectory prediction by utilizing Mode   Transformer and Greedy Mode Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05144)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Kraken, a novel deep learning model for multi-modal trajectory prediction that effectively handles interactions between agents. Kraken utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer blocks to encode inputs like maps, actor histories, and social interactions. A key contribution is the Mode Transformer module, which enables cooperation between predicted trajectory modes, covering the distribution more effectively and improving diversity. Kraken also employs a Greedy Mode Processing technique to convert initial independent predictions into feasible joint predictions for pairs of interacting agents, significantly boosting interaction metrics. Evaluated on the Waymo Motion Prediction challenge, Kraken achieved 1st place on the interaction task and 2nd place overall as of October 2021, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The method's ability to produce accurate and diverse multi-modal predictions while accounting for interactions positions Kraken as an impactful model for motion forecasting with applications to autonomous driving.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Kraken is a multimodal trajectory prediction model for autonomous vehicles that uses a Mode Transformer module and Greedy Mode Processing to accurately capture interactions between agents and produce physically plausible joint predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a novel Mode Transformer block that implements attention between the different modes of the predicted future trajectory distribution. This allows the model to cover the space of possible future trajectories more effectively and improves metrics like minADE.

2) It employs a Greedy Mode Processing algorithm inspired by non-maximum suppression to convert the initial factorized predictions for pairs of agents into feasible joint predictions that avoid collisions. This boosts the performance on the interaction prediction task. 

3) The proposed model, called Kraken, held 1st place on the Waymo Interaction Prediction leaderboard and 2nd place on the Motion Prediction leaderboard in October 2021, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, the key innovations are the Mode Transformer block for better multimodal prediction and the Greedy Mode Processing method for generating accurate joint predictions while avoiding collisions. The strong performance of Kraken on the Waymo benchmarks validates these contributions.
