# [Celestial Machine Learning: From Data to Mars and Beyond with AI Feynman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores whether the AI Feynman algorithm can emulate Johannes Kepler's discovery of the orbital equation of planet Mars from the historical Rudolphine Tables. Kepler used data collected by Tycho Brahe to determine that Mars orbits the sun in an ellipse, described mathematically by what is now known as Kepler's first law. The authors investigate if AI Feynman, which is designed to rediscover physical laws and equations from data, can replicate Kepler's discovery process and scientific reasoning in determining the elliptical orbit of Mars.

Methods: 
The authors conduct four experiments with the AI Feynman algorithm using Mars data from the Rudolphine Tables. The data consists of the astronomical measurements of Mars' angular position and distance from the sun over time. In the first experiment, AI Feynman processes the raw data with no additional biases. In experiments 2-4, the authors introduce observational and inductive biases regarding the periodic and physical nature of the data to guide AI Feynman, emulating Kepler's application of scientific knowledge and reasoning. The results along AI Feynman's accuracy-complexity Pareto frontiers are analyzed to see if the orbital equation is rediscovered.

Results:
Without any biases, AI Feynman fails to determine Mars' elliptical orbit. With appropriate observational and inductive biases reflecting domain knowledge of the physical system, AI Feynman rediscovers the precise elliptical orbital equation. The authors highlight equations along the Pareto frontiers matching Kepler's first law, showing AI Feynman's emulation of Kepler's scientific discovery process.

Conclusions:
The study demonstrates AI Feynman's ability to replicate Kepler's seminal discovery of Mars' elliptical orbit when encoded with the appropriate physics-based biases. The authors conclude that information about the periodic nature and physical units of the data provided key guidance for both Kepler and AI Feynman in determining the underlying scientific laws from measurements. Their work shows how domain knowledge and reasoning within a learning algorithm enables scientific discovery.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Using the physics-inspired AI Feynman algorithm for symbolic regression, the authors show that with appropriate inductive and observational biases reflecting knowledge of the units and periodicity of the data, Kepler's first law for the elliptical orbit of Mars can be rediscovered from the historic Rudolphine Tables.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that the AI Feynman algorithm can rediscover Kepler's first law for the orbit of Mars from the historical Rudolphine tables, when provided with appropriate biases based on knowledge of the physical units and periodic nature of the data. 

Specifically, the paper demonstrates that with both observational biases (transforming inputs known to represent angles) and inductive biases (limiting the search space based on knowledge of valid transformations for physical quantities), AI Feynman is able to rediscover the equation for Mars' elliptical orbit along its Pareto front of solutions balancing accuracy and complexity. This emulates how Kepler himself may have leveraged knowledge of the data's physical meaning to guide his discovery of the orbit equation from the tables compiled by Tycho Brahe.

So in summary, the key contribution is using AI Feynman with informed biases to replicate Kepler's scientific discovery, showing how physics-inspired machine learning can match important historical achievements given appropriate guidance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using both inductive and observational biases to guide the AI Feynman algorithm. Can you expand more on the specific inductive and observational biases used and how they help guide the search? 

2. The choice of input data provided to AI Feynman seems to significantly impact its ability to rediscover the orbital equation. What are some ways the input data could be preprocessed or encoded differently that may further improve the results?

3. The paper shows improved results when providing the sine and cosine transformed angle inputs compared to just the raw angle values. Are there any other mathematical transformations of the inputs worth exploring that could help inject useful biases? 

4. The inductive biases used limit the search space to certain function classes like trigonometric, polynomial, etc. How sensitive are the results to the exact choice of allowed function classes? What impact would allowing more complex function classes have?

5. Kepler used thought experiments and physical intuition to postulate an elliptical orbit. How could similar high-level physical knowledge be incorporated as an additional bias in the AI Feynman framework?

6. The paper mentions future work could involve directly processing raw sightings data. What additional challenges do you anticipate in that scenario and how might the method need to be adapted? 

7. Could the recursive decomposition strategy used by AI Feynman provide any insights into the physical dependencies between variables that guided Kepler's discovery? How might those insights be extracted?

8. The paper uses mean squared error to evaluate equation fitness. Could other metrics like physical consistency with laws of planetary motion lead to better equations?

9. What impact would using a larger dataset covering more time periods have? Would that help disambiguate between multiple equations that fit the current limited dataset equally well?

10. The method rediscovers the orbital equation in hindsight. How could you assess whether it has the capability to actually make a novel discovery like Kepler did historically? What evidence would demonstrate that level of reasoning?
