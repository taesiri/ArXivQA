# [Celestial Machine Learning: From Data to Mars and Beyond with AI Feynman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores whether the AI Feynman algorithm can emulate Johannes Kepler's discovery of the orbital equation of planet Mars from the historical Rudolphine Tables. Kepler used data collected by Tycho Brahe to determine that Mars orbits the sun in an ellipse, described mathematically by what is now known as Kepler's first law. The authors investigate if AI Feynman, which is designed to rediscover physical laws and equations from data, can replicate Kepler's discovery process and scientific reasoning in determining the elliptical orbit of Mars.

Methods: 
The authors conduct four experiments with the AI Feynman algorithm using Mars data from the Rudolphine Tables. The data consists of the astronomical measurements of Mars' angular position and distance from the sun over time. In the first experiment, AI Feynman processes the raw data with no additional biases. In experiments 2-4, the authors introduce observational and inductive biases regarding the periodic and physical nature of the data to guide AI Feynman, emulating Kepler's application of scientific knowledge and reasoning. The results along AI Feynman's accuracy-complexity Pareto frontiers are analyzed to see if the orbital equation is rediscovered.

Results:
Without any biases, AI Feynman fails to determine Mars' elliptical orbit. With appropriate observational and inductive biases reflecting domain knowledge of the physical system, AI Feynman rediscovers the precise elliptical orbital equation. The authors highlight equations along the Pareto frontiers matching Kepler's first law, showing AI Feynman's emulation of Kepler's scientific discovery process.

Conclusions:
The study demonstrates AI Feynman's ability to replicate Kepler's seminal discovery of Mars' elliptical orbit when encoded with the appropriate physics-based biases. The authors conclude that information about the periodic nature and physical units of the data provided key guidance for both Kepler and AI Feynman in determining the underlying scientific laws from measurements. Their work shows how domain knowledge and reasoning within a learning algorithm enables scientific discovery.
