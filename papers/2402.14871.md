# [LLM Based Multi-Agent Generation of Semi-structured Documents from   Semantic Templates in the Public Administration Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Document creation in Public Administration (PA) is complex due to the need to handle diverse semi-structured document types. Semi-structured documents have a fixed set of data without a fixed format, so understanding them requires extracting the data structure.  
- Automating the generation of semi-structured documents is challenging since template-based solutions cannot be readily applied.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with generating complex, structured outputs like semi-structured documents.

Proposed Solution:
- A multi-agent architecture using LLMs and prompt engineering to generate new semi-structured documents from examples.  
- Agents have specialized roles: Semantics Identification, Information Retrieval, Content Generation
- The document structure is extracted from an example template.
- An initial user prompt describes the desired output document. This accumulated prompt is iteratively refined.
- The output document is generated section-by-section following the template structure.
- Agents are prompted in each section to handle tasks like identifying semantics, retrieving information, generating content.
- Prompts are engineered to constrain models and prevent hallucinations.
- User intervenes when information is missing to augment the accumulated prompt.

Main Contributions:
- Novel approach combining LLMs and multi-agent systems to generate semi-structured documents with limited supervision.
- Replaces manual prompting with automatic task description generation using semantic retrieval from an LLM.  
- Demonstrates effectiveness of approach on real-world PA document generation scenarios.
- Presents prompt engineering methodology to improve agent conformity and prevent hallucinations.
- Interaction framework allows integrating additional agents to extend capabilities.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards using AI to automate complex document generation processes in PA settings. The multi-agent architecture reduces the need for human intervention.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel approach that combines Large Language Models with prompt engineering and multi-agent systems to generate new semi-structured documents compliant with a desired structure from semantically similar examples, with limited human supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and multi-agent systems to generate new documents that comply with a desired structure. Specifically, the key aspects of the contribution are:

1) Replacing manual prompting commonly used with LLMs with a task description automatically generated by semantic retrieval from an LLM. This automates part of the prompting process.

2) Demonstrating the potential of this approach through experiments and case studies in real-world public administration scenarios. This shows the applicability of the method to practical document generation tasks.

3) Presenting a workflow and interaction framework for LLM-assisted multi-agent generation of semi-structured documents with limited human supervision. This provides a methodology for implementing and applying the approach.

In summary, the main novelty is in the combination of prompt engineering, multi-agent systems, and semantic retrieval to automate parts of the LLM prompting process for generating semi-structured documents. The viability and value of this approach are shown through real-world public administration use cases.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a multi-agent architecture involving three main agents. What are the specific roles of each agent and how do they interact with each other in the document generation workflow?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering to obtain desirable outputs from the LLMs. What techniques were used for refining the prompts for each agent? How were the prompts improved incrementally? 

3. The accumulated prompt seems essential to the proposed approach. How is it initialized and updated throughout the process? What role does it play in the information flow between agents?

4. The paper argues that the multi-agent approach helps overcome limitations of individual LLMs. What specific limitations does it help mitigate? How does the interaction between agents provide advantages over a single LLM?

5. The semantics identification agent outputs instructions for reproducing semantics. Why is it important for these to be discursive rather than schematic? How does this impact later stages?

6. User intervention is required when information is missing. How is the timing of intervention determined? How are the prompts updated based on user input to improve future performance?

7. The approach seems compatible with an AI-as-a-service paradigm. What customizations would be required to deploy it in this framework? What potential obstacles or concerns may arise?

8. How does the approach handle semi-structured data where semantics may depend on surrounding context? Does it mitigate risks like hallucination? If so, how?

9. The paper focuses specifically on text generation. How could the approach be extended to improve graphical appearance or image generation tailored to document semantics?

10. What measures were implemented to make the system robust to limit cases that could disrupt workflow e.g incorrectly formatted user input? How might the system recover from or adapt to failures?
