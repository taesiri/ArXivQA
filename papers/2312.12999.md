# [Machine Mindset: An MBTI Exploration of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12999)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Personalization and consistency of personality traits is a key challenge in developing personalized AI systems based on large language models (LLMs). Prior approaches using prompts have struggled to achieve stable personalities. 

- There is a lack of suitable datasets and training methodologies to effectively embed personality traits into LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a "Machine Mindset" approach to inject specific MBTI personality types into LLM models. This is done through a two-phase training process:

1) Supervised fine-tuning using custom "behavior datasets" to enable models to generate responses aligned with a personality. 

2) Fine-tuning using "self-awareness datasets" to improve the model's ability to recognize its own embedded personality traits.

- Additionally, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is used to further refine the models' alignment with intended personality traits.

Main Contributions:

- Construction of tailored "behavior" and "self-awareness" datasets to facilitate personality embedding.

- A two-phase supervised fine-tuning methodology combining behavior modeling and self-awareness to embed personality traits into LLMs.

- Experimental demonstrations showing models exhibit responses consistent with their personality across domains like law, general knowledge, etc.

- Ablation studies analyzing impact of dataset composition ratios on resulting personality traits.

- Analysis showing embedded personalities can impact model capabilities on certain tasks, similar to humans.

In summary, the paper puts forth an innovative training process using custom datasets to inject stable and consistent personalities into LLMs, verified through comprehensive evaluations. This contributes towards progress in personalized AI.
