# [A Safety Framework for Critical Systems Utilising Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05311)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to develop a principled safety case framework to provide confidence in the safe utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially convolutional neural networks, in safety-critical systems? 

The key aspects of their proposed framework include:

- Focusing on quantitative reliability claims as the primary property of interest, using the generalisation error of DNNs as the key reliability measure. 

- Utilizing structured, heterogeneous safety arguments involving activities across the DNN lifecycle stages to provide initial confidence in reliability.

- Applying Conservative Bayesian Inference with operational data to further boost confidence in reliability claims. 

- Discussing how the framework can be extended to provide assurance for other relevant safety properties like robustness, interpretability, fairness and privacy. 

- Identifying open challenges in building safety arguments for quantitative claims and mapping them to ongoing research directions.

Overall, the paper aims to present a principled safety case framework tailored to provide confidence in DNNs being utilized safely in critical systems, with a focus on quantitative analysis. The framework aims to combine assurance activities through the lifecycle with statistical inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel safety case framework for deep neural networks (DNNs) used in critical systems. The key aspects of the framework are:

- It focuses on making quantitative reliability claims about DNNs based on probabilistic risk assessment. Reliability is measured in terms of the DNN's generalisation error.

- It utilizes Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI) to strengthen confidence in reliability claims by exploiting operational data from the deployed DNN. CBI only requires partial prior knowledge rather than a full prior distribution. 

- It maps DNN lifecycle activities to reducing different components of the generalisation error in order to obtain partial prior knowledge to feed into the CBI. For example, formal verification of robustness can provide priors on the estimation error.

- It discusses how the methodology can be extended to safety arguments for other important properties like interpretability, fairness and privacy. 

- It identifies open challenges in building safety cases for quantitative claims and maps them to ongoing research directions.

In summary, the main novelty is a structured framework for quantitative safety arguments for DNNs that leverages Bayesian inference, decomposed generalisation error, and evidence from DNN verification and validation activities. The paper also clearly lays out open problems in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel safety case framework for deep neural networks used in critical systems that utilizes conservative Bayesian inference with operational data to provide quantitative reliability claims and identify challenges in building safety arguments for such systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on safety cases and assurance for deep learning systems:

- It presents a novel safety case framework focused specifically on deep neural networks (DNNs), with a quantitative emphasis on reliability claims and generalizing this approach to other safety properties. Many existing works focus on more general AI/autonomous systems with learning components. 

- The approach relies heavily on quantitative reliability analysis using Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI). This allows probabilistic reasoning with partial prior knowledge obtained from DNN verification techniques. Other works have not explored CBI for DNN safety cases.

- The paper proposes a novel view of mapping DNN lifecycle activities to the reduction of components of the generalization error. This connects assurance activities to mathematical ML concepts.

- Open challenges are clearly identified, including justifying confidence in claims, dependencies in multi-version systems, changes in operational profile, etc. These are mapped to ongoing research directions.

- Compared to standards-driven approaches (e.g. for autonomous driving), this work provides a complementary, statistical argument to boost confidence in claims from operational data.

- The scope focuses on safety arguments for fixed DNNs. Adaptation of the approach to online learning DNNs is identified as future work.

Overall, the paper presents a principled, quantitative approach to safety cases tailored to DNNs. The reliance on CBI and view of generalisation error reduction seem unique compared to related literature. The open challenges identified also help map this work to the broader assurance research landscape.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the paper:

- Conducting concrete case studies to examine the soundness of their proposed safety case framework. They plan to continue working on the open challenges identified in the paper.

- Extending the framework to support online learning DNNs. The multivariate conservative Bayesian inference approach discussed could provide the basis for this.

- Establishing a more quantitative link between DNN lifecycle activities and reductions in the different components of the generalisation error decomposition they propose. They suggest expert judgement and experience with similar DNNs may help overcome the difficulties in doing this.

- Further developing the arguments for quantifying confidence in verification and validation results (the G8 subgoal in their Fig. 5). This could involve eliciting expert judgements and systematically collecting process data on the reliability of verification tools.

- Addressing the fundamental limitations of 'proven-in-use' arguments identified in prior work, for which they map some ongoing research areas as potential solutions.

- Incorporating additional safety-related properties beyond reliability into their framework, such as fairness and privacy.

- Evaluating whether their approach could supplement more qualitative safety arguments, and be useful as an additional heterogeneous approach within overall safety cases.

So in summary, they identify needs for more concrete evaluations, extensions to handle online learning, better quantification, addressing limitations, covering more properties, and integrating with qualitative arguments - as well as continuing to work on the open challenges mentioned throughout the paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a principled novel safety argument framework for critical systems that utilize deep neural networks (DNNs). The approach allows various forms of predictions, e.g. future reliability of passing some demands, or confidence on a required reliability level. It is supported by a Bayesian analysis using operational data and recent verification and validation techniques for deep learning. The prediction is conservative, starting with partial prior knowledge obtained from lifecycle activities and then determining the worst-case prediction. The key contributions are: (a) A quantitative safety case framework for DNNs based on structured heterogeneous safety arguments; (b) An idea of mapping DNN lifecycle activities to the reduction of decomposed DNN generalisation error used as a reliability measure; (c) Identification of open challenges in building safety arguments for quantitative claims. Overall, this paper provides a novel supplementary approach to safety cases for systems using DNNs, with a focus on quantitative reliability claims generalized to other safety properties.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a safety case framework for deep neural networks (DNNs) used in critical systems. The framework focuses on making quantitative reliability claims about the DNNs using probabilistic risk assessment. The key idea is to use Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI) to make reliability claims that improve over time as more operational data is collected. 

The framework first decomposes the generalization error of a DNN into three components: Bayes error, approximation error, and estimation error. Each of these can be minimized through activities in the DNN lifecycle stages like data collection, model construction, and model training. This provides initial confidence bounds on the DNN's reliability. Then CBI is used to update the reliability confidence bounds using operational data, starting from the initial bounds. CBI allows flexible prediction functions like posterior expected failure rate or future reliability. Open challenges are also discussed like dependence between test cases and changing operational profiles. Overall, this safety case framework provides a novel way to make quantitative confidence claims about DNN reliability using both lifecycle activities and operational data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a principled safety argument framework for critical systems that utilize deep neural networks (DNNs). The key elements of the method are:

- The safety argument is structured in GSN notation and focuses on quantitative reliability claims of the DNN, measured using the generalisation error. This is supplemented with arguments for other safety properties like fairness and privacy. 

- A two step approach is proposed. First, assurance activities conducted during the DNN lifecycle stages are argued to provide initial confidence in reliability. Second, Bayesian inference techniques are used on operational data to incrementally boost the confidence in reliability claims. Specifically, Conservative Bayesian Inference is proposed which requires only partial prior knowledge on reliability.

- The generalisation error is decomposed into three components - Bayes error, approximation error, estimation error. The lifecycle activities are argued to reduce the approximation and estimation errors towards 0. Partial prior knowledge for Bayesian inference is obtained from lifecycle activities like formal verification of DNN robustness.

- Open challenges are identified like quantitatively linking lifecycle activities to generalisation error reduction, validating assumptions of Bayesian models, and extending the approach to online learning DNNs.

In summary, the paper presents a quantitative safety framework for DNNs based on assurance arguments, Bayesian inference, and generalisation error decomposition along the lifecycle. The novelty lies in adapting reliability engineering concepts to provide confidence in DNN safety.
