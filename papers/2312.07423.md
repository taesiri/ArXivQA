# [Holoported Characters: Real-time Free-viewpoint Rendering of Humans from   Sparse RGB Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07423)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents a novel method called Holoported Characters for real-time free-viewpoint rendering of human actors from only four input camera views and respective 3D skeletal poses. The method achieves unprecedented 4K resolution output at real-time rates. It handles actors wearing loose clothing and reproduces fine-scale dynamic details like wrinkles, expressions, and gestures. The training phase requires multi-view video and a rigged surface scan of the actor. The proposed pipeline has three main stages: Stage 1 uses an improved skeleton-driven method to capture detailed dynamic mesh geometry. Stage 2 creates a view-dependent texture from four test-time views via projective texturing and a neural network. Finally, Stage 3 renders the mesh and texture into the novel view at 4K resolution using an image refinement network. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and real-time performance. The method unlocks new possibilities for immersive telepresence by establishing a new benchmark for rendering resolution/quality from sparse camera input. Key capabilities include handling loose clothing, high-quality wrinkle details, computational efficiency to enable live 4K output, and practical sparse camera requirements for real applications.
