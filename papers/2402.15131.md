## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Interactive-KBQA: Multi-Turn Interactions for Knowledge Base Question Answering with Large Language Models":

Problem:
- Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) aims to leverage structured knowledge bases to provide precise answers to natural language questions. It is an important research area with many applications. 
- Existing methods have limitations in handling complex questions, require extensive annotated data for training semantic parsers which is resource intensive, and do not fully utilize the reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces Interactive-KBQA, a novel KBQA framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tools to interact with knowledge bases (KBs) in a multi-turn, iterative dialogue process.  
- Three generic tools are designed to interact with heterogeneous KBs - SearchNodes, SearchGraphPatterns, ExecuteSPARQL. These provide unified interaction logic across KBs.
- Complex questions are categorized and only 2 exemplars per category are annotated to guide the LLM through complete reasoning processes. 
- The framework allows manual intervention to iteratively refine LLM outputs. A collaborative human-machine annotation strategy is used to create a valuable low-resource dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Interactive-KBQA framework that employs LLM as agent to perform semantic parsing via multi-turn KB interactions.
- Designs a unified toolset and interaction logic tailored for various DB schemas and complex queries.  
- Achieves strong performance with few exemplars, demonstrating effectiveness in low-resource settings.
- Releases high-quality human-annotated dataset with step-wise reasoning that further boosts performance when used to fine-tune open-source LLMs.

In summary, the paper introduces an interactive framework for KBQA that can handle complex questions in low-resource scenarios by leveraging LLMs more effectively. Both the methodology and dataset are valuable contributions.
