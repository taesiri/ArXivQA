# [Shared Affordance-awareness via Augmented Reality for Proactive   Assistance in Human-robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an augmented reality (AR) framework to enable effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) by establishing a shared understanding between the human and robot of each other's capabilities, represented as affordances. The key problem being addressed is that in HRC scenarios, there are often areas where one agent is unable to operate. It is critical for both agents to have transparency into their own limitations as well as their partner's capabilities in order to proactively request assistance when necessary. 

The main contribution of this paper is an AR interface that allows the human wearing an AR headset and the robot to build a common representation of their environment. This shared representation delineates regions that are affordable vs unaffordable to each agent based on their reachability, creating "affordance-awareness". The AR interface serves as a bridge allowing both agents to communicate their individual affordances and intent to one another. If an object is outside an agent's affordable area, they can proactively query their partner for assistance through the interface.

The proposed framework combines the action and perception spaces of both agents. Spatial anchors are used to map the environment from the perspective of the AR headset and robot's sensors into a shared coordinate frame. Object affordances are modeled as voxels marking reachable vs unreachable areas. The robot's affordances are computed offline based on its manipulator's kinematics. The human's affordances are updated dynamically based on observed arm movements. The AR interface visualizes intent as planned trajectories and allows agents to request help via cues. 

A collaborative cleaning experiment is proposed to evaluate the framework on metrics of efficiency, workload and usability compared to non-communicative and uni-directional conditions. The hypothesis is that shared affordance-awareness will enhance collaboration, reduce human workload, and improve system usability.
