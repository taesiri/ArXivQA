# [Prompt-Singer: Controllable Singing-Voice-Synthesis with Natural   Language Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11780)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Singing voice synthesis (SVS) models have achieved high audio quality and naturalness, but lack explicit control over singer attributes like gender, vocal range, and volume. 
- Using natural language prompts for attribute control is appealing, but poses challenges around decoupling pitch/melody, finding optimal text representations, and data scarcity.

Proposed Solution - "Prompt-Singer":
- Adopts a decoder-only transformer with multi-scale hierarchy to generate audio codec units conditioned on prompts, lyrics, pitch etc.
- Designed a "decoupled pitch representation" that separates vocal range and melody, enabling range control while retaining melody. 
- Explores various text encoders (BERT, FLAN, CLAP) and fine-tuning strategies to find optimal prompt representations.
- Introduces speech data to alleviate data scarcity for SVS training.

Main Contributions:
- First controllable SVS method enabling explicit control of gender, vocal range and volume using natural language prompts
- Pitch representation innovation that decouples vocal range and melody, critical for prompt-based range control
- Investigation of different text encoders and fine-tuning strategies to determine optimal prompt representations
- Demonstration of using speech data to boost low-resource SVS training

The model achieves strong attribute control accuracy and audio quality. Key limitations are potential bias in prompted data and high computational cost. Overall, this work represents an important advancement in achieving explicit and intuitive control for singing voice synthesis.
