# [Condensed Movies: Story Based Retrieval with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04208)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Can we create a large-scale dataset of "condensed movies" consisting of key scenes from movies matched with high-level semantic descriptions to facilitate story understanding and narrative retrieval in long videos?2. Does incorporating contextual information from surrounding clips in a movie improve performance on text-to-video retrieval on this dataset compared to treating clips independently? 3. Can introducing a character module that matches actor names in text queries to face tracks in videos further improve retrieval performance, especially for within-movie retrieval?The key contributions seem to be:1. Introducing the Condensed Movie Dataset (CMD) of over 3,000 movies with ordered clips, descriptions, face tracks, and metadata.2. Proposing a Contextual Boost Module to incorporate features from surrounding clips to improve video embeddings for retrieval.3. Adding a character module to allow reasoning about character identities mentioned in text queries and recognized in videos. 4. Showing improved retrieval results from the proposed context module and character module, demonstrating the benefits of modeling context and identities for story understanding.5. Providing preliminary alignment between video clips and movie plot summaries to enable placing clips in the context of the full movie narrative.In summary, the main hypothesis is that leveraging contextual information and character identities is important for narrative understanding and retrieval in videos, which they demonstrate through experiments on their new condensed movie dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:1. The introduction of the Condensed Movie Dataset (CMD), a new large-scale movie dataset consisting of key video clips and high-level semantic descriptions from over 3,600 movies. The dataset provides condensed versions of full movie storylines. 2. Exploration of the role of context in video-text retrieval by proposing a Contextual Boost Module (CBM) that incorporates features from surrounding clips to improve the video embedding. This module is added to existing state-of-the-art retrieval models.3. A character module that encodes information about character identities and their mentions in text descriptions. This module provides a significant boost on the within-movie retrieval task.4. Benchmark retrieval results on the new CMD dataset using both cross-movie and within-movie settings. The best performing model combines the Contextual Boost Module with the Mixture of Embedding Experts model.5. Preliminary work on aligning video descriptions to movie plot summaries, which could allow placing clips in the context of the full movie storyline.In summary, the key innovations seem to be the introduction of a large new movie dataset to spur progress on story understanding, and techniques to incorporate contextual information from surrounding clips to better represent videos for retrieval. The character module also appears important for modeling identities in within-movie retrieval.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in narrative understanding and text-to-video retrieval:- The proposed Condensed Movie Dataset (CMD) is much larger in scale than many existing movie/TV datasets, with over 3,600 movies and 33,000 clips. Most other datasets consist of only a few hundred movies at most. The large scale allows models to learn from more varied data.- The high-level semantic descriptions for each clip are more story-focused compared to other datasets like LSMDC that contain low-level descriptions of visual content. This allows for modeling of narrative structure. - The contextual boost module introduces longer-range temporal context across clips to improve retrieval. Most prior work has focused on context within short isolated clips. The sparsely sampled clips allow modeling context across a whole movie storyline.- The character module allows reasoning about character identities and linking them to the descriptions. Many prior datasets ignore or lack character IDs. - The text-to-video retrieval task definition focuses more on high-level semantics and narrative understanding compared to action/object recognition in other datasets.- Preliminary story-to-text alignment shows potential for utilizing larger plot context beyond individual clips.Overall, the proposed dataset, contextual modules, and retrieval task aim to push towards deeper narrative and semantic understanding compared to other benchmark datasets and methods in this space. The release of this large-scale dataset promises to enable further progress on story-focused video understanding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring global context from movie plots more fully to improve retrieval performance. The authors mention that they aligned the video clip descriptions to Wikipedia plot summaries, which provides a way to place each clip in the broader context of the movie. However, they did not incorporate this global context into their retrieval model in this work. - Extending the contextual modeling to longer time scales. The authors introduced a contextual boosting module that brought in contextual clips from before and after the target clip. However, they only experimented with 1-3 clips of context. They suggest exploring modeling context over longer timescales.- Applying the condensed movie dataset to other tasks like video summarization and video description generation. The authors propose that the dataset could be useful for these types of tasks that require higher-level understanding of movie narratives.- Developing richer models that can capture the evolution of relationships and semantics over longer movies. The contextual modeling explored in this work is a step in this direction, but the authors suggest it could be taken further.- Exploring other modalities like music and editing in understanding movie narratives. The authors focused on speech, visual, and text modalities. Adding additional modalities could provide a fuller modeling of movies.- Defining better metrics and objectives for the subjective tasks related to movie understanding. The authors mention the difficulty of evaluating high-level semantic tasks and suggest this is an area for future work.In summary, the main future directions pointed out are leveraging broader context, scaling to longer movies, applying the dataset to new tasks, integrating additional modalities, and developing better metrics for understanding and evaluating movie narratives.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset called the Condensed Movie Dataset (CMD) containing key video clips from over 3,600 movies. Each clip is accompanied by a high-level semantic description of the scene, as well as face tracks and metadata about the movie. The dataset is collected from YouTube and is freely available. The authors explore using the dataset for the task of text-to-video retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve the correct clip given its description. They introduce a Contextual Boost Module to existing retrieval architectures to incorporate contextual information from surrounding clips in the movie to better understand the significance of each scene. The module improves performance on cross-movie retrieval. They also add a character module to exploit face tracks, which significantly boosts within-movie retrieval where character identities are discriminative. The dataset provides a testbed for story understanding and reasoning over long timescales. The authors also show preliminary results aligning video descriptions to movie plot summaries, enabling modeling of clips in the context of the full movie narrative.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces a new dataset called the Condensed Movies Dataset (CMD) consisting of key video clips from over 3,600 movies, along with high-level semantic descriptions of each clip. The dataset provides a condensed look at movie storylines by including only the most salient scenes. Each clip is accompanied by context about characters, actions, emotions, and relationships. Face tracks of main characters are also provided. The dataset aims to facilitate long-range understanding of movie narratives. The paper also proposes a text-to-video retrieval task using CMD, where the goal is to retrieve a video clip given its description. They introduce a Contextual Boost Module to let models exploit contextual clips when encoding a target clip. This improves results compared to only using the target clip. For within-movie retrieval, they also add a character module to reason about character identities. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of story-based retrieval on this dataset. The contextual boosting and character modules both provide noticeable improvements.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a text-to-video retrieval method for retrieving relevant video clips from movies given a text query. The method uses a Mixture of Embedding Experts model to encode the video clips, utilizing different expert modules to encode various modalities like speech, scenes, objects, faces etc. The text query is encoded using BERT word embeddings and NetVLAD aggregation. The key contribution is a Contextual Boosting Module (CBM) which allows the model to influence the mixture weights based on contextual clips from the past/future in the movie timeline, unlike prior work which considered clips independently. Specifically, the CBM learns scalar weights for combining experts from additional context clips alongside the target clip. This allows exploiting the contextual information to better encode the target clip for retrieval. The method is evaluated on a new "Condensed Movies Dataset" collected from Youtube for text-video retrieval across movies, as well as within individual movies by incorporating a character module. The CBM provides gains over baselines without context.
