# [Goodtriever: Adaptive Toxicity Mitigation with Retrieval-augmented   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07589)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses explored in this paper are:

1) Can retrieval-augmented language models effectively mitigate toxicity in text generation without drastically modifying model parameters or requiring computationally intensive auxiliary models? 

The paper introduces a new method called Goodtriever that incorporates external datastores of toxic and non-toxic text examples to control text generation at inference time. The hypothesis is that this semi-parametric approach can match state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation performance while being more efficient.

2) Can toxicity mitigation techniques adapt to handle the evolving nature of language and shifts in what is considered offensive or harmful?

The paper argues that most prior work treats toxicity as fixed, whereas in reality the nature of offensive language changes over time. The hypothesis is that Goodtriever's flexibility, enabled by the retrieval components, will allow it to continually adapt to new types of toxic language. This is tested on a continual toxicity mitigation task.

3) How does retrieval-augmented toxicity mitigation generalize across language model sizes and families?

The paper benchmarks Goodtriever on models ranging from 124M to 6.9B parameters across the GPT2, Pythia, and OPT families. The hypothesis is that Goodtriever will show consistent toxicity reduction regardless of base model size or type.

In summary, the core questions focus on whether semi-parametric retrieval augmentation can enable efficient, adaptable, and generalizable toxicity control during text generation. The method and experiments aim to test these capabilities compared to prior work.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a flexible and computationally efficient method called Goodtriever for mitigating toxicity in language model generations. Here is a comparison to related prior work:

Training approaches: This paper contrasts Goodtriever with approaches that require modifying the pretrained language model's parameters through additional training, like finetuning on filtered corpora or conditioning the model on toxic/non-toxic attributes. Goodtriever requires no training or weight updates to the base model.

Decoding approaches: Goodtriever is compared to methods that steer generation at inference time like manipulating hidden activations or adjusting next token probabilities. Unlike some decoding methods, Goodtriever does not directly modify the output distribution which can impact fluency.

Retrieval augmentation: Goodtriever builds on recent retrieval-augmented language models, but uniquely incorporates multiple datastores to control for desirable and undesirable attributes. It also uses a different ensembling approach compared to standard kNN-LMs.

Computation: A key contribution is reducing inference latency by 43% and parameter usage compared to the previous state-of-the-art DExperts model. Goodtriever matches toxicity performance while being much more efficient.

Continual learning: The paper introduces a new continual toxicity mitigation task to evaluate model flexibility over time. Goodtriever demonstrates strong capabilities on this task compared to multitask finetuning, showcasing benefits of semi-parametric models. 

In summary, Goodtriever innovates on prior work by combining retrieval augmentation with a product-of-experts approach to efficiently mitigate toxicity without retraining. The continual learning experiments also highlight the advantages of a flexible semi-parametric model in adapting to evolving data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating specialized adaptation techniques for retrieval-augmented methods like sample selection strategies for the datastores or online adaptation of the interpolation parameter. The authors note that they did not explore these techniques in this work, but they could help further improve continual toxicity mitigation performance.

- Studying monotonic decline in toxicity as the datastores are expanded. The authors raise the question of how to best select toxic and non-toxic samples to add to the datastores to observe a monotonic decrease in toxicity.

- Applying the approach to other languages and multilingual systems. The authors acknowledge the need to develop toxicity mitigation strategies that can handle multiple languages and cultures.

- Evaluating the impact of the approach on other metrics beyond those directly reported, such as biases, repetition, factual correctness, etc. The authors primarily focused on toxicity, fluency, and diversity metrics in this work.

- Exploring the potential misuse of the method by altering the datastores to generate harmful text. The authors emphasize the need to prevent exploitation of the approach.

- Testing the approach on other domains beyond toxicity, such as politically biased language. The general framework could potentially apply to other attributes.

- Comparing to a wider range of baselines and state-of-the-art methods as they continue to evolve.

Overall, the authors highlight the need for continued research into adaptable and efficient toxicity mitigation techniques that can handle evolving language and deployments. Their work provides a strong step in this direction via retrieval-augmented language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Goodtriever for mitigating toxicity in language model generations. Goodtriever is a flexible approach that combines a language model with two external datastores containing toxic and non-toxic text examples. At inference time, Goodtriever retrieves the nearest neighbors from each datastore and ensembles their probabilities with the language model's next token probabilities using a product of experts method. This allows Goodtriever to reduce the likelihood of generating toxic text without requiring model retraining. The authors show that Goodtriever matches state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation performance while being much more computationally efficient. They also demonstrate Goodtriever's ability to adaptively mitigate evolving types of toxicity on a new continual toxicity mitigation task. Key benefits of Goodtriever are its efficiency, flexibility, and ability to handle domain shift without retraining. Overall, the work introduces a novel semi-parametric approach to controllable text generation that is highly practical.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Goodtriever, a novel approach for mitigating toxicity in language model generations. Goodtriever utilizes a retrieval-augmented framework, accessing external memories or datastores during decoding to guide text generation towards desirable attributes. Specifically, Goodtriever uses two datastores - one with toxic examples and one with non-toxic examples. During inference, the nearest neighbors from each datastore are retrieved and their probabilities are combined with the base language model's distribution using a product of experts approach. This allows Goodtriever to reduce the probability of generating toxic content while maintaining fluency. 

The authors evaluate Goodtriever on both static and continual toxicity mitigation tasks. For static mitigation, Goodtriever matches state-of-the-art methods while being more computationally efficient. The authors also introduce a new continual toxicity mitigation benchmark using data clustered into distinct demographic domains. On this task, Goodtriever is competitive with a multi-task finetuning approach, despite not requiring model finetuning. Overall, the work demonstrates how retrieval-augmented models like Goodtriever can effectively mitigate toxicity in an adaptable manner as language evolves over time. The proposed method provides a promising direction for controlling undesired model behaviors without extensive retraining.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a method called \textsc{Goodtriever} for mitigating toxicity in language model generations. \textsc{Goodtriever} is a retrieval-augmented language model that utilizes two external datastores during decoding - one containing non-toxic text examples and one containing toxic examples. For each generation context, \textsc{Goodtriever} retrieves the nearest neighbors from each datastore and ensembles their next token probabilities with the base language model probabilities using a product-of-experts approach. Specifically, the toxic and non-toxic datastore probabilities are combined through addition/subtraction of their logits, which allows tokens with high probability under the non-toxic datastore and low probability under the toxic datastore to be favored. This avoids directly modifying the base language model while still enabling control over generated toxicity. The flexibility of the datastores also allows for adapting to new types of toxicity by simply adding new examples. Overall, \textsc{Goodtriever} provides an efficient and adaptable approach to toxicity mitigation through retrieval augmentation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper is addressing the problem of generating toxic or harmful language from large language models. Some key points about the problem:

- Recent advances in large pretrained language models like GPT-3 have enabled more natural language generation capabilities, but a downside is they sometimes generate toxic, offensive or biased text. 

- Mitigating toxicity generation is challenging. Prior work has focused on computationally expensive approaches like finetuning or constrained decoding that require modifying model parameters or using auxiliary models.

- Existing methods also tend to treat toxicity as fixed and ignore how the nature of harmful language evolves over time. Models need to adapt to new types of toxicity.

- There is a need for more flexible and adaptable techniques to mitigate toxic language generation that can handle evolving data and don't require extensive retraining or modification of language models.

The main question the paper is addressing is: How can we develop efficient and adaptable methods to mitigate toxicity in language model generations? They introduce a technique called Goodtriever that tackles both static and continual toxicity mitigation through a retrieval-augmented approach.

In summary, the paper focuses on developing computationally efficient techniques that can flexibly mitigate evolving toxic language from large pretrained language models, without needing extensive retraining or modification of the models. Handling the dynamic nature of harmful language generation is a key consideration.
