# [Goodtriever: Adaptive Toxicity Mitigation with Retrieval-augmented   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07589)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses explored in this paper are:

1) Can retrieval-augmented language models effectively mitigate toxicity in text generation without drastically modifying model parameters or requiring computationally intensive auxiliary models? 

The paper introduces a new method called Goodtriever that incorporates external datastores of toxic and non-toxic text examples to control text generation at inference time. The hypothesis is that this semi-parametric approach can match state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation performance while being more efficient.

2) Can toxicity mitigation techniques adapt to handle the evolving nature of language and shifts in what is considered offensive or harmful?

The paper argues that most prior work treats toxicity as fixed, whereas in reality the nature of offensive language changes over time. The hypothesis is that Goodtriever's flexibility, enabled by the retrieval components, will allow it to continually adapt to new types of toxic language. This is tested on a continual toxicity mitigation task.

3) How does retrieval-augmented toxicity mitigation generalize across language model sizes and families?

The paper benchmarks Goodtriever on models ranging from 124M to 6.9B parameters across the GPT2, Pythia, and OPT families. The hypothesis is that Goodtriever will show consistent toxicity reduction regardless of base model size or type.

In summary, the core questions focus on whether semi-parametric retrieval augmentation can enable efficient, adaptable, and generalizable toxicity control during text generation. The method and experiments aim to test these capabilities compared to prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new method called \textsc{Goodtriever} for mitigating toxicity in language model generations. \textsc{Goodtriever} uses a flexible retrieval-augmented approach that combines a language model with external datastores containing toxic and non-toxic text examples. 

2. The paper demonstrates that \textsc{Goodtriever} matches state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation performance while being much more computationally efficient. Specifically, it reduces inference latency by 43% compared to prior methods like DExperts, and consumes far fewer parameters.

3. The paper evaluates \textsc{Goodtriever} across multiple model sizes and families including GPT-2, Pythia, and OPT models ranging from 124M to 6.9B parameters. It shows consistent toxicity mitigation capabilities across model sizes. 

4. The paper introduces a new task of "continual toxicity mitigation" which involves adapting models to handle evolving types of toxic language over time. It shows \textsc{Goodtriever} achieves strong performance on this task compared to finetuning baselines.

5. The overall contribution is a flexible and efficient toxicity mitigation technique that can handle static and continually evolving definitions of toxic language. The retrieval-based approach makes \textsc{Goodtriever} adaptable without retraining models.

In summary, the main innovation is the introduction and evaluation of \textsc{Goodtriever}, a new retrieval-augmented technique for efficient, adaptable, and effective toxicity mitigation across diverse language model families and sizes. The continual mitigation experiments also showcase the flexibility of this approach.
