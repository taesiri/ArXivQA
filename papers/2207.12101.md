# [Is GPT-3 all you need for Visual Question Answering in Cultural   Heritage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12101)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:Can GPT-3 be used to automatically generate textual descriptions of artworks that can then be exploited to answer visual and contextual questions about those artworks, avoiding the need for manually annotated image captions?In particular, the key points the paper investigates are:- Whether GPT-3 can generate high quality textual descriptions of artworks when prompted with just the name of the artwork.- Whether these automatically generated descriptions can be used in place of human-annotated captions to answer visual and contextual questions about artworks through a question answering system. - Comparing different prompting strategies for GPT-3 - using a general prompt to elicit a long description versus using the question itself as the prompt to generate a more focused description.- Evaluating the quality of the generated captions using standard image captioning metrics.- Evaluating the ability to answer visual and contextual questions about artworks using the GPT-3 generated captions on a visual question answering dataset.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that GPT-3 can automatically produce usable descriptions of artworks for the task of visual question answering, removing the need for manual annotation. The experiments aim to validate whether this hypothesis holds true.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for visual question answering in cultural heritage that relies on using GPT-3 to automatically generate descriptions of artworks. This allows answering visual and contextual questions without needing annotated image-description pairs for each artwork. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing to use GPT-3 to generate descriptions of artworks that can capture both visual and contextual knowledge. This avoids the need for manual annotation by experts.- Showing that the generated descriptions can be used with a question answering model to answer visual and contextual questions about artworks. This makes the approach artwork-agnostic.- Demonstrating the applicability of large generative language models like GPT-3 for cultural heritage applications, specifically for visual question answering. - Providing an analysis of using general vs question-based prompts with GPT-3, showing their tradeoffs. General prompts give longer, more comprehensive descriptions while question-based give more focused descriptions.- Overall, showing that GPT-3 can generate high quality descriptions of artworks that allow answering questions without needing artwork-specific training data. This could enable scalable visual question answering for cultural heritage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes using GPT-3 to automatically generate descriptions of artworks which can then be used to answer visual and contextual questions about those artworks without needing any additional training data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in visual question answering for cultural heritage:- Most prior work in VQA for cultural heritage relies on having an actual textual description or metadata about the artwork in order to answer contextual questions. This paper proposes generating the description automatically using GPT-3, removing the need for manual annotations.- The authors demonstrate that GPT-3 contains sufficient knowledge about artworks and artistic concepts to generate high quality descriptions. Other VQA methods typically require training on domain-specific datasets, whereas this approach exploits the knowledge already within GPT-3.- Using GPT-3 descriptions, the method is able to answer contextual questions competitively compared to prior work. Performance on visual questions is lower, but the authors propose a question-based conditioning of GPT-3 to improve visual question performance. - The approach is artwork-agnostic, meaning it can generalize to new artworks without any extra training. Most VQA methods require retraining or fine-tuning on each new dataset.- The authors provide both quantitative experiments and qualitative examples demonstrating the capabilities of the method. The analysis of differences between general and question-based descriptions from GPT-3 is insightful.- The work explores an interesting application of large pretrained language models like GPT-3 in the cultural heritage domain. This represents a growing trend of leveraging such models for domain-specific knowledge.Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to VQA that removes the annotation bottleneck through automatic description generation. The results are promising and the method seems generally applicable to new artwork collections. The analysis also yields interesting insights on the knowledge contained within pretrained language models like GPT-3.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring different prompt engineering strategies for GPT-3 to generate better quality descriptions and enable answering more complex questions. The authors note limitations in the visual details and factual correctness of the generated descriptions. Prompt engineering could help improve this.- Applying reinforcement learning or other techniques to learn to dynamically generate better prompts for GPT-3 based on the input question. This could help generate more focused and accurate descriptions.- Evaluating the approach on other cultural heritage datasets beyond Artpedia to analyze its generalization capabilities.- Combining the automatically generated descriptions from GPT-3 with vision-based models like in prior work to get the best of both modalities.- Analyzing the tradeoffs in cost and performance between generating fixed general descriptions versus generating specialized question-based descriptions. The former allows pre-computation while the latter may enable better question answering.- Developing methods to fact check or validate the generated descriptions to reduce incorrect factual details. This could improve reliability.- Exploring knowledge extraction and transfer learning approaches to distill art domain knowledge from GPT-3 into more compact and accessible models. This could improve feasibility.In summary, the main future directions focus on improving the quality and factual correctness of generated descriptions from GPT-3, enhancing the prompt engineering, generalizing across datasets, combining modalities, analyzing tradeoffs, and improving feasibility for real-world usage.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores using GPT-3 to automatically generate textual descriptions of artworks, which can then be used to answer visual and contextual questions about the artworks through question answering models. The key idea is that GPT-3 has sufficient knowledge about art concepts and historical details that it can generate high quality descriptions of artworks just from the artwork name. The authors test two prompting strategies for GPT-3: 1) a general prompt asking for a full description, and 2) a question-based prompt asking GPT-3 to focus on answering a specific question. They evaluate the descriptions using standard captioning metrics, showing GPT-3 generates better descriptions than a baseline captioning model. For question answering, feeding the descriptions to a QA model yields good results on contextual questions but poorer results on visual questions, especially with the general descriptions. The question-based descriptions improve visual question answering by generating targeted descriptions focused on the question details. Overall, the work demonstrates GPT-3's ability to act as a substitute for expert-written artwork descriptions, enabling question answering without any image or fine-tuning on new artwork data.
