# [Hand Avatar: Free-Pose Hand Animation and Rendering from Monocular Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12782)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an animatable and realistic hand avatar from monocular video. Specifically, the paper aims to tackle the key challenges of modeling hand geometry and texture under complex articulated motion and self-occlusion.

The key hypotheses are:

1) A high-resolution parametric hand model (MANO-HD) and part-relation-aware occupancy field (PairOF) can better represent complex hand geometry across different poses compared to prior methods. 

2) A self-occlusion-aware shading field (SelF) that disentangles albedo and illumination can model hand texture and shadowing effects caused by articulated motion.

The overall goal is to develop a HandAvatar framework that combines MANO-HD, PairOF and SelF to enable high-fidelity free-pose hand animation and rendering from monocular RGB video. The experiments aim to validate the modeling capacity and advantages of the proposed representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes HandAvatar, a novel framework for free-pose hand animation and rendering from monocular video. HandAvatar can generate realistic and smooth hand geometry as well as self-occlusion-aware texture. 

2. It develops MANO-HD, an extension of MANO hand model with higher mesh resolution, which fits personalized hand shapes better.

3. It proposes PairOF, a part relation-aware occupancy field that composes part-level geometry encodings using a local-pair decoder. This results in across-part consistent geometry. 

4. It proposes SelF, a self-occlusion-aware shading field that disentangles albedo and illumination. SelF uses directed soft occupancy to estimate illumination under articulated self-occlusion.

5. Extensive experiments show HandAvatar outperforms prior arts on animatable free-pose hand rendering with superior geometry and texture quality. It also enables intuitive hand appearance editing.

In summary, the main contribution is the complete HandAvatar framework for high-fidelity free-pose hand animation and rendering from monocular RGB video. The key novel components are the high-resolution MANO-HD model, the relation-aware PairOF, and the self-occlusion-aware SelF.
