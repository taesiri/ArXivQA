# [Hand Avatar: Free-Pose Hand Animation and Rendering from Monocular Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12782)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an animatable and realistic hand avatar from monocular video. Specifically, the paper aims to tackle the key challenges of modeling hand geometry and texture under complex articulated motion and self-occlusion.

The key hypotheses are:

1) A high-resolution parametric hand model (MANO-HD) and part-relation-aware occupancy field (PairOF) can better represent complex hand geometry across different poses compared to prior methods. 

2) A self-occlusion-aware shading field (SelF) that disentangles albedo and illumination can model hand texture and shadowing effects caused by articulated motion.

The overall goal is to develop a HandAvatar framework that combines MANO-HD, PairOF and SelF to enable high-fidelity free-pose hand animation and rendering from monocular RGB video. The experiments aim to validate the modeling capacity and advantages of the proposed representations.
