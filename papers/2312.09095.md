## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes ColNeRF, a novel neural radiance field approach designed to work effectively with sparse input views while maintaining strong cross-scene generalization ability. ColNeRF incorporates collaboration at both the input and output stages. At the input end, it employs a Collaborative Cross-View Volume Integration (CCVI) module to selectively fuse multi-view feature volumes in 3D space using an attention mechanism. This allows capturing richer scene representations by correcting potential biases from limited viewpoints. At the output stage, ColNeRF applies novel ray regularization techniques involving self-supervision between sampled points to enforce consistency in both predicted geometry and appearance across views. Specifically, an L1 loss minimizes depth discrepancies between neighboring rays for geometric consistency, while a KL divergence loss matches color distributions to epipolar line pseudo-labels for appearance consistency. Without needing additional supervisory signals, ColNeRF showcases superior performance to state-of-the-art generalizable sparse-view NeRF approaches on the DTU dataset. Meanwhile, Experiments demonstrate ColNeRF's ability to efficiently adapt to new scenes via fine-tuning, producing results comparable to scene-specific methods but with significantly lower computational overhead.
