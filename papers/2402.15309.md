# [Counterfactual Generation with Identifiability Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Counterfactual generation involves altering certain style attributes (e.g. sentiment) of data while preserving other core information (e.g. content). It requires disentangling the underlying latent representations such as content and style.
- Existing methods rely on paired data or style labeling which can be infeasible to obtain. Recent works assume independence between content and style but this assumption often does not hold. There is unaddressed dependence between content and style that varies across domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage the relative sparsity between influences of content and style variables. Style tends to have more localized influence compared to widespread content influence.
- Provide identification guarantees for content and style variables without assuming independence, allowing dependence to vary across domains. 
- Guidance translates to a VAE model called MATTE with domain embeddings, flows modeling dependence, and sparsity losses.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis showing conditions for identifiability of content and style variables with no independence assumption. Allows for varying dependence across domains. 
- MATTE framework operationalizes theoretical findings - domain embeddings, flows to model content/style dependencies, sparsity losses. Enables style intervention for counterfactual generation.
- State-of-the-art performance on unsupervised style transfer tasks across four large-scale datasets, validating effectiveness for disentanglement crucial to counterfactual generation.
- Removal of common assumptions by prior works such as independence of variables or need for multiple domains, expanding applicability.

The key insight is to leverage relative sparsity rather than absolute sparsity or independence between content and style. This enables disentanglement for counterfactual generation without paired data or style labels by identifying conditions for content and style identifiability, operationalized in the MATTE framework.
