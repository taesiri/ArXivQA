# [Mosaic-SDF for 3D Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09222)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Mosaic-SDF (M-SDF), a novel 3D shape representation for generative modeling of 3D shapes. M-SDF approximates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of a shape using a set of small local volumetric grids positioned near the shape's surface. This representation satisfies three key properties: (1) it can be efficiently computed in parallel for large shape datasets, taking under 2 minutes per shape; (2) it is parameter-efficient, focusing modeling capacity around the shape's boundary; and (3) it has a simple matrix structure compatible with powerful neural architectures like Transformers. The authors demonstrate training conditional generative models with M-SDF on two datasets, showing increased shape quality and detail compared to prior methods. Key benefits highlighted are the simplicity and efficiency of M-SDF for preprocessing large-scale shape datasets and its compatibility with existing network architectures. Experiments show strong qualitative and quantitative generative modeling results in class-conditional shape generation and text-to-shape synthesis tasks.
