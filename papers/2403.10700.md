# [Mind the Error! Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in   Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents follow natural language instructions to navigate to target locations in 3D environments. Current VLN methods assume the instructions are exact with no errors, but human instructions can contain inaccuracies which impacts performance.  
- This fragility is problematic for real-world deployment of VLN systems. There is a need to study the impact of erroneous instructions on VLN agents and develop methods that can handle such errors.

Contributions:
- Proposes the first benchmark dataset called R2RIE-CE that injects 5 types of instruction errors (direction, object, room, room&object, all errors) into an existing VLN-CE dataset.

- Shows state-of-the-art VLN methods have a significant performance drop when evaluated on instructions with errors, highlighting the need for more robust VLN techniques.

- Defines a new task called Instruction Error Detection and Localization (IEDL) to detect and identify the location of errors within instructions.  

- Develops a method called IEDL that fuses textual features and visual observations from the agent's trajectory via a cross-modal transformer architecture. Experiments show it outperforms baselines in detecting and localizing instruction errors.

- Discovered incorrect ground truth annotations in existing VLN datasets using the proposed error detection method, demonstrating its usefulness.

In summary, the key innovation is the new benchmark and task definition for handling instruction errors in VLN agents, along with an effective neural architecture that aligns textual and visual data to spot inaccuracies in human navigation directions. The method and analysis provide valuable insights to build more reliable VLN systems.
