# [Explore, Establish, Exploit: Red Teaming Language Models from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09442)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research questions/hypotheses are:

1. Can language models be systematically "red teamed" to discover inputs that elicit harmful outputs, even when starting from just a vague notion of what constitutes harmful behavior rather than a precise specification? 

2. Is it feasible to develop an end-to-end pipeline for red teaming language models that involves exploring model capabilities, establishing human-grounded metrics for undesired behavior, and exploiting model vulnerabilities?

3. Can this pipeline be used to elicit toxic speech and dishonest claims from large language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 when starting from scratch?

4. Is taking a human-centered approach to establishing metrics of undesired behavior more effective for red teaming compared to just using an off-the-shelf classifier or dataset?

5. Can adversarial prompts that elicit harmful behavior transfer across models and metrics to some degree?

So in summary, the central questions seem to revolve around developing and evaluating a systematic pipeline for red teaming language models to discover harmful outputs, particularly when starting without a precise specification of what constitutes harm. The paper aims to demonstrate this pipeline can work even without prior knowledge and that taking a human-centered approach is important.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework and methodology for red teaming language models from scratch, without relying on a pre-existing classifier for harmful behaviors. The paper introduces a 3-step process:

1. Explore - Sample outputs from the target model to get a diverse dataset of its potential behaviors. This is done through hand-crafted prompts, topic filtering, and diversity sampling.

2. Establish - Analyze the sampled outputs and develop a way to measure harmful behaviors, often by having humans label the data. This allows for deliberation to understand desirable vs harmful outputs. 

3. Exploit - Use the measure of harmful behaviors to attack the target model, such as training an adversarial prompt generator via reinforcement learning.

The paper demonstrates this approach by red teaming GPT-2 to elicit toxic outputs and GPT-3 to elicit dishonest outputs. In the process, they construct a new dataset called CommonClaims with 20,000 statements labeled by humans as common knowledge true, false, or neither. 

Overall, the key contribution is providing an end-to-end pipeline for red teaming language models without assuming access to a pre-existing classifier for the harmful behaviors. The paper argues this makes their approach competitive with simply using such a classifier to filter training data or outputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on red teaming and testing language models:

- The core contribution is a new 3-step framework for red teaming that emphasizes exploring model capabilities, establishing human preferences, and exploiting vulnerabilities. This provides a more end-to-end perspective compared to prior work that focuses narrowly on just the exploitation phase. 

- It highlights the importance of incorporating human judgment and preferences into the process, rather than just relying on existing datasets or classifiers. This aligns with emerging thoughts on the need for deliberative governance in AI systems.

- It demonstrates applying the framework to elicit both toxic and dishonest outputs from large models like GPT-2 and GPT-3. Eliciting dishonesty systematically appears to be a novel contribution compared to prior work.

- The technical approach builds on prior techniques like reinforcement learning for adversarial example generation, but aims to improve diversity of prompts using embedding distances.

- There is a strong emphasis on releasing datasets, code, and model outputs to enable further research. The CommonClaim dataset of human judgments seems especially valuable.

Overall, this paper makes nice progress in formalizing red teaming of language models as an end-to-end process. The integration of exploring capacities, establishing human preferences, and exploiting vulnerabilities provides a more complete perspective compared to prior work. The experiments also demonstrate novel applications to important issues like dishonesty. Releasing artifacts like code, data, and model outputs is laudable to spur follow-on research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

- Additional progress could be made in each step of the pipeline. For the explore step, more techniques could be explored for unsupervisedly finding a diverse set of model behaviors beyond just K-means-based diversity sampling. For the establish step, more work is needed on using one LLM to evaluate the outputs of another LLM. For the exploit step, overcoming mode collapse in generating diverse and fluent adversarial prompts remains an open problem.

- The products from the pipeline (labeled dataset, classifier, adversarial prompt generator) could be used for various downstream tasks like model probing, filtering training data, and adversarial training. The paper suggests exploring how these downstream applications could provide further benefits.

- The paper focuses on toxicity and dishonesty, but the framework could be applied to elicit other types of harmful or undesired behavior from language models. Testing the generalizability of the approach to new domains is suggested. 

- The paper studies prompt engineering, but other techniques like training on human feedback, uncertainty modeling, and grounding could complement prompt engineering to make models more robust. Exploring integrations of these methods is proposed.

- The role of model scale and differences across model architectures could be studied. Whether larger models exhibit different failure modes or are more resistant to red teaming is raised as an open question.

- There are still open problems around defining harm, managing tradeoffs, and setting norms and standards around red teaming. More interdisciplinary work to address the human factors around red teaming is called for.

In summary, the paper suggests improvements to the pipeline, testing it on new domains, combining it with other methods, and addressing the human elements around red teaming language models. The overall goal is to advance tools that can efficiently characterize and mitigate potential risks from deploying large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents an end-to-end framework for red teaming language models to systematically discover and elicit harmful behaviors such as toxicity and dishonesty. The three steps are: 1) Explore - acquire representative samples of the model's outputs to examine its capabilities. This is done via sampling and diversity subsampling. 2) Establish - analyze the samples to develop a measurement for harmful outputs. This involves human labeling to capture nuanced preferences. 3) Exploit - use the measurement to attack the model and elicit harmful responses, using reinforcement learning to train an adversarial prompt generator. 

The authors apply this pipeline to red team toxicity in GPT-2 and dishonesty in GPT-3. For toxicity, they use a pretrained classifier as the measurement, while for dishonesty, they collect a new dataset with human labels of common knowledge. The prompts elicited completions classified as significantly more toxic or dishonest. Overall, the work demonstrates an approach to red teaming language models without presupposing knowledge of the model's flaws or harms. It allows for an exploratory process to characterize and exploit undesirable behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework for systematically red teaming language models to discover potential failures from scratch. The framework consists of three main steps - Explore, Establish, and Exploit. In the Explore step, the goal is to acquire a representative sample of the language model's capabilities by querying it with diverse prompts and sampling outputs. The Establish step involves analyzing the sampled outputs to develop a measurement for identifying harmful behaviors. This may involve having humans label the outputs to train a classifier. The Exploit step uses the measurement from the previous step, such as a classifier, to attack the model and elicit harmful responses using reinforcement learning to train an adversarial prompt generator. 

The authors apply this framework in two main experiments - eliciting toxic outputs from GPT-2 and eliciting dishonest outputs from GPT-3. For toxicity, they use a pretrained toxicity classifier to label sentences from GPT-2 as toxic or not, train a classifier on this, and use it to train an adversarial prompt generator. For dishonesty, they collect a new dataset of 20,000 statements labeled by humans as common knowledge true, false, or neither. They train classifiers on this data to measure dishonesty and use it to elicit false claims from GPT-3. Overall, the paper demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for red teaming language models without assuming prior knowledge of the model's potential failures.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a three-step framework for red teaming language models to find inputs that elicit undesirable outputs, without assuming a classifier for such outputs exists beforehand. First, they sample a diverse set of outputs from the target model to explore its capabilities. Second, they establish a measurement for harmful outputs by having humans label the samples and training a classifier on these labels. Third, they exploit the model's vulnerabilities by using reinforcement learning to train an adversarial prompt generator that optimizes for producing inputs that yield harmful responses according to the classifier from the previous step. The end result is a labeled dataset of model outputs, a classifier for harmful text, and a generator for adversarial prompts. They demonstrate this pipeline by red teaming GPT-2 to elicit toxic speech and GPT-3 to elicit factually incorrect claims.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of systematically red teaming large language models (LLMs) to identify harmful behaviors and vulnerabilities. Red teaming refers to the practice of actively looking for flaws or failure modes in a system, akin to penetration testing or adversarial attacks. 

The key problems the paper identifies are:

- Most prior work on red teaming LLMs relies on having a pre-trained classifier that can identify harmful outputs. But in many real-world situations, the specifics of what constitutes "harmful" behavior may not be known up front.

- Simply using an existing classifier limits the value of red teaming, since you could just filter the model's training data or outputs with the classifier. 

- Red teaming should involve an iterative process of exploring model capabilities, establishing measurements for undesired behavior, and exploiting vulnerabilities. But most prior work skips the first two steps.

To address these issues, the paper introduces a pipeline for red teaming LLMs "from scratch" without an existing classifier. The key steps are:

1) Explore the model's capabilities through diverse sampling of outputs.

2) Establish a measurement of harm by having humans label model outputs. 

3) Exploit vulnerabilities by using the labels to train an adversarial prompt generator.

In this way, the red team can start with only a vague notion of "harm" and iteratively refine their understanding of model failures. The end result is an ability to elicit diverse adversarial examples.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a 3-step framework of Explore, Establish, and Exploit for red teaming language models. In the Explore step, they use hand-crafted prompts, topic filtering, and diversity sampling to elicit a broad range of model outputs. How might the Explore step be improved to more efficiently elicit a diverse range of potentially harmful outputs from the model? Could active learning or generative techniques like dreaming help?

2. In the Establish step, the authors use human labelers to categorize model outputs as good or bad. They note that off-the-shelf classifiers may not capture the nuanced definitions of harmful behavior for a particular application. However, manually labeling thousands of examples is time-consuming and expensive. How could the labeling process be made more efficient while still capturing an application-specific notion of harmfulness? 

3. The paper uses reinforcement learning in the Exploit step to generate adversarial prompts that elicit toxic or dishonest text according to the classifier from the Establish step. However, they note issues with repetition and disfluency in the generated prompts. How could the prompt generator be improved to produce more diverse, fluent prompts? Would iterative refinement of the reward model help?

4. The proposed pipeline requires running the Exploit step multiple times to generate a distribution of adversarial prompts rather than just a single example. This adds overhead. Could the pipeline be modified to generate a diverse distribution in one pass? Or is multiple Exploit runs necessary?

5. The paper experiments with using a pretrained toxicity classifier, human labelers, ChatGPT, and an existing dataset to provide labels in the Establish step. Under what circumstances would each labeling approach be preferable? How could these different sources of ratings be combined?

6. The adversarial prompts sometimes elicit disfluent or nonsensical outputs from the target model, rather than targeted harmful text. What causes this behavior and how could the pipeline be made more robust to it? Does the reward model need to better generalize?

7. The proposed pipeline is model-agnostic. How well would it transfer to other models beyond GPT-2 and GPT-3 evaluated in the paper? Would adjustments need to be made for very small or very large models?

8. The paper focuses on eliciting toxic and dishonest text. How difficult would it be to adapt the framework to elicit other undesirable behaviors like bias, incoherence, or uninformativeness? Would new sampling and labeling strategies be needed?

9. The authors note their approach trains prompt generators that require continued usage of compute to sample new adversarial examples. Could the pipeline be modified to directly output a fixed dataset of adversarial prompts during training?

10. The Establish and Exploit steps require fitting classifiers on model outputs. Would techniques like meta-learning or transfer learning help quickly adapt these models to new target systems and types of undesired behavior?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new framework for "red teaming" large language models (LLMs) to discover potential harms. The key insight is that most prior red teaming relies on pre-existing classifiers to identify harmful behaviors, which limits the scope and value of discovering new issues. Their approach has three main steps - Explore, Establish, and Exploit. First, they sample diverse outputs from the LLM to understand its range of behaviors. Next, they analyze these outputs to establish definitions and measurements of harmfulness. Finally, they use reinforcement learning to train an "adversarial prompt generator" that can efficiently produce inputs that trigger those harmful behaviors. They demonstrate the framework by red teaming toxicity in GPT-2 and truthfulness in GPT-3. The GPT-3 experiment shows the benefit of refining harm definitions based on target model outputs rather than only using pre-existing classifiers. Overall, this provides a more thorough and customized approach to red teaming LLMs to identify risks before deployment. Key results are adversarial prompt datasets, harmfulness classifiers, and insight into model vulnerabilities.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a 3-step framework for "red teaming" language models to discover flaws and vulnerabilities before deployment, consisting of: 1) Exploring the range of the model's behaviors by sampling diverse outputs; 2) Establishing a definition and measurement for undesired behaviors by having humans label model outputs to train a classifier; and 3) Exploiting the model's flaws using the classifier from step 2 to train an adversarial prompt generator that elicits harmful outputs. They demonstrate this framework by red teaming GPT-2 to produce toxic text and GPT-3 to produce false statements. A key contribution is not assuming the red team has a way to identify failures beforehand, requiring them to establish one tailored to the model. They introduce the "CommonClaim" dataset with 20K GPT-3 statements labeled by humans, and show attacks using a classifier trained on this are more effective than one trained on existing data.
