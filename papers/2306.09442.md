# [Explore, Establish, Exploit: Red Teaming Language Models from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09442)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research questions/hypotheses are:1. Can language models be systematically "red teamed" to discover inputs that elicit harmful outputs, even when starting from just a vague notion of what constitutes harmful behavior rather than a precise specification? 2. Is it feasible to develop an end-to-end pipeline for red teaming language models that involves exploring model capabilities, establishing human-grounded metrics for undesired behavior, and exploiting model vulnerabilities?3. Can this pipeline be used to elicit toxic speech and dishonest claims from large language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 when starting from scratch?4. Is taking a human-centered approach to establishing metrics of undesired behavior more effective for red teaming compared to just using an off-the-shelf classifier or dataset?5. Can adversarial prompts that elicit harmful behavior transfer across models and metrics to some degree?So in summary, the central questions seem to revolve around developing and evaluating a systematic pipeline for red teaming language models to discover harmful outputs, particularly when starting without a precise specification of what constitutes harm. The paper aims to demonstrate this pipeline can work even without prior knowledge and that taking a human-centered approach is important.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a framework and methodology for red teaming language models from scratch, without relying on a pre-existing classifier for harmful behaviors. The paper introduces a 3-step process:1. Explore - Sample outputs from the target model to get a diverse dataset of its potential behaviors. This is done through hand-crafted prompts, topic filtering, and diversity sampling.2. Establish - Analyze the sampled outputs and develop a way to measure harmful behaviors, often by having humans label the data. This allows for deliberation to understand desirable vs harmful outputs. 3. Exploit - Use the measure of harmful behaviors to attack the target model, such as training an adversarial prompt generator via reinforcement learning.The paper demonstrates this approach by red teaming GPT-2 to elicit toxic outputs and GPT-3 to elicit dishonest outputs. In the process, they construct a new dataset called CommonClaims with 20,000 statements labeled by humans as common knowledge true, false, or neither. Overall, the key contribution is providing an end-to-end pipeline for red teaming language models without assuming access to a pre-existing classifier for the harmful behaviors. The paper argues this makes their approach competitive with simply using such a classifier to filter training data or outputs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Unfortunately I am unable to provide a meaningful summary of the paper, as it does not contain any actual content. The paper consists only of LaTeX formatting commands and placeholder text, without any real information. If the full paper text were provided, I could attempt to summarize its key points in a sentence. However, based on the limited information here, the best I can say is that this seems to be a template for an academic paper using the NeurIPS conference formatting.
