# [On Computing Makespan-Optimal Solutions for Generalized Sliding-Tile   Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the generalized sliding tile puzzle (GSTP), which is a generalization of the classic 15-puzzle. In GSTP:
- The game board is an arbitrarily large rectangular grid with multiple "escort" spaces instead of just one. 
- Multiple tiles can move synchronously in one time step as long as there are no collisions.
- There is a "corner following constraint" meaning that if two tiles share a side, one tile can only move toward the other tile, not perpendicularly, to avoid collision.

This problem has connections to multi-robot path planning but the corner following constraint makes computing optimal solutions more challenging. The paper studies the complexity and makespan optimality structure of GSTP.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. Proves that computing optimal makespan solutions for GSTP is NP-complete, even with a polynomial number of escorts relative to the grid size.

2. Provides tighter makespan lower bounds for GSTP based on the number of escorts, ranging from Ω(m1m2/k) for k < min(m1,m2) escorts to Ω(max(m1,m2)) for k ≥ min(m1,m2) escorts.

3. Develops matching upper bounds for all escort quantities using a "Rubik Table Algorithm" strategy which involves simulating row/column permutations. Gets concrete constants on the upper bounds like O(81m1m2) steps for 1 escort and O(18m1m2) for 2 escorts.

4. Asymptotically closes the gap between lower and upper makespan bounds as a function of the number of escorts, providing a tight characterization of optimality for GSTP.

In summary, the paper provides complexity and optimality results that fundamentally advance the understanding of the generalized sliding tile puzzle, an important model for multi-agent path planning applications. The matching lower and upper bounds are a key contribution toward pinpointing the optimal makespan possible for GSTP configurations.
