# [On Computing Makespan-Optimal Solutions for Generalized Sliding-Tile   Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the generalized sliding tile puzzle (GSTP), which is a generalization of the classic 15-puzzle. In GSTP:
- The game board is an arbitrarily large rectangular grid with multiple "escort" spaces instead of just one. 
- Multiple tiles can move synchronously in one time step as long as there are no collisions.
- There is a "corner following constraint" meaning that if two tiles share a side, one tile can only move toward the other tile, not perpendicularly, to avoid collision.

This problem has connections to multi-robot path planning but the corner following constraint makes computing optimal solutions more challenging. The paper studies the complexity and makespan optimality structure of GSTP.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. Proves that computing optimal makespan solutions for GSTP is NP-complete, even with a polynomial number of escorts relative to the grid size.

2. Provides tighter makespan lower bounds for GSTP based on the number of escorts, ranging from Ω(m1m2/k) for k < min(m1,m2) escorts to Ω(max(m1,m2)) for k ≥ min(m1,m2) escorts.

3. Develops matching upper bounds for all escort quantities using a "Rubik Table Algorithm" strategy which involves simulating row/column permutations. Gets concrete constants on the upper bounds like O(81m1m2) steps for 1 escort and O(18m1m2) for 2 escorts.

4. Asymptotically closes the gap between lower and upper makespan bounds as a function of the number of escorts, providing a tight characterization of optimality for GSTP.

In summary, the paper provides complexity and optimality results that fundamentally advance the understanding of the generalized sliding tile puzzle, an important model for multi-agent path planning applications. The matching lower and upper bounds are a key contribution toward pinpointing the optimal makespan possible for GSTP configurations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies the computational complexity and optimal solution structure of the generalized sliding tile puzzle, establishing its NP-completeness as well as matching asymptotic lower and upper bounds on the minimum number of moves required to solve an instance as a function of the number of empty spaces (escorts) on the board.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Establishing that computing makespan-optimal solutions for the generalized sliding-tile puzzle (GSTP) is NP-complete, with or without an enclosing grid.

2. Deriving tighter makespan lower bounds for GSTP as a function of the number of escorts, showing an expected lower bound of Ω(m1m2/k) steps for k < min(m1, m2) escorts and a high probability lower bound of Ω(max(m1, m2)) steps for k ≥ min(m1, m2) escorts. 

3. Establishing matching makespan upper bounds for GSTP that asymptotically match the lower bounds. This includes concrete upper bounds with low constant factors for all possible numbers of escorts, effectively closing the optimality gap. For example, the paper shows GSTP can be solved in O(m1m2) steps with 2 escorts and O((m1m2)/k) steps for even k < min(m1, m2).

In summary, the key contribution is deriving tight lower and upper bounds on the makespan for solving GSTP that match asymptotically, providing a much more precise characterization of the optimality structure for this problem.

The paper focuses on analyzing the computational complexity of computing optimal solutions for the generalized sliding-tile puzzle, which is a natural extension of the well-known 15-puzzle game. Key aspects examined include establishing NP-hardness, deriving matching lower and upper bounds on the minimum makespan (number of moves) needed to solve an instance as a function of the number of "escorts", and developing constant-factor approximation algorithms. The paper introduces several gadgets and specialized terminology in the process. Overall, the key terms reflect the paper's emphasis on fundamental optimality properties and algorithmic analysis for this natural and widely applicable puzzle formulation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper establishes that computing optimal solutions for the Generalized Sliding Tile Puzzle (GSTP) is NP-complete. Can you walk through the key ideas behind the NP-hardness reduction and what makes it work? What aspects of the GSTP formulation make this problem harder than classical MAPF formulations?

2. The paper leverages the Rubik Table Algorithm (RTA) to help establish tighter upper bounds on the optimal makespan. Can you explain how RTA is applied and adapted to work for GSTP? What are some key challenges in directly applying RTA due to the corner-following constraints? 

3. For the single escort case, the paper presents an algorithm that achieves an $O(m_1m_2)$ makespan upper bound. Can you walk through the key ideas behind this algorithm and how it works? How does it simulate the needed row/column permutations despite space limitations?

4. The paper establishes an Ω(m_1m_2/k) lower bound on the expected optimal makespan. Can you explain the main intuition behind the analysis that leads to this result? How tight is this lower bound?

5. For the case of 2 escorts, the paper gives an $O(m_1m_2)$ algorithm. How does having 2 escorts help speed things up compared to the single escort case? What subroutines are developed for the 2 escort case that enable additional parallelism?  

6. When there are between 2 and min(m1, m2) escorts, the paper gives an $O(m_1m_2/k)$ algorithm. Can you explain at a high level how the escorts are utilized here to achieve this speedup? What are some key issues that need to be addressed?

7. The paper claims the algorithm works for any constant number of escorts less than min(m1, m2). What prevents it from working for a non-constant number of escorts, such as m1^{0.5} escorts? Would the analysis still hold?

8. For the case of at least m1 + m2 - 1 escorts, the paper gives a linear time algorithm. Intuitively, why does having this many escorts make the problem easier? How does the algorithm work here?

9. The paper focuses on matching asymptotic upper and lower bounds. Do you think the concrete constants established for the upper bounds are tight? Can you conceive of ways to reduce the constants further while keeping the asymptotic runtimes?

10. The paper leaves open the problem of computing optimal solutions for other objectives besides makespan. What other objectives would be worth studying for GSTP? Do you expect similar upper/lower bounds can be proven for other natural objectives?
