# [Graph-based Virtual Sensing from Sparse and Partial Multivariate   Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of multivariate virtual sensing (MVS) from sparse spatio-temporal observations. MVS refers to reconstructing missing channels of multivariate time series (MTS) at unobserved locations by exploiting observations at other locations. This is useful for many applications like estimating solar energy production where sensors cannot cover all locations due to cost constraints. However, most prior works rely on dense sensor coverage and spatial proximity of sensors, which fails when sensor coverage is sparse. The paper focuses on overcoming this key challenge.

Proposed Solution: 
The key ideas are: (1) Leverage dependencies between the target variable and available correlated variables (covariates) at each location to provide partial observability (2) Learn similarities between locations from data, not relying on spatial proximity. 

The paper proposes a novel graph-based framework to model both dependencies between channels (intra-location) and sensors (inter-location), and propagate information using graph convolutions. Specifically, it introduces:

(1) A nested graph structure with an inter-location graph connecting sensors, and intra-location graphs connecting channels.

(2) GgNet, a graph neural network architecture that propagates representations over this structure using inter and intra-location graph convolutions. It learns dependencies among channels and sensors, andlocation similarities in an end-to-end manner.

Main Contributions:

(1) A general methodology for multivariate virtual sensing using dependencies between covariates and targets, applicable beyond physical proximity.

(2) A nested graph representation to model multivariate spatio-temporal dependencies.

(3) GgNet, the first graph neural architecture for multivariate virtual sensing using this representation.

(4) Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrating superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods in sparse settings.

The framework provides a novel direction for virtual sensing research by moving beyond spatial proximity, with flexible modeling of multivariate spatio-temporal dependencies. The design of GgNet serves as a promising graph-based approach for tackling this challenging problem.
