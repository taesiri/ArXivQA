# [Activations and Gradients Compression for Model-Parallel Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training large neural network models requires large computational resources and is often done in a distributed manner across multiple machines (model parallelism). However, the communication of activations and gradients between machines can be a bottleneck, especially over slow networks. 

- Compressing the communicated activations and gradients can reduce communication overhead, but may impact model convergence and quality. There is a need to study the effects of different compression techniques applied simultaneously to activations and gradients in model parallel training.

Methods:
- The authors evaluate quantization and TopK sparsification for compressing activations and gradients in model parallel training, using ResNet on CIFAR-10 and GPT-2 fine-tuning on Wikitext as test cases.

- They also explore using error feedback (EF) techniques like EF21 to compensate for compression errors and improve convergence. A variant of EF called "EF-mixed" is proposed for TopK compression.

- Experiments are done with different compression ratios for activations and gradients to evaluate model convergence, train/test accuracy for ResNet18, and validation loss for GPT-2 fine-tuning.

Key Findings:
- Gradients are more sensitive to compression than activations - they require less aggressive compression for good convergence. 

- Top10% TopK compression causes minimal impact on convergence for ResNet18. For GPT-2 fine-tuning, up to Top20% works reasonably well.

- Compression has to be applied during inference as well to maintain accuracy - using uncompressed activations/gradients at test time hurts model quality otherwise.

- EF techniques allow model inference without compression with marginal drop in accuracy compared to compressed inference. But EF does not improve convergence over plain compression.

- AQ-SGD technique combined with TopK compression performs worse than plain TopK beyond 30% compression rate for activations.

In summary, the paper provides a systematic study of different compression techniques and rates for activations and gradients in model parallel training, providing useful practical guidelines. The analysis of inference compression and EF techniques is also a valuable contribution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores simultaneous compression techniques for activations and gradients in model-parallel neural network training, finding gradients are more sensitive to compression than activations and Top10% is the strongest TopK compression that does not severely harm convergence, while error feedback helps mitigate performance drops from not using compression at inference time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Conducting experiments on compressing both activations and gradients in model-parallel training, and empirically evaluating the convergence of models trained with quantization and TopK compressors. Key findings are that gradients require milder compression rates than activations, and Top10% is the lowest TopK compression level that does not severely harm model convergence.

2. Applying various error feedback techniques like EF and EF21 to activations and gradients compression in the model-parallel setup. The key observations are that error feedback does not improve convergence compared to plain compression, but allows model inference without compression with almost no quality drop. 

3. Evaluating how AQ-SGD error feedback works with TopK compression for activations, and finding that it does not improve convergence compared to plain TopK beyond 30% compression.

In summary, the main contribution is an empirical analysis of different compression techniques and error feedback methods applied simultaneously to activations and gradients in model-parallel training, providing insights into what compression rates work best.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores simultaneous compression of activations and gradients in model-parallel training. What are the key challenges and trade-offs in compressing both activations and gradients compared to compressing just one? 

2. The results show gradients are more sensitive to compression than activations. Why might this be the case? What differences between gradients and activations could account for this?

3. For TopK compression, the paper found 10% was the strongest compression that did not severely harm convergence. What factors determine the tolerable compression rate for TopK or other sparsification methods? 

4. The paper found error feedback techniques did not improve convergence with TopK compression. Why might this be? What modifications or alternatives could make error feedback more effective for TopK compression in model parallelism?

5. The AQ-SGD approach combined with TopK compression did not improve convergence compared to plain TopK. What underlying reasons could explain why AQ-SGD was not effective here? How could the approach be modified?

6. The paper highlights compressed inference performs much better than uncompressed inference after model-parallel training with TopK compression. What explanations are proposed for this? Are there other possible reasons?  

7. For the GPT-2 experiments, independent compression of activations and gradients led to divergence. Why might this occur with a pretrained model? Would the same happen with models trained from scratch?

8. How do the convergence results for model parallel compression compare between CNNs (ResNet) versus Transformers (GPT-2)? What architectural differences could account for variations in tolerable compression rates?

9. What practical insights does this work provide regarding permissible compression rates and techniques for efficient model-parallel training of large neural networks? 

10. What are some promising directions for future work on compression techniques or error compensation methods to enable efficient model-parallel training? What modifications could make techniques like AQ-SGD or EF more effective?
