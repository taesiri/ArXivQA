# [Geometry aware 3D generation from in-the-wild images in ImageNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00225)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating realistic 3D models traditionally requires 3D supervision which is difficult to obtain. Recent works use 2D images for supervision but rely on multi-view images or camera pose information.
- Existing datasets for 3D generation lack diversity, containing single object classes against clean backgrounds. Models trained on these have limited applicability. 
- Learning to generate 3D models from diverse in-the-wild images without additional pose/view information is an important next step.

Proposed Solution:
- Use an efficient triplane representation and a StyleGAN2-based generator to enable 3D generation from 2D ImageNet images without pose information.
- Modify StyleGAN2 architecture by adding layers to increase capacity of generator and handle diversity of data.  
- Introduce multi-view discrimination during training - rendering multiple views from each generated 3D model to stabilize training.

Contributions:
- Generator backbone architecture modified to increase capacity for handling complex in-the-wild image data.
- Eliminated need for explicit camera pose supervision by using whole-sphere view sampling and multi-view discrimination.  
- Learned to generate class-conditional 3D models and consistent novel views from diverse ImageNet images.
- Achieved state-of-the-art quantitative results (FID, IS, KID) compared to baseline method EG3D.
- Demonstrated high quality 3D model generation on ShapeNet dataset as an additional experiment.
- Showed application of trained model for efficient single-view 3D reconstruction using pivotal tuning inversion.

In summary, the paper presents a solution for 3D aware generative modeling that does not require multiple views or camera poses as supervision and can learn effectively from diverse in-the-wild image datasets like ImageNet.
