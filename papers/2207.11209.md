# [Divide and Conquer: 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation With Point-Wise   Binarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11209)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to improve 3D instance segmentation performance on point clouds, particularly for adjacent objects and incomplete instances. 

The key hypothesis is that dividing offset instance points into high and low density points, and processing them separately, can:

1) Better separate adjacent objects that are often clustered together by traditional distance clustering methods.

2) Help complete and refine instances by recovering points dropped by distance clustering. 

To test this hypothesis, the authors propose a novel "divide and conquer" strategy named PBNet that binarizes each point based on density and then clusters high density points to separate adjacent instances. Low density points are assigned via neighbor voting to complete instances. They also construct local scenes for each instance to refine segmentation and reduce over-segmentation.

In summary, the main research question is how to improve 3D instance segmentation on point clouds, with a core hypothesis that point-wise binarization and separate processing of high/low density points can overcome limitations of existing distance clustering approaches. The PBNet method is proposed to test this hypothesis.
