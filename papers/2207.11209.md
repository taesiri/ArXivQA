# [Divide and Conquer: 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation With Point-Wise   Binarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11209)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to improve 3D instance segmentation performance on point clouds, particularly for adjacent objects and incomplete instances. 

The key hypothesis is that dividing offset instance points into high and low density points, and processing them separately, can:

1) Better separate adjacent objects that are often clustered together by traditional distance clustering methods.

2) Help complete and refine instances by recovering points dropped by distance clustering. 

To test this hypothesis, the authors propose a novel "divide and conquer" strategy named PBNet that binarizes each point based on density and then clusters high density points to separate adjacent instances. Low density points are assigned via neighbor voting to complete instances. They also construct local scenes for each instance to refine segmentation and reduce over-segmentation.

In summary, the main research question is how to improve 3D instance segmentation on point clouds, with a core hypothesis that point-wise binarization and separate processing of high/low density points can overcome limitations of existing distance clustering approaches. The PBNet method is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel divide-and-conquer strategy named PBNet for 3D point cloud instance segmentation. The key idea is to binarize each point into high density points (HPs) and low density points (LPs) based on the density of points in the offset space. 

2. It develops methods to utilize the HPs and LPs for instance segmentation. HPs are grouped directly to separate adjacent instances. LPs are assigned to instances via a neighbor voting algorithm to refine and complete instances.

3. It constructs local scenes and generates weight masks for each instance to refine instance segmentation results and suppress over-segmentation. 

4. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets show PBNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. It ranks 1st on the ScanNetV2 benchmark challenge.

5. The proposed binary clustering method demonstrates consistent improvements when incorporated into other mainstream baselines like PointGroup and HAIS.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel divide-and-conquer strategy with point-wise binarization to effectively segment adjacent instances and complete instance segmentation. The local scene mechanism and integration with mainstream methods further improve performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D point cloud instance segmentation method called PBNet that divides offset instance points into high/low density categories to separately cluster adjacent objects and complete instances, and uses local scene construction with weight masks to refine and suppress over-segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D instance segmentation for point clouds:

- It tackles a key challenge in this field - segmenting adjacent objects with the same semantic label. Many existing methods like PointGroup struggle in these cases as they rely on distance clustering. 

- The proposed divide-and-conquer strategy using point-wise binarization is novel. Separating points into high/low density groups and processing them differently is intuitive yet unexplored before. This allows handling adjacent objects and incomplete instances better.

- Replacing traditional distance clustering with the proposed binary clustering leads to significant gains even when plugged into existing methods like PointGroup and HAIS. This shows the wide applicability of the key ideas.

- Constructing local scenes and weight masks to refine instances is also an interesting technique to suppress over-segmentation. It is more elegant than aggressive merging of instances used in some other works.

- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks like ScanNetV2 and S3DIS. The ScanNetV2 leaderboard results are especially impressive, showing the efficacy of the approach.

- The method does introduce some overhead during inference compared to the fastest existing techniques like HAIS. But this seems like a reasonable trade-off given the accuracy gains. There is scope to optimize the implementation further.

Overall, I think the paper proposes novel and intuitive ideas for tackling core challenges in this domain. The strong quantitative and qualitative results validate that the techniques are highly effective. The concepts of point binarization and divide-and-conquer seem generalizable to other 3D understanding tasks as well.
