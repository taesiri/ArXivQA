# [The Tempered Hilbert Simplex Distance and Its Application To Non-linear   Embeddings of TEMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13459)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a tempered generalization of exponential families called Tempered Exponential Measures (TEMs). TEMs maximize a tempered entropy function subject to a normalized power density constraint. The paper explores different parameterizations of discrete TEMs based on tempered logarithm and exponential functions, which satisfy a deformed algebra. It then establishes isometries between these parameterizations using a tempered variant of the Hilbert simplex distance, called the tempered Hilbert co-simplex distance. This distance is derived from first principles by replacing standard Riemann integration with a notion of $t$-integration when calculating lengths of curves. The resulting geometry has properties like projectivity, symmetry, and information monotonicity. The paper also proposes a differentiable approximation of the tempered Hilbert distance to enable optimization. It visualizes the geometric properties and evaluates the quality of nonlinear embeddings compared to other geometries like the hyperbolic and Hilbert simplex models. Overall, the tempered exponential family and associated information geometry offer a flexible parametric framework for machine learning with connections to thermostatistics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces tempered exponential measures, a parametric generalization of the exponential family of distributions, and develops their geometry and parameterizations, including an isometry between parameterizations based on a tempered generalization of the Hilbert simplex distance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces tempered exponential measures (TEMs), a parametric generalization of the exponential family of distributions, and studies their information geometry. The authors establish several parameterizations of discrete TEMs via Legendre dual functions of the negative tempered entropy, including minimal, unconstrained overparameterized, and constrained overparameterized forms. They then define a tempered Hilbert distance on the space of TEMs, generalizing the Hilbert simplex distance, and prove it is a metric distance. This distance satisfies information monotonicity and can be computed from the different parameterizations of TEMs. The authors explore isometric embeddings of the TEM simplex equipped with the tempered Hilbert distance into a curved manifold and Euclidean space. They also propose a differentiable approximation and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. Overall, the paper develops the information geometry of TEMs through a generalized Hilbert distance and establishes results around its mathematical properties and applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a tempered generalization of Hilbert's projective metric to measure distances between discrete tempered exponential distributions, establishing isometries to curved surfaces that allow differentiable optimization.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not seem to be focused on addressing a specific research question or hypothesis. Instead, it introduces a new mathematical framework for modeling probability distributions called "tempered exponential measures" (TEMs). The main contributions appear to be:

1) Defining TEMs and their properties, including different parameterizations, as generalizations of the exponential family of distributions. 

2) Establishing isometries between the space of TEMs equipped with a "tempered Hilbert distance" and other geometric spaces. This allows TEMs to be embedded for machine learning applications.

3) Introducing the notion of "$t$-integration" and using it to derive the tempered Funk and tempered Hilbert distances from first principles.

4) Demonstrating properties of the tempered Hilbert distance and examining the quality of its differentiable approximation for optimization problems.

So in summary, this paper develops the mathematical foundations of TEMs and establishes results connecting them to information geometry, without directly addressing a specific research question. The research enables new applications of TEMs, but testing a particular hypothesis is not the main focus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces the tempered Hilbert co-simplex geometry for discrete tempered exponential measures (TEMs). The main contributions are:

1) It provides different parameterizations of discrete TEMs via Legendre functions of the negative tempered entropy, including minimal form, unconstrained overparameterized form, and constrained overparameterized form. 

2) It establishes isometries between the space of TEMs with the tempered Hilbert co-simplex distance and other geometric spaces like the tempered variation norm space and a curved surface with the tempered norm distance. This generalizes the Hilbert simplex geometry to TEMs.

3) It defines a differentiable approximation to the tempered Hilbert distance using a tempered log-sum-exp smoothening. This allows optimization algorithms to leverage the geometry.

4) It motivates the tempered Funk and tempered Hilbert distances geometrically from first principles using a notion of tempered integration and length of curves in a tautological Finsler structure.

5) It introduces tempered variants of the Klein and Poincaré hyperbolic disk models via monotonic transformations.

In summary, the paper develops a differential geometric framework for discrete TEMs, establishing isometries and differentiable variants amenable to machine learning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new geometrical structure called the "tempered Hilbert geometry" which generalizes the standard Hilbert geometry using deformed logarithms and exponentials parameterized by a "temperature" t. The key contributions are:

1) It defines tempered variants of the Funk and Hilbert distances, as well as associated concepts like geodesics, based on a tautological Finsler structure using a notion of "t-integration". 

2) It establishes isometries between the space of discrete tempered exponential measures (TEMs) equipped with a tempered Hilbert distance and other geometric spaces like a curved tempered co-simplex surface and Euclidean space with a t-variation seminorm.

3) It explores differentiable approximations of the non-smooth max operators in the tempered distances to enable gradient-based optimization.

4) It relates the construction to tempered variants of the Klein and Poincaré hyperbolic disk models.

5) It validates the geometry by evaluating embedding quality on some datasets.

Compared to other research on Hilbert geometries and exponential family embeddings, a key novelty is the introduction of deformed logarithmic and exponential structures leading to new geometrical concepts. The information-monotonicity of the distances is also noteworthy.

While related to past work on q-exponential families and Tsallis entropy, the TEM construction and the specific choice of normalization constraint makes the geometric structure distinct. The paper builds up a richer differential-geometric framework compared to applications of Tsallis entropy in machine learning.

Overall, this paper develops a principled and formerly unexplored direction to generalize Hilbert metrics using concepts from non-extensive thermodynamics. The validation experiments and connections to hyperbolic geometry also suggest potential for applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following open research direction at the end of the conclusion:

An interesting open problem is to develop matrix Funk distances, properly integrating the case when matrices have different eigensystems. This is non-trivial because intuitively (all other things being equal), the distance should be largest when the eigensystems are the same, mimicking the fact that learning is often hardest in that case.

So they suggest exploring matrix variants of the Funk distances they have introduced, in a way that captures the intuition that learning becomes harder when data matrices have identical eigensystems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a tempered generalization of the Funk and Hilbert distances. What is the motivation behind using the t-algebra and t-integration to derive these tempered distances, as opposed to a more direct generalization? 

2) The t-Hilbert distance satisfies a t-information monotonicity property. Explain why this property is useful in the context of clustering and classification problems.

3) Explain the geometric interpretation of the isometry results between the t-Hilbert co-simplex and the curved surface tilde{V}_t^d. How does this surface change as t varies?

4) The paper shows that the t-Hilbert distance can be approximated with a differentiable loss. Analyze the tradeoffs in using a smoothed approximation versus the actual non-differentiable distance measure. 

5) How does the contraction property of positive linear maps extend to the t-Hilbert distance? Explain why the contraction factor is larger compared to the standard Hilbert distance.

6) The t-Hilbert distance generalizes the Klein hyperbolic distance using a distance transformation map ψ. Derive a similar transformation to obtain a generalized tempered Poincaré disk model.  

7) Explain the difference between the minimal and overparameterized representations of discrete t-exponential measures. What are the tradeoffs in using one versus the other?

8) The Lagrangian multiplier λ_t arises from a constrained optimization problem. Provide some intuition about why its form involves t-logarithms and derives from an application of L'Hopital's rule.

9) Compare the t-Hilbert distance geometric embeddings on sample datasets versus other existing models like Euclidean, Hyperboloid, and Hilbert simplex embeddings. 

10) The paper introduces a tautological Finsler structure to motivate the t-Funk distance via a principle of t-integration. Extend this construction to other information-geometric structures.
