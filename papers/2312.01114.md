# [TURead: An eye movement dataset of Turkish reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reading research requires investigating multiple processes like eye movement control, word identification, comprehension etc. Eye movement datasets provide empirical data to study these processes and develop computational models.
- Most available datasets are for languages like English. Turkish is an understudied agglutinating language with rich morphology and shallow orthography. Such languages are suitable to study effects of phonology, word length, frequency etc. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents TURead - a new eye movement dataset of 192 Turkish sentences read silently and aloud by 215 participants. 
- Target words were manipulated on length, frequency and number of suffixes to have 4 conditions - short/long and frequent/infrequent stems. Suffixed forms of stems were also included.
- Dataset contains variables like word lengths, frequencies, predictability, prelexical characteristics, familiarity ratings, working memory scores etc. Oral reading measures like fixation-speech interval and eye-voice span are also included.

Main Contributions:
- TURead allows investigating phonological, morphological and oculomotor aspects of reading in Turkish using empirical data.
- Analysis of TURead shows longer fixation-speech intervals compared to English/German indicating potential increased phonological processing due to shallow orthography. 
- Shorter eye-voice span compared to prior research may also result from shallow orthography's effect on working memory buffer.
- TURead can serve as benchmark to develop and test computational models of reading in Turkish.

In summary, the paper introduces a comprehensive eye tracking dataset for the relatively understudied Turkish language to facilitate research on effects of its rich morphology and shallow orthography on reading.
