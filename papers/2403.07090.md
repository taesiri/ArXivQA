# [Time Series Analysis of Key Societal Events as Reflected in Complex   Social Media Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Social media platforms contain valuable insights, but extracting meaningful information is challenging due to information overload and noise. There is a need for inductive, machine-guided methods to analyze evolving narratives on social media over time.

- The paper focuses specifically on studying narrative evolution on the niche platform GAB and messaging platform Telegram using quantitative corpus analysis techniques. It examines discourse related to the 2023 Wagner militia mutiny in Russia as a case study.

Methodology:
- The paper collects GAB posts and Telegram channel messages related to the Wagner mutiny over a 5-day period (June 22-26, 2023). 

- It employs a "keyness analysis" technique from corpus linguistics to identify significant emerging terms over time compared to a reference corpus. This allows exploration of underlying themes and narratives. 

- Specifically, Log Ratio scores are calculated for noun and verb frequencies across different timestamped corpora to quantify differences and rank terms by significance.

Key Findings:
- Analysis reveals detectable traces of narratives around the Wagner mutiny on GAB, indicating alignment with Russian state media perspectives.

- It also shows persistence of prior narratives (e.g. Ukraine invasion, US vaccine politics) alongside new narratives, demonstrating adaptation abilities.

- Clear differences found between Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels in timing and perspectives related to mutiny coverage.

Main Contributions:
- Provides technical pipeline to identify signals of narrative innovation/continuity in social media posts over time.

- Applies this methodology to understudied contexts of GAB platform and Telegram channels.

- Demonstrates ability to extract insights into evolving narratives and compare across multiple domains.

- Discusses integrating inductive computational techniques with critical interpretation frameworks as an area for future research.

Overall the paper lays out an approach to decipher time series narrative shifts in complex, noisy social media data.
