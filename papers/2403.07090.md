# [Time Series Analysis of Key Societal Events as Reflected in Complex   Social Media Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Social media platforms contain valuable insights, but extracting meaningful information is challenging due to information overload and noise. There is a need for inductive, machine-guided methods to analyze evolving narratives on social media over time.

- The paper focuses specifically on studying narrative evolution on the niche platform GAB and messaging platform Telegram using quantitative corpus analysis techniques. It examines discourse related to the 2023 Wagner militia mutiny in Russia as a case study.

Methodology:
- The paper collects GAB posts and Telegram channel messages related to the Wagner mutiny over a 5-day period (June 22-26, 2023). 

- It employs a "keyness analysis" technique from corpus linguistics to identify significant emerging terms over time compared to a reference corpus. This allows exploration of underlying themes and narratives. 

- Specifically, Log Ratio scores are calculated for noun and verb frequencies across different timestamped corpora to quantify differences and rank terms by significance.

Key Findings:
- Analysis reveals detectable traces of narratives around the Wagner mutiny on GAB, indicating alignment with Russian state media perspectives.

- It also shows persistence of prior narratives (e.g. Ukraine invasion, US vaccine politics) alongside new narratives, demonstrating adaptation abilities.

- Clear differences found between Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels in timing and perspectives related to mutiny coverage.

Main Contributions:
- Provides technical pipeline to identify signals of narrative innovation/continuity in social media posts over time.

- Applies this methodology to understudied contexts of GAB platform and Telegram channels.

- Demonstrates ability to extract insights into evolving narratives and compare across multiple domains.

- Discusses integrating inductive computational techniques with critical interpretation frameworks as an area for future research.

Overall the paper lays out an approach to decipher time series narrative shifts in complex, noisy social media data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores narrative evolution on the niche social media platform GAB and the messaging service Telegram regarding the Wagner mutiny event by using quantitative corpus-based methods to identify key emerging terms and traces of narratives over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a methodology for deciphering time series events in social media data to extract useful narrative signatures that correlate with real-world events and evolve over time. Specifically, the paper:

1) Provides a technical pipeline using keyness analysis (Log Ratio metric) to identify emerging or persistent narratives in social media data, demonstrating its effectiveness through a case study on the Wagner mutiny event using data from the niche platform GAB and messaging service Telegram. 

2) Applies this methodology to study the relatively unexplored platform GAB, providing one of the first quantitative and qualitative analyses of narratives on this channel. The paper suggests studying niche platforms can help extract signals from bigger social networks.

3) Contributes an approach to inductively detect narrative shifts on social media and gain insights into underlying community dynamics. The analysis reveals both the recurrence of certain narratives and their adaptation to current events.

4) Discusses the value but also limitations of automated keyness analysis for interpreting meaning, highlighting the need for critical frameworks that integrate human interpretation. 

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an exploratory methodology to extract and analyze evolving narratives from social media time series, using a case study to demonstrate its application. The paper emphasizes the importance of studying niche platforms and inductive approaches to gain insights into online narratives.

The paper focuses on analyzing the time series evolution of narratives on the niche social media platform GAB and the messaging platform Telegram related to the Wagner mutiny event. It employs quantitative corpus linguistics techniques like keyness analysis using the Log Ratio metric to identify important nouns and verbs in the text data. The goal is to detect emerging disinformation narratives and compare them across platforms and countries. Overall, the paper demonstrates a methodology for deciphering meaningful signals from complex social media data streams.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a keyness analysis approach to study narrative evolution in social media data. What are the main advantages of using a keyness analysis compared to other quantitative approaches for studying narratives? What limitations does it have?

2. The keyness metric used in the paper is the Log Ratio. What does this metric specifically measure and why was it chosen over other keyness metrics? How does it allow for the identification of emerging narratives?

3. The paper applies the keyness analysis on two different platforms - Gab and Telegram. What differences were observed in the narratives between these platforms? What commonalities were found? What might explain these differences and commonalities?  

4. Time series data is gathered in the paper spanning the Wagner mutiny event. In what ways does this particular event allow for effective analysis of the time dimension of narratives? What are the limitations of focusing on a single, short duration event?

5. The paper finds correlations between peaks in Gab activity and key events related to public statements during the Wagner mutiny. What is the significance of these correlational findings? How might the causal relationships underlying these correlations be further investigated?

6. The analysis reveals both the recurrence of certain narratives over time as well as adaptation to current events on Gab. What theoretical implications do these dual dynamics have for understanding the sustenance of disinformation campaigns?

7. The paper hypothesizes connections between communities spreading false narratives about topics like Ukraine and US politics with the Wagner mutiny narratives. What additional analyses could be done to further evaluate these hypothesized connections?  

8. What additional steps could be taken to incorporate greater semantic information into the keyness analysis methodology proposed in the paper? What enhancements would this allow for interpreting the meaning of key items?

9. The paper argues inductive, machine-guided methods are needed for mining narratives from large amounts of social media data. What are the tradeoffs between manual versus automated analysis of narratives from a methodological standpoint?

10. The paper focuses exclusively on textual data. What opportunities exist for expanding the analysis to multimedia data such as images and videos shared on social platforms? What methodological innovations would this require?
