# [Causality for Earth Science -- A Review on Time-series and   Spatiotemporal Causality Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Overview
This paper provides a comprehensive review of causal discovery and causal inference methods for time series and spatiotemporal data, with a specific focus on applications in Earth Science research. 

Problem Statement
Understanding causality is critical for advancing Earth Science research and addressing pressing environmental challenges like climate change. However, complex interactions, feedback loops, confounding effects, and lack of controlled experiments make determining causality difficult. Traditional climate models are expensive and have limitations. Hence, there is a need for data-driven causal discovery and causal inference methods that can uncover causal mechanisms from observational data.

Proposed Solution  
The paper reviews key concepts, assumptions, approaches, state-of-the-art methods, and applications of causal discovery and causal inference for time series and spatiotemporal data. 

For causal discovery, constraint-based, score-based, and functional causal model approaches are explained. Specific time series methods like Granger Causality, PCMCI, LiNGAM, etc. and their variants are discussed. For spatiotemporal data, methods like Mapped-PCMCI, interactive causal discovery, and deep learning models are covered.

For causal inference, potential outcome framework and do-calculus approaches are introduced. Marginal structural models, convergent cross mapping, instrumental variables, representation learning models are some of the time series causal inference methods reviewed. For spatiotemporal settings, propensity score models, interrupted time series, among others are explained.

The paper also compiles applications, datasets, and software to enable causality research for Earth Science. Challenges, opportunities, and future directions are discussed.

Main Contributions
- Comprehensive primer on causal discovery and inference tailored to Earth Science data
- Review of state-of-the-art methods for time series and spatiotemporal causal analysis 
- Applications, datasets and software to enable data-driven causal Earth Science research
- Identification of challenges and opportunities for advancing causality research to address environmental problems

By covering the breadth and depth of causality methods for Earth Science, the survey will benefit both data science and earth science communities interested in applying causality to study environmental processes and dynamics.
