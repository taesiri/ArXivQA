# [How Free is Parameter-Free Stochastic Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of parameter-free stochastic optimization, where the goal is to design algorithms that can achieve optimal convergence rates without requiring precise knowledge of problem parameters like smoothness, noise levels, etc. Existing "parameter-free" methods still require non-trivial assumptions on parameters for optimal performance. The paper inquires whether fully parameter-free methods are possible and under what conditions.

Main Contributions:

1) Non-convex setting: The paper shows a simple tuning technique based on grid search over SGD stepsizes that results in a fully parameter-free algorithm matching the rate of optimally-tuned SGD up to polylog factors. This is much simpler and achieves better guarantees than recent adaptive methods like AdaSGD.

2) Convex setting with noisy function values: A similar tuning approach results in a fully parameter-free method matching tuned SGD, under mild assumptions on the noise in function values. This demonstrates the viability of parameter-free optimization given reasonable stochastic function value access.

3) Convex setting with only stochastic gradients: The paper proves an information-theoretic lower bound showing it is impossible to match tuned SGD without knowledge of either gradient noise or distance to optimum up to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ factors. A novel projected SGD variant is provided matching this limit, being near parameter-free when noise bound is known up to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

4) Convex and smooth case: The SGD variant is shown to be near parameter-free here as well, achieving the SGD rate up to noise tolerance terms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first parameter-free method for stochastic convex smooth optimization.

Overall, the paper provides several new parameter-free algorithms, proves limitations in achieving full parameter-freeness, and shows matching upper and lower bounds indicating when and to what extent parameter-free performance is possible. The results bridge theory and practice in stochastic optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the feasibility and limitations of designing fully parameter-free stochastic optimization algorithms that can match the performance of optimally tuned methods without requiring significant knowledge of problem parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) In the non-convex setting, it shows that a simple hyperparameter search technique for tuning SGD step size results in a fully parameter-free method that matches the convergence rate of optimally tuned SGD up to polylog factors. This is better than existing adaptive methods like AdaGrad which require knowledge of problem parameters for optimal tuning.

2) In the convex setting with access to noisy function values, it provides a simple parameter-free method that achieves the convergence rate of tuned SGD up to polylog factors, under mild assumptions on the noise in function values. This shows that parameter-free optimization is possible in this setting.

3) In the convex setting with only stochastic gradient access, it establishes a lower bound showing that no method can be fully parameter-free while matching the rate of tuned SGD. It also provides an algorithm that is parameter-free up to an unavoidable lower order term prescribed by this lower bound.

4) For the convex smooth case, it shows that the proposed method for the convex non-smooth case also achieves the convergence rate of tuned SGD up to polylog factors and the unavoidable lower order term.

In summary, the key contributions are providing parameter-free methods with convergence rates matching tuned SGD in some settings, as well as establishing limitations of parameter-freeness in other cases. The paper also shows advantages over existing adaptive methods in some settings.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that performing hyperparameter search through grid search allows achieving comparable performance to optimally tuned SGD in the non-convex setting. Does this indicate that more sophisticated adaptive methods may not be necessary, or are there still potential advantages to using adaptive methods over grid search?

2. Could more advanced hyperparameter search techniques like Bayesian optimization further improve over the simple grid search approach? How might the performance compare?

3. For the convex setting with access to function values, what types of assumptions on the noise scale would be reasonable for different applications? Can you provide examples of problems where the noise assumptions made here would or would not hold?

4. The convex optimization method relies on noisy function values. How would the convergence guarantees degrade if there was bias or non-uniform variance in the stochastic function estimates? 

5. The lower bound result shows limitations on being fully parameter-free with only stochastic gradient access. Do you think this result can be tightened further or is it essentially unimprovable?

6. The estimation technique used to get a bound on the noise scale requires an initialization that is a "bad enough" approximate minimizer. Can this assumption be relaxed or replaced with a different type of assumption?

7. For the convex and smooth optimization result, could accelerated methods like Nesterov's accelerated gradient method lead to improved convergence over SGD even in the limited information setting studied here?

8. The methods here match the rates of tuned SGD only up to polylog factors. Do you think closing this gap in the rates is possible with a different approach?

9. The analysis relies on martingale-based concentration inequalities. Could there be room for improvement in the analysis by using different proof techniques?  

10. How well would you expect the methods here to perform in practice compared to simpler approaches like grid search over SGD or running multiple restarts? Are the guarantees proven here necessary to get good empirical performance?
