# [How Free is Parameter-Free Stochastic Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of parameter-free stochastic optimization, where the goal is to design algorithms that can achieve optimal convergence rates without requiring precise knowledge of problem parameters like smoothness, noise levels, etc. Existing "parameter-free" methods still require non-trivial assumptions on parameters for optimal performance. The paper inquires whether fully parameter-free methods are possible and under what conditions.

Main Contributions:

1) Non-convex setting: The paper shows a simple tuning technique based on grid search over SGD stepsizes that results in a fully parameter-free algorithm matching the rate of optimally-tuned SGD up to polylog factors. This is much simpler and achieves better guarantees than recent adaptive methods like AdaSGD.

2) Convex setting with noisy function values: A similar tuning approach results in a fully parameter-free method matching tuned SGD, under mild assumptions on the noise in function values. This demonstrates the viability of parameter-free optimization given reasonable stochastic function value access.

3) Convex setting with only stochastic gradients: The paper proves an information-theoretic lower bound showing it is impossible to match tuned SGD without knowledge of either gradient noise or distance to optimum up to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ factors. A novel projected SGD variant is provided matching this limit, being near parameter-free when noise bound is known up to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

4) Convex and smooth case: The SGD variant is shown to be near parameter-free here as well, achieving the SGD rate up to noise tolerance terms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first parameter-free method for stochastic convex smooth optimization.

Overall, the paper provides several new parameter-free algorithms, proves limitations in achieving full parameter-freeness, and shows matching upper and lower bounds indicating when and to what extent parameter-free performance is possible. The results bridge theory and practice in stochastic optimization.
