# [Large Language Models for Mathematicians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04556)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides an overview of large language models (LLMs) and their potential to assist mathematicians. After explaining the technical details behind LLMs like GPT-4, including the transformer architecture, the authors discuss best practices for using LLMs for mathematics. They explain that directly prompting an LLM to prove theorems often results in invalid proofs, so it is better to use LLMs for more limited tasks like searching literature, providing proof ideas, proof checking, and collaborative writing. An empirical evaluation shows that the latest LLMs can reliably provide mathematical definitions when prompted but still struggle with solving complex problems like Olympiad questions or advanced analysis. While not yet at a level to automate or replace mathematicians, LLMs show promise in complementing human reasoning, for example by catching gaps in proofs. The performance of LLMs on mathematical reasoning continues to improve with more advanced models. The emergence of widely available models like GPT-4 makes LLMs accessible for supplementing mathematical work.
