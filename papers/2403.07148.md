# [Stochastic Extragradient with Random Reshuffling: Improved Convergence   for Variational Inequalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on solving finite-sum variational inequality problems (VIPs) that arise in many machine learning applications like generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. Existing algorithms for solving these problems, like the Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method, typically use stochastic gradients sampled uniformly at random from the finite-sum. However, in practice SEG is implemented using without-replacement sampling, where the dataset is shuffled randomly at each epoch. This leads to a gap between theory and practice. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper studies SEG with Random Reshuffling (SEG-RR), which shuffles the dataset randomly at each epoch before using the data sequentially in that epoch. The key theoretical contribution is providing convergence guarantees for SEG-RR in solving strongly monotone, affine, and monotone VIPs. This helps bridge the gap between theory and practical implementations.

Main Contributions:

- For strongly monotone and affine VIPs, the paper shows SEG-RR achieves faster convergence than uniform sampling SEG, matching benefits proven for other algorithms like SGDA-RR.

- For monotone VIPs, SEG-RR can converge to any target accuracy without large batch sizes, unlike uniform sampling SEG.

- Convergence guarantees are also provided for other variants like Shuffle Once SEG and Incremental Extragradient.

- A novel "switching" stepsize rule is suggested, allowing SEG-RR to achieve a O(1/k) convergence rate to the exact solution.

- Experiments on quadratic games, bilinear games, and Wasserstein GANs empirically demonstrate faster convergence for SEG-RR over uniform sampling SEG.

Overall, the paper provides both theoretical and empirical evidence that Random Reshuffling can improve performance of SEG for solving finite-sum VIPs. The analysis helps explain the prevalent use of without-replacement sampling in practical implementations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes Stochastic Extragradient with Random Reshuffling (SEG-RR) for solving finite-sum variational inequality problems, proves faster convergence compared to standard SEG with uniform sampling for strongly monotone, affine, and monotone regimes, and shows superior empirical performance of SEG-RR.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides the first convergence analysis and guarantees for the Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method with random reshuffling (SEG-RR) for solving finite-sum variational inequality problems. 

2) It shows both theoretically and empirically that SEG-RR can achieve faster convergence compared to SEG with uniform sampling for strongly monotone, affine, and monotone problems.

3) For monotone problems, it proves that SEG-RR can converge to any arbitrary accuracy without requiring large batch sizes, which is a limitation of SEG with uniform sampling.

4) It also provides convergence guarantees for other variants of SEG with without-replacement sampling, such as Shuffle Once SEG and Incremental Extragradient.

5) It suggests a novel switching stepsize rule for SEG-RR that allows establishing a O(1/k) convergence rate to the exact solution.

6) It performs extensive experiments on quadratic strongly monotone problems, bilinear games, and Wasserstein GANs that validate the superior empirical performance of SEG-RR over uniform sampling SEG.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis showing the benefits of using random reshuffling in the Stochastic Extragradient method for solving variational inequality problems.

The paper analyzes the convergence properties of the Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method with random reshuffling of data points (SEG-RR) for solving finite-sum variational inequality problems. It establishes theoretical guarantees for SEG-RR under different problem settings - strongly monotone, affine, and monotone operators.

Other variants like Shuffle Once SEG and Incremental Extragradient are also studied. The theoretical findings are supplemented by numerical experiments on quadratic strongly monotone problems, bilinear games, and Wasserstein GAN training.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the stochastic extragradient method with random reshuffling proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows improved convergence guarantees for the stochastic extragradient method with random reshuffling compared to standard stochastic extragradient. Can you explain the key proof techniques that enable deriving these improved guarantees? How does analyzing without-replacement sampling complicate the analysis?

2. For strongly monotone variational inequality problems, the paper establishes a convergence rate of O(1/nK^2) for the stochastic extragradient method with random reshuffling. Can you walk through the steps in the proof of this result? What are the key challenges in improving this convergence rate further? 

3. The paper provides convergence guarantees for the method in three settings: strongly monotone, affine, and monotone variational inequality problems. Can you summarize the key differences in the analysis between these three cases? Which case do you think provides the most challenges for analysis and why?

4. One of the benefits shown for random reshuffling is avoiding the need for large batch sizes in the monotone setting. Can you explain why large batch sizes are necessary for standard stochastic extragradient but not for the variant with random reshuffling?

5. The paper introduces a switching stepsize rule that allows establishing a O(1/k) convergence rate to the exact solution. Can you walk through how this switching rule is constructed? When does the method switch from constant to decreasing stepsize and why?

6. In addition to random reshuffling, the paper also analyzes shuffle once and incremental extragradient variants. What are the key differences between these methods and where do their analyses diverge from the random reshuffling case?

7. The experiments focus on strongly monotone quadratic, bilinear zero-sum games, and Wasserstein GANs. Can you think of other problem settings where random reshuffling could help and propose some experiments to test its benefits?

8. Do you think the improved convergence guarantees would also hold for a distributed version of stochastic extragradient with random reshuffling? What additional challenges would need to be addressed in that setting?

9. The analysis does not assume bounded variance or growth conditions on the stochastic gradients. How does this impact the analysis and what technique is used to overcome this?

10. One of the open questions raised is extending the analysis to structured non-monotone settings. What makes these settings more difficult to analyze theoretically and what progress needs to be made to handle them?
