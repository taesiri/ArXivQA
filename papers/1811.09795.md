# [Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning with Space-Time Cubic   Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09795)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goal of this paper is to develop a self-supervised method for learning spatio-temporal features using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on unlabeled video data. Specifically, the authors propose a novel pretext task called "Space-Time Cubic Puzzles" to train 3D CNNs in a self-supervised manner on large-scale unlabeled video datasets like Kinetics. The key hypothesis is that by solving these puzzles, the 3D CNN will be forced to learn rich spatio-temporal representations from videos without requiring manual labels.The main research questions addressed are:- Can we design an effective pretext task based on 3D cubic puzzles that teaches a 3D CNN to learn useful spatio-temporal features from unlabeled videos? - How does the proposed self-supervised 3D representation learning approach compare to supervised pretraining and other self-supervised methods based on 2D CNNs?- Can the learned features transfer well to downstream action recognition tasks compared to other unsupervised and self-supervised approaches?In summary, the core goal is self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning from videos using 3D cubic puzzles, with a focus on transferring the learned features to video action recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new self-supervised pretext task called "Space-Time Cubic Puzzles" for learning video representations using 3D CNNs. Specifically:- They propose a novel pretext task where a 3D CNN must arrange a set of spatio-temporal video crops that have been randomly permuted. This forces the network to understand both the spatial appearance and temporal dynamics in video clips in order to solve the puzzles. - This is the first work to focus on using 3D CNNs for self-supervised video representation learning. Prior self-supervised methods use 2D CNNs which cannot directly capture spatio-temporal information. - They provide extensive experiments showing their learned 3D video features transfer better to action recognition tasks compared to prior self-supervised methods using 2D CNNs.- Their method significantly closes the gap with fully supervised pretraining on Kinetics. When transferred to UCF101, their self-supervised 3D CNN improves +23.4% over training from scratch and achieves comparable performance to using 1/8th of the Kinetics labels.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel pretext task to enable self-supervised learning of spatio-temporal video representations using 3D CNNs, which has not been sufficiently addressed before. The experiments demonstrate their method's effectiveness for video action recognition.
