# [Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning with Space-Time Cubic   Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09795)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research goal of this paper is to develop a self-supervised method for learning spatio-temporal features using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on unlabeled video data. Specifically, the authors propose a novel pretext task called "Space-Time Cubic Puzzles" to train 3D CNNs in a self-supervised manner on large-scale unlabeled video datasets like Kinetics. The key hypothesis is that by solving these puzzles, the 3D CNN will be forced to learn rich spatio-temporal representations from videos without requiring manual labels.The main research questions addressed are:- Can we design an effective pretext task based on 3D cubic puzzles that teaches a 3D CNN to learn useful spatio-temporal features from unlabeled videos? - How does the proposed self-supervised 3D representation learning approach compare to supervised pretraining and other self-supervised methods based on 2D CNNs?- Can the learned features transfer well to downstream action recognition tasks compared to other unsupervised and self-supervised approaches?In summary, the core goal is self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning from videos using 3D cubic puzzles, with a focus on transferring the learned features to video action recognition.
