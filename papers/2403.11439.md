# [StyleChat: Learning Recitation-Augmented Memory in LLMs for Stylized   Dialogue Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Stylized dialogue generation is important for building engaging dialogue agents using large language models (LLMs). However, it suffers from lack of high-quality supervised data and poor generalization to new styles. 

- Existing methods rely on low-quality pseudo data or back translation, resulting in dialogues that lack diversity and individuality. 

- Prompt-based LLMs also struggle to generalize to new styles not seen during pre-training. Their performance declines significantly when dealing with complex instructions and new domains.

Proposed Solution:
- Constructs StyleEval, a large-scale high-quality dataset with 38 distinct styles and 24,728 stylized dialogues. Uses generative power of LLMs and rigorous human evaluation.

- Proposes StyleChat framework to enhance style generalization ability using two strategies:
   1) Recitation-augmented memory strategy: Models recite style profiles then generate responses during training. Recalls profiles then responds during inference. Teaches implicit chain of thought.
   2) Multi-task style learning: Additional training on style transfer helps better learn differences between styles.

Main Contributions:

- StyleEval dataset with 38 styles and careful quality control to enable style-playing.

- StyleChat framework that uses recitation-augmented memory and multi-task learning to improve generalization to new styles.

- Extensive experiments showing StyleChat outperforms baselines on StyleEval. Automatically measures style accuracy and confirms with human evaluation.

- Analyses on multiple choice questions, multi-turn dialogues and different LLMs demonstrate capabilities in maintaining styles.

- Case studies and discussions further highlight effectiveness over other methods in producing stylistic and relevant responses.
