# [Redefining "Hallucination" in LLMs: Towards a psychology-informed   framework for mitigating misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT sometimes produce false, misleading information in a deceptively confident manner, termed "hallucinations". This can have dangerous consequences given LLMs' vast user base.  
- The term "hallucination" is misleading when applied to LLMs, since actual hallucinations involve perception and subjective experience which LLMs lack. A new terminology is needed.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a new taxonomy for LLM issues based on concepts from psychology like cognitive biases and memory errors. Terms like "source amnesia", "availability heuristic", "cognitive dissonance", etc. are introduced.
- This new taxonomy allows for a more nuanced understanding of the various phenomena underlying LLM failures, setting the stage for targeted solutions. 

- Drawing lessons from human psychology, the paper recommends incorporating "artificial metacognition" - self-monitoring, self-correction etc. - to make LLMs more reliable. Ideas like tracking data provenance, simulated reflective processing, constrained divergent-convergent response generation are discussed.

Key Contributions:
- Critically examines the misleading nature of the term "hallucination" when applied to LLMs
- Provides new taxonomy for LLM issues based on concepts like cognitive biases, memory errors, metacognition etc. 
- Discusses potential directions like artificial metacognition to mitigate problematic LLM behaviors inspired by human psychology
- Overall, promotes interdisciplinary approach combining AI and psychology to tackle challenges with advanced LLMs.
