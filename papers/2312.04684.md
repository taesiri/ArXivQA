# [Latent Skill Discovery for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04684)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as an effective strategy for improving language models on reasoning tasks by having them generate intermediate rationales to reach the final answer. 
- A key challenge is designing effective CoT prompts by selecting suitable demonstrations from an example bank to guide the model. 
- For CoT prompting, rationale selection should be based on the reasoning skills they demonstrate rather than surface features. However, existing methods either use ad-hoc heuristics for selection or require expensive manual annotation of skills.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a skill model to formulate rationale generation via latent skills. Specifically, rationales are generated by first sampling a reasoning skill based on the question, then generating the rationale conditioned on the skill.
- They propose Reasoning Skill Discovery (RSD) method to learn the skill model in an unsupervised way from question-rationale pairs using a conditional variational autoencoder. This discovers a continuous reasoning skill space and learns to infer skills from questions and rationales.
- The learned skill representation enables a theoretically grounded skill-based demonstration selection method for CoT prompting that retrieves examples displaying skills that align with those required for the test question.

Contributions:
- Introduces skill model, a new formulation to explain CoT reasoning using latent skills, and verifies its efficacy.
- Proposes RSD, an unsupervised and sample-efficient method to discover reasoning skills and match them for selecting CoT demonstrations. 
- Provides theoretical analysis to justify optimality of skill-based demonstration selection.
- Empirically demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of RSD for CoT prompting on multiple datasets and across diverse language models. The method does not require expensive inference or annotation and is language model agnostic.

In summary, the paper presents a novel rationale skill discovery approach to effectively select demonstrations for chain-of-thought prompting in an unsupervised, sample-efficient and language model agnostic manner. Both theoretical and empirical evidence support the efficacy of this skill-based selection strategy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Reasoning Skill Discovery (RSD) that uses unsupervised learning to discover latent representations of rationales called reasoning skills and select effective demonstrations for chain-of-thought prompting based on reasoning skill similarity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the latent skill model, a plausible formulation for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and empirically verifies its effectiveness through four sets of experiments. 

2. It proposes RSD, a novel unsupervised demonstration selection approach for CoT prompting, which is both sample-efficient and large language model-agnostic.

3. It provides theoretical analysis that grounds the skill-based demonstration selection method for CoT prompting.

In summary, the paper proposes an unsupervised skill discovery framework called RSD that can effectively select demonstrations for CoT prompting by modeling the latent skills involved in generating rationales. This approach outperforms existing methods on multiple reasoning tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting: A strategy to improve language model performance by adding intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) between questions and answers.

- Demonstration selection: The task of selecting good examples from an example bank to include as demonstrations in a prompt. 

- Reasoning skills: Latent representations of rationales that capture high-level reasoning concepts. The paper proposes discovering these skills in an unsupervised way.

- Skill model: A formulation that generates rationales conditioned on latent reasoning skills and questions. This provides a framework for skill-based demonstration selection. 

- Reasoning policy: Learned model that selects reasoning skills based on questions. Part of the proposed conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE).

- Reasoning skill encoder: Learned model that maps question-rationale pairs to reasoning skills. Also part of the CVAE.

- Retrieval-RSD: Proposed method that performs demonstration selection based on similarity of reasoning skills predicted by the CVAE models.

Key terms also include conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), in-context learning (ICL), and the datasets used for evaluation like TabMWP, GSM8K, Spider, and COGS.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a "skill model" to explain the generation of rationales in chain-of-thought reasoning. Can you elaborate on why modeling the generation process using latent skills is a sensible choice? What are the advantages of this approach compared to alternative formulations?

2. The skill model assumes a dependency between the latent skill variable z and the question Q. What is the justification for introducing this dependency? How does it differ from and improve upon the formulation in prior work? 

3. The paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach called RSD to discover reasoning skills and learn a reasoning policy from an example bank. Can you walk through the technical details of the RSD method? In particular, explain the loss function and how the encoder, decoder, and reasoning policy networks are trained.

4. Theorem 1 states that under certain assumptions, RSD enables optimal prompting for chain-of-thought reasoning. Walk through the key steps in the proof of this theorem. What are the key assumptions made and why are they reasonable?

5. The skill-based demonstration selection method is grounded in the proposed skill model formulation. Provide an intuitive explanation for why selecting demonstrations showcasing similar skills to the test question is an effective strategy.

6. Empirically, RSD outperforms alternative baseline methods significantly. Analyze the results and discuss what factors contribute to RSD's strong performance. Are there any limitations or weaknesses observed?

7. The visualization in Figure 5 shows separated reasoning skill clusters that align well with human-labeled skills. Analyze this visualization and discuss how it provides insight into RSD's efficacy. Does this analysis generalize beyond the specific TabMWP examples visualized?

8. The paper claims RSD is sample efficient and LLM agnostic. Evaluate the extent to which empirical results support these claims. In your opinion, what are the practical benefits of these properties?

9. The related works discuss alternative approaches SKiC and Skill-KNN for skill-based demonstration selection. Contrast RSD with these methods and analyze the tradeoffs between automated vs prescribed skill modeling. Which approach do you think is more promising and why?

10. Discuss potential extensions or improvements to the RSD method, either by elaborating on limitations mentioned in the paper, or proposing novel research directions that build upon this work. What do you see as the most promising path forward?
