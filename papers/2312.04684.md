# [Latent Skill Discovery for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04684)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as an effective strategy for improving language models on reasoning tasks by having them generate intermediate rationales to reach the final answer. 
- A key challenge is designing effective CoT prompts by selecting suitable demonstrations from an example bank to guide the model. 
- For CoT prompting, rationale selection should be based on the reasoning skills they demonstrate rather than surface features. However, existing methods either use ad-hoc heuristics for selection or require expensive manual annotation of skills.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a skill model to formulate rationale generation via latent skills. Specifically, rationales are generated by first sampling a reasoning skill based on the question, then generating the rationale conditioned on the skill.
- They propose Reasoning Skill Discovery (RSD) method to learn the skill model in an unsupervised way from question-rationale pairs using a conditional variational autoencoder. This discovers a continuous reasoning skill space and learns to infer skills from questions and rationales.
- The learned skill representation enables a theoretically grounded skill-based demonstration selection method for CoT prompting that retrieves examples displaying skills that align with those required for the test question.

Contributions:
- Introduces skill model, a new formulation to explain CoT reasoning using latent skills, and verifies its efficacy.
- Proposes RSD, an unsupervised and sample-efficient method to discover reasoning skills and match them for selecting CoT demonstrations. 
- Provides theoretical analysis to justify optimality of skill-based demonstration selection.
- Empirically demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of RSD for CoT prompting on multiple datasets and across diverse language models. The method does not require expensive inference or annotation and is language model agnostic.

In summary, the paper presents a novel rationale skill discovery approach to effectively select demonstrations for chain-of-thought prompting in an unsupervised, sample-efficient and language model agnostic manner. Both theoretical and empirical evidence support the efficacy of this skill-based selection strategy.
