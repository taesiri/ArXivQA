# [Better Understandings and Configurations in MaxSAT Local Search Solvers   via Anytime Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06568)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing assessments of MaxSAT local search (LS) solvers focus on the quality of the best solutions found within a given time budget. This provides limited insights into the solvers' behavior and convergence over time.  
- There is a need for an "anytime performance" metric that can assess and compare solvers across different time budgets in a quantitative way. Such a metric should also aggregate performance across problem instances.

Proposed Solution:
- Use empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) to measure the anytime performance of MaxSAT LS solvers. 
- ECDF indicates the fraction of obtained solutions meeting a specific quality level over time. It has a ratio scale and can be aggregated across instances.
- Assess four state-of-the-art MaxSAT LS solvers using ECDFs on standard benchmarks. Observe advantages/disadvantages of solvers across instances and time budgets.

Key Contributions:
- First anytime performance assessment of MaxSAT LS solvers using ECDFs. Reveals insights invisible in fixed-budget assessments.
- ECDF distinguishes solver performance differences and convergence behavior across instances and time budgets. Can guide solver improvements.  
- Demonstrate ECDF as optimization cost function for hyperparameter tuning leads to better solver configurations in terms of anytime and best-solution performance.
- Analysis techniques easy to apply to other solvers. ECDF useful for understanding algorithm behavior in different scenarios.

In summary, the paper introduces ECDFs to assess and compare the anytime performance of MaxSAT LS solvers. This reveals new insights compared to fixed-budget metrics and can guide solver enhancements. Using ECDFs to tune solver configurations also improves performance. The analysis methodology is broadly applicable.
