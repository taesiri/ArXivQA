# [PreGIP: Watermarking the Pretraining of Graph Neural Networks for Deep   Intellectual Property Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04435)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pretraining graph neural networks (GNNs) on large datasets requires huge computational resources and is valuable intellectual property of the model owner. However, adversaries may steal and deploy pretrained GNNs for their own purposes without authorization.  
- Existing watermarking methods for GNNs focus on supervised training and require downstream task information. They are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN encoders which do not have labels or tasks.
- Hence, there is a need for methods to watermark self-supervised pretraining of GNNs to protect intellectual property, without knowing details of downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution - PreGIP:
- Incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to enforce similar embeddings for pairs of random synthetic watermark graphs during pretraining.
- Includes a term to maintain margin between synthetic and real graphs, preserving utility.
- Uses consistency of predictions on watermark graph pairs by downstream model as verification signal.
- Employs finetuning-resistant watermark injection so watermarks persist even if adversary fine-tunes pretrained GNN. 

Main Contributions:
- Formulates new problem of watermarking self-supervised pretraining of GNN encoders for IP protection, without needing downstream tasks.
- Proposes PreGIP method with task-free watermarking loss and finetuning-resistant watermark injection.
- Provides theoretical analysis to show downstream classifiers produce consistent predictions on watermark graph pairs.
- Demonstrates high watermarking performance of PreGIP across various datasets and experimental settings, without sacrificing utility for downstream tasks.

In summary, the paper tackles the important problem of protecting pretrained GNN intellectual property, by watermarking the pretraining phase itself in a task-agnostic manner. The proposed PreGIP approach is shown to be effective even when adversaries fine-tune the GNN, with negligible impact on performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of graph neural network encoders for intellectual property protection without needing the downstream task information, while maintaining model utility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel framework called PreGIP for watermarking the pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) to protect their intellectual property. The main contributions are:

1) It studies a new problem of watermarking the pretraining of GNN encoders without requiring knowledge of the downstream tasks, which has not been explored before. 

2) It proposes a task-free watermarking approach that can embed watermarks into the pretraining process while preserving the quality of the learned graph embeddings. This is achieved through a specially designed watermarking loss function.

3) It develops a finetuning-resistant watermark injection algorithm that can preserve the watermarks even after an adversary fine-tunes the pretrained GNN encoder for downstream tasks. 

4) Extensive experiments show PreGIP can effectively identify unauthorized use of the watermarked pretrained GNNs while maintaining high performance on downstream tasks. Both watermarking effectiveness and model utility are demonstrated.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel end-to-end framework PreGIP to provide intellectual property protection for pretrained GNN encoders through task-free watermarking, which has not been studied before. Both methodological innovation and empirical verification of the approach are presented.

The paper focuses on protecting the intellectual property of pretrained graph neural network models using watermarking techniques.
