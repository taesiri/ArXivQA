# [Dichotomy of Early and Late Phase Implicit Biases Can Provably Induce   Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18817)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies the recently discovered "grokking" phenomenon where neural networks first memorize the training data before suddenly transitioning to perfect generalization. The authors provide the first rigorous analysis proving this phenomenon can occur in homogeneous neural nets trained with large initialization and small weight decay. They show there is a dichotomy between the early and late phase implicit biases - initially gradient flow gets trapped at the kernel predictor corresponding to the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, but after $\sim \frac{1}{\lambda}\log\alpha$ steps it transitions sharply to the max-margin/min-norm solutions. This mismatch and later alignment of the implicit biases with tasks requiring sparsity is shown to cause grokking. Concrete manifestations are demonstrated in sparse linear classification with diagonal nets and in matrix completion. The theory also suggests a novel "misgrokking" phenomenon where good early generalization is destroyed later, and experiments confirm this. Overall, the work provides a precise characterization of grokking stemming from the dichotomy of implicit biases, backed by both theory and experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key idea in the paper:

This paper studies the "grokking" phenomenon in neural network training theoretically, and shows that it can be induced by a dichotomy of early and late phase implicit biases towards kernel predictors vs min-norm/max-margin predictors when training with large initialization and small weight decay.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides theoretical analysis to help explain the "grokking" phenomenon sometimes observed when training neural networks. The key contributions are:

1. It rigorously proves that training homogeneous neural nets with large initialization and small weight decay can lead to a very sharp transition from solutions that behave like kernel methods to min-norm or max-margin solutions. This transition in the implicit bias of the training algorithm during optimization can help explain the sudden jump in test accuracy seen in grokking.

2. It provides concrete examples with diagonal linear nets and overparameterized matrix completion that exhibit either grokking or "misgrokking" (where test accuracy suddenly drops) depending on the dataset, further validating the theory. 

3. The analysis reveals a novel "kernel regime" for homogeneous nets even with weight decay, where the network behaves similarly to kernel methods. This contributes new theoretical understanding of the training dynamics.

Overall, the paper offers valuable theoretical insights into optimization and generalization that can explain and reproduce the puzzling grokking phenomenon through a dichotomy of early vs late phase implicit biases. The analysis is grounded in rigorous proofs and supplemented by illuminating experiments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, here are some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper:

- Grokking phenomenon: The surprising phenomenon where a neural network first memorizes the training data before suddenly transitioning to generalizing well on the test data after further training.

- Implicit bias: The tendency of optimization algorithms to prefer certain kinds of solutions without being explicitly optimized for that. This paper studies how the dichotomy of implicit biases in early vs late training phases causes grokking.

- Kernel regime: The early phase of training where the neural network behaves similar to a kernel method predictor based on the Neural Tangent Kernel and fits the training data well but does not generalize. 

- Rich regime: The later phase of training where the neural network escapes the kernel regime and starts converging to max-margin or minimum norm solutions that tend to generalize better.

- Sharp transition: The rapid switch between memorization and generalization exhibited in the grokking phenomenon, which this paper provides a quantitative explanation for through the analysis of training phases.  

- Homogeneous neural nets: Neural networks whose output scales homogenously with respect to scaling the parameters, includes commonly used MLPs and CNNs.

- Large initialization: Initializing neural network weights to large values, combined with small weight decay, is hypothesized to cause the dichotomy of implicit biases leading to grokking.

- Weight decay: Adding an explicit regularization term to reduce the parameter norm, small but non-zero weight decay induces an implicit bias that causes the transition from kernel regime to rich regime.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that the dichotomy of early and late phase implicit biases can provably induce grokking. Could you expand more on why this dichotomy arises in neural network training with large initialization and small weight decay? What specific properties of large initialization and small weight decay lead to this dichotomy?

2. The paper focuses on homogeneous neural networks. Could you discuss the difficulties in extending the analysis to non-homogeneous networks? Would we expect similar phenomena in common non-homogeneous networks like ResNet?

3. In the linear classification experiments, could you elaborate on why the max $L^1$-margin solution generalizes much better than the max $L^2$-margin solution in sparse settings? Does this rely on specific properties of the data distribution?

4. The convergence analysis in Section 4 relies on the smoothness assumption. Could similar results be shown without this assumption by using nonsmooth analysis tools like Clarke subdifferential? What new challenges would arise?

5. The paper shows only convergence to KKT points, not global optimality, in the rich regime. Do you believe global optimality can be shown under reasonable assumptions? What types of assumptions would be needed? 

6. The analysis focuses on gradient flow. How would the results change if stochastic gradient descent were used instead? Would we still expect a sharp transition phenomenon?

7. The paper argues small weight decay is necessary for observing a sharp transition in test accuracy. But how small exactly should weight decay be to enable this transition? Can we quantify more precisely the dependence between the weight decay factor and transition sharpness?

8. One could argue that the theoretical setups considered are quite simplified compared to real-world problems like ImageNet classification. Do you believe similar grokking dynamics happen in much more complex neural architectures and datasets? What evidence supports your answer?

9. The paper introduces the intriguing concept of "misgrokking" where test accuracy drops sharply after initial fitting. What types of problems might exhibit this phenomenon, beyond the constructed linear classification example? Are there any well-studied real datasets that could potentially misgrok?

10. The analysis relies heavily on properties of homogeneous networks. Do you think it's possible to expand the theory to capture grokking dynamics in more complex, modern architectures like Transformers that contain normalization and skip connections? What new proof ideas would be needed?
