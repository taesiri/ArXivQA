## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the development of a new cybernetic avatar called "Yui" for remote communication applications. Yui features a highly expressive human-like head with 28 degrees of freedom capable of conveying emotions, speech-related mouth movements, gaze, and head orientation. An immersive head-mounted display interface allows operators to naturally control Yui's gaze using eye tracking and reproduce their own facial expressions on the avatar in real-time using face tracking sensors. Stereoscopic cameras in Yui's eyes and binaural microphones in the ears allow the operator to perceive realistic 3D sight and sound from Yui's perspective, enhancing their sense of presence. Experiments demonstrate Yui's emotional facial expression capabilities and the ability of the system to reflect the operator's expressions. Simple teleoperation trials suggest the system's potential to enhance communication by transmitting the operator's nonverbal behaviors and emotions to interlocutors interacting with the avatar. Overall, the highly expressive cybernetic avatar Yui coupled with the immersive control interface offers promising avenues for improving avatar-mediated communication experiences.
