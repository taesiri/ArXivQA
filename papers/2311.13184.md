# [AS-LLM: When Algorithm Selection Meets Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13184)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel algorithm selection framework called AS-LLM that integrates algorithm features into the selection process. Unlike traditional methods relying solely on problem features, AS-LLM leverages pre-trained language models (LLMs) to extract representations from both problem instances and algorithm code. It comprises distinct tracks for problem and algorithm feature extraction. Problem features are obtained from traversing the tree structure of objective functions. Algorithm features are extracted by feeding code snippets into LLMs like CodeBERT. AS-LLM then calculates the similarity between problem and algorithm embeddings to determine the best match. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over competing methods, especially with limited training data. Ablation studies validate the significance of modeling algorithm features and similarity calculation. Further tests showcase AS-LLM's potential as an evaluation benchmark for LLMs' code comprehension capabilities by embedding different LLMs and comparing performance. Key merits include better aligning the bidirectional essence of selection tasks, higher accuracy with fewer samples, and versatility across problem types. Overall, the integration of expressive algorithm features paves the way for more effective and aligned algorithm selection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel algorithm selection framework called AS-LLM that integrates algorithm features extracted by pre-trained language models along with problem features to model the bidirectional relationship and improve selection accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing a novel algorithm selection framework called AS-LLM that integrates algorithm features into the algorithm selection process. Specifically, AS-LLM has two key aspects:

1) It leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to extract features from algorithm code text. This allows capturing algorithm representations in a general way across different algorithms. 

2) It models the bidirectional relationship between algorithms and problems by computing the matching degree between algorithm representations and problem representations. This differs from traditional techniques that mainly focus on mapping from problem features to algorithms.

The paper shows that by considering algorithm features and modeling algorithm-problem relationships, AS-LLM demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, especially when training data is limited. The framework is also versatile to adapt to different problem types. Additionally, AS-LLM provides a way to benchmark code comprehension capabilities of different LLMs. So in summary, the main contribution is pioneering the integration of algorithm features into algorithm selection through the proposed AS-LLM framework.
