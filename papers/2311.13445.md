# [Transfer Attacks and Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13445)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks designed to fool neural network models on coding tasks. It focuses specifically on adversarial examples generated using a white-box attack on a smaller seq2seq model trained for code summarization. The authors evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude-Instant-1, and Claude-2, as well as the open-source CodeLlama. They find that adversarial code examples reliably transfer from the seq2seq model and fool the LLMs, with attack success rates ranging from 21-53% across models. To mitigate this vulnerability, the authors propose prompt-based self-defense techniques leveraging the LLMs' own capabilities for in-context learning and understanding instructions. These defenses involve modifying prompts to include perturbed code examples or explicit guidance for reversing perturbations. Additionally, a novel meta-prompting approach is introduced to have the LLM generate its own defensive prompt. Experiments demonstrate reduced attack success rates under 6-17% with prompt defenses. The combination of perturbation-aware meta-prompting and the GPT-4 model leads to the greatest attack resiliency. The work provides key insights on adversarial vulnerabilities of LLMs for coding while introducing prompt-engineering strategies to enhance model robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies adversarial attacks on large language models for coding tasks, proposes prompt-based defenses to improve robustness, and introduces a meta-prompting technique where the language model generates its own defense prompt.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) designed for coding tasks to adversarial attacks originally crafted to fool smaller, specialized neural code models. The authors generate adversarial examples using a white-box attack on a seq2seq model and test their transferability to commercial LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as well as open-source models. They find significant attack success rates across all models, demonstrating susceptibility to black-box transfer attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, the authors propose prompt-based defenses leveraging the LLMs' own capabilities, including few-shot learning with adversarial examples and instructions for inverse transformations. Notably, they also introduce meta-prompting where the LLM generates its own defensive prompt, surpassing manually engineered prompts. Experiments validate prompted defenses and meta-prompting as effective strategies to improve robustness against adversarial code perturbations for LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks originally designed to fool smaller code models, proposes prompt-based defense strategies to improve model robustness without retraining, and shows that having the language model generate its own defensive prompt via meta-prompting leads to the most effective defense.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper aims to investigate the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks designed for code models. Specifically, it evaluates whether adversarial examples crafted to fool smaller, specialized neural network models for code (such as seq2seq) transfer to LLMs when used for code summarization tasks. The key research questions addressed are:

(1) Do adversarial attacks generated for a small code model (seq2seq) transfer to LLMs, degrading their performance on coding tasks? 

(2) Can prompt-based defenses that leverage LLMs' own capabilities of understanding instructions and performing in-context learning help improve their robustness against such transfer attacks?

(3) Can the process of designing effective prompt-based defenses be improved by using LLMs themselves to generate the prompts (an approach called meta-prompting)?

Through experiments, the paper demonstrates attack transferability from small models to LLMs and shows that prompt-based defenses, especially ones based on meta-prompting, can significantly enhance model resilience.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(1) Studying the transferability of code attacks obtained based on a small code model to five commercial and open-source state-of-the-art LLMs. The experiments show that adversarial examples are transferable, with attack success rates of at least 21% observed on GPT-4.

(2) Proposing self-defense techniques against transfer attacks that leverage LLMs' own capabilities of performing in-context learning and understanding human instructions as well as code. The defenses reduce attack success rates, e.g. to 14% for GPT-4.

(3) Proposing a meta-prompting technique that uses an LLM itself to generate prompt defenses, further reducing attack effectiveness, e.g. to 4% for GPT-4. 

(4) Techniques to customize LLMs for code summarization tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to prior work on adversarial attacks and defenses for neural network models on coding tasks:

1. It is the first work to systematically study the transferability of adversarial examples from smaller, non-LLM models (like seq2seq and code2seq) to modern large language models (LLMs). It shows that attacks generated for cheaper, smaller models do transfer to expensive commercial LLMs, making attacks much more practical.

2. It proposes novel prompt-based defense techniques that leverage LLMs' own capabilities rather than requiring adversarial retraining. These "self-defense" prompting strategies provide instructions to reverse perturbations and improve robustness.

3. The concept of "meta-prompting" is introduced - using the LLM itself to generate optimal prompts for self-defense. Experiments show meta-prompts can outperform manually designed prompts.

4. The study focuses specifically on coding tasks and programming language models, an important emerging application area for LLMs that has lacked analysis on adversarial vulnerabilities.

So in summary, this is the first work to show transferability of cheap non-LLM attacks to LLMs for coding, and proposes prompt-based defenses that leverage LLMs' own abilities. The idea of meta-prompting for synthesizing optimal prompts is also novel.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

1. Investigating techniques to frame the search for optimal self-defense prompts as an optimization problem. They mention using either gradient-based search over LLM parameters (for models that allow access to gradients) or black-box optimization techniques that require multiple calls to the LLM.

2. Exploring the use of abstain detection strategies for other applications like detecting out-of-distribution inputs.

3. Evaluating the meta-prompting techniques on other LLMs beyond GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

4. Computing attacks that directly optimize on the LLMs to construct adversarial examples, rather than just transferring attacks from smaller models. The authors note that such attacks would be expensive but could provide further insight.

In summary, the main future directions are: optimizing self-defense prompts, using abstain detection for other tasks, evaluating meta-prompting more broadly, and directly attacking LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes prompt-based defenses against adversarial attacks on large language models for coding tasks. What are some potential limitations or drawbacks of relying solely on prompts to defend models rather than other methods like adversarial training?

2. The defense strategies leverage large language models' capabilities for in-context learning and understanding instructions. How robust are these capabilities across different models and tasks? Could the defenses fail if models struggle with certain types of instructions?  

3. The paper finds that large language model generated prompts can outperform manually crafted prompts for defending against attacks. What explanations could account for this surprising result? Does it reveal something fundamental about the nature of effective prompting?

4. The perturbation-aware meta-prompting technique tailors prompts based on assumptions about potential adversarial perturbations. How sensitive are the results to these assumptions? What happens if attackers find ways to make perturbations that violate the assumed set?

5. Could the effectiveness of meta-prompting for generating defensive prompts extend beyond coding tasks? What other domains or applications could benefit from this technique? What challenges might arise?

6. The abstain option shows promise for detecting confusion in models. What other out-of-distribution detection tasks could this capability be useful for? How should detection thresholds be set?

7. The paper studies transferability of attacks from small code models to large language models. Could defenses transfer as well? Is it possible to use small models to find defenses for large models? 

8. How efficiently can the defenses scale? As model size grows exponentially, will computational constraints limit the ability to leverage meta-prompting and chains of model queries?

9. The defenses aim to counteract a specific predefined set of perturbations. How can they be made more generalizable to novel unseen attacks? Is there a way to teach models higher-level robustness?

10. Are there other creative ways similar to meta-prompting to utilize a model's own capabilities to analyze and improve itself? What other self-referential techniques seem promising for machine learning models?
