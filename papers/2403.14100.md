# [Causal knowledge engineering: A case study from COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14100)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- COVID-19 emerged abruptly in 2020, requiring rapid modeling to understand the disease despite limited data and knowledge. Many early COVID-19 models had to rely on expert assumptions to supplement limited data. 
- There was no structured approach for identifying, validating and documenting causal assumptions in these early models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors embarked on a knowledge engineering process to develop a causal knowledge base for COVID-19 consisting of several Bayesian Networks (BNs) capturing different aspects (e.g. diagnosis, pathophysiology).

- They developed a method called Causal Knowledge Engineering (CKE) to systematically build such a causal knowledge base to support various COVID-19 models.

- CKE provides a structured approach to synthesize causal knowledge from literature, data, experts into reusable modular BNs that form the knowledge base.

Key Contributions:
- Details a CKE workflow with 5 key steps: defining purpose/scope, reviewing knowledge sources, recruiting experts, developing top-level framework and modular BNs.  

- Describes a typical BN elicitation workflow to engage experts, including preparation, workshops, follow-ups and iterations.

- Provides a catalogue of useful techniques for utilizing knowledge sources, developing BN structures, and revising BNs.

- Uses their COVID-19 causal knowledge base development as a case study to demonstrate and analyze the CKE method.

- CKE enables building a modular reusable base of causal knowledge to support various application-specific models, ensuring valid and consistent encoding of causal assumptions.

In summary, the paper proposes and details the CKE methodology to systematically develop causal knowledge bases consisting of modular BNs that can support COVID-19 and other modeling efforts when data is limited.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces Causal Knowledge Engineering (CKE), a structured approach for developing a causal knowledge base consisting of causal Bayesian networks and associated materials to support building application-specific models, and uses the case study of COVID-19 modeling to illustrate and analyze the method in detail.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a knowledge engineering methodology called Causal Knowledge Engineering (CKE). Specifically:

- CKE provides a structured approach for building a causal knowledge base consisting of causal Bayesian networks (CBNs) that capture qualitative causal knowledge about a problem domain. 

- The causal knowledge base is intended to support the development of various downstream application models and systems. For example, it could help in developing clinical decision support systems, prognostic models, etc.

- The paper illustrates the CKE methodology using a case study of developing causal knowledge models for COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. This involved capturing evolving expert knowledge through techniques like workshops, surveys, literature review, etc.

- Compared to some existing KE approaches, CKE emphasizes the iterative development of standalone, valid CBNs that encode causal mechanisms and can be shared/reused. Qualitative parameterization is used to validate CBN behavior.

- The paper provides practical guidance on the overall CKE workflow as well as recommendations for specific techniques to utilize at each stage (e.g. for expert elicitation, causal discovery, qualitative analysis).

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and demonstration of the CKE methodology for systematically developing a reusable qualitative causal knowledge base to support various downstream applications.

The paper discusses a knowledge engineering process called Causal Knowledge Engineering (CKE) that was used to develop causal Bayesian network models of various aspects of COVID-19, such as testing, diagnosis, and disease progression. The process involved extensive expert elicitation through methods like workshops and one-on-one sessions to capture evolving expert knowledge about the new disease. Key terms like Bayesian Networks, expert elicitation, knowledge engineering, causal knowledge engineering (CKE) and COVID-19 feature prominently throughout the paper in relation to the methodology and case study discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Causal Knowledge Engineering (CKE) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that CKE provides a structured approach for building a causal knowledge base to support various downstream applications. Can you elaborate on some of the key benefits of having such a causal knowledge base compared to directly building application-specific models?

2. One of the motivations mentioned for CKE is the ability to combine knowledge from experts, literature, data, and existing models. Can you discuss some of the challenges involved in integrating these diverse knowledge sources effectively? 

3. The paper talks about the concept of "inferable knowledge" that sits between direct and transferable knowledge. Can you provide some examples of how new causal knowledge can be inferred from combining direct and transferable knowledge?

4. In the description of roles involved, there is a "problem owner" role. What is the significance of this role and how does it differ from the "application lead"? 

5. The paper recommends starting with a top level framework that maps relationships between different CKBNs. What is the purpose of having this overarching framework and how can it aid the development process?

6. For developing individual CKBNs, qualitative parameterization is recommended as an optional step. What are some of the key benefits of doing this qualitative parameterization?

7. The elicitation workflow involves both group workshops and 1-on-1 sessions. What are some of the relative pros and cons of these two formats?

8. The paper talks about both structured and unstructured approaches to elicitation. Can you discuss why highly structured approaches may not work well for eliciting causal models? 

9. For literature review, the paper mentions "post-hoc confirmation/disconfirmation" of models. Can you elaborate why this approach has a risk of confirmation bias?

10. The technique catalog provides a useful overview of different methods. Can you compare and contrast some of the key structure development techniques like bow-tie, reverse bow-tie and expanding mediating pathways?
