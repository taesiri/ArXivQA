# [Role of Uncertainty in Anticipatory Trajectory Prediction for a   Ping-Pong Playing Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ping-pong robotics is challenging due to the high speed of the game requiring predictions to be made early to give the robot time to react. However, early predictions tend to be more uncertain. 
- Existing methods for ping-pong robots lack reliable uncertainty quantification associated with their anticipatory predictions. This limits their effectiveness in informing robot controllers on how much to rely on a prediction.
- Standard model uncertainty estimators often overestimate uncertainty, limiting robot movement. More reliable uncertainty measures are needed.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a visual modeling, prediction and control system for a ping-pong robot that utilizes uncertainty to inform controller movement speed throughout the game. 
- Predict post-hit ball trajectory parameters using RNN on time series of player pose, paddle pose and ball position leading up to the hit. Make first prediction 100ms before hit.
- Explore using model ensemble variance, conformal prediction and a time-to-hit based measure to quantify uncertainty. Use this to scale robot velocity towards predicted strike points.
- Test performance in a simulated environment with a robotic arm mounted on an omnidirectional base playing ping-pong. Compare different uncertainty-based controllers.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate benefit of incorporating model uncertainty into anticipatory controller in simulation. This allows earlier robot movement.
- Show limitations of standard uncertainty estimators in quantifying true model uncertainty through lack of correlation with error.
- Highlight need for more reliable and verifiable uncertainty estimators, using ping-pong as test environment. Performance improvement indicates usefulness.
- Release code and data to facilitate further research.

In summary, they develop a prediction and control system for a ping-pong robot that uses uncertainty to inform actions. They test various uncertainty estimators and find limitations in existing methods through simulations. They demonstrate the need for more reliable uncertainty quantification using the concrete example of ping-pong playing performance.
