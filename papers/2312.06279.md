# [Regional Correlation Aided Mobile Traffic Prediction with Spatiotemporal   Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06279)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an enhanced mobile traffic prediction framework that combines a novel clustering strategy based on peak traffic time similarity and a multi Temporal Convolutional Network with Long Short-Term Memory (multi TCN-LSTM) model. The clustering first groups cells by their peak traffic hour and then uses Pearson Correlation Coefficient to merge similar groups, reducing computation cost. The multi TCN-LSTM model adds residual convolutional connections to the standard TCN-LSTM to improve long-term dependency learning and prevent overfitting. Experiments using a large-scale Milan mobile traffic dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces Mean Absolute Percentage Error by 28% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results also show clustering improves performance of various models, highlighting its versatility, while the multi TCN-LSTM outperforms even without clustering. Overall, the proposed framework effectively exploits spatiotemporal characteristics in mobile traffic data for highly accurate prediction to support network planning and optimization.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent DL models for mobile traffic prediction have only exploited spatiotemporal features but ignored geographical correlations, causing high complexity and inaccurate predictions. 

Proposed Solution:
- A novel clustering strategy based on peak traffic times and Pearson correlation to group similar cells. This reduces complexity and improves prediction.
- A multi Temporal Convolutional Network with LSTM (multi TCN-LSTM) model with added residual connections to improve learning of complex spatiotemporal patterns.

Key Contributions:
- A peak traffic time based clustering method to classify regions and build separate prediction models per cluster. Improves understanding of traffic patterns.
- The multi TCN-LSTM model combines TCN's spatial modeling and LSTM's sequence modeling ability to capture intricate mobile traffic characteristics. 
- Residual connections enhance information flow between layers, resolving vanishing gradient issues.
- Evaluated on a large-scale Milan mobile traffic dataset. Achieves 28% lower error compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the paper proposes an enhanced mobile traffic prediction approach using a peak-time based clustering strategy and an improved multi TCN-LSTM model. Key innovations are the clustering method and the residual connected TCN-LSTM structure. Experiments demonstrate significant gains over existing techniques, confirming the efficacy of the solutions.
