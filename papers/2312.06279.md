# [Regional Correlation Aided Mobile Traffic Prediction with Spatiotemporal   Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06279)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an enhanced mobile traffic prediction framework that combines a novel clustering strategy based on peak traffic time similarity and a multi Temporal Convolutional Network with Long Short-Term Memory (multi TCN-LSTM) model. The clustering first groups cells by their peak traffic hour and then uses Pearson Correlation Coefficient to merge similar groups, reducing computation cost. The multi TCN-LSTM model adds residual convolutional connections to the standard TCN-LSTM to improve long-term dependency learning and prevent overfitting. Experiments using a large-scale Milan mobile traffic dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces Mean Absolute Percentage Error by 28% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results also show clustering improves performance of various models, highlighting its versatility, while the multi TCN-LSTM outperforms even without clustering. Overall, the proposed framework effectively exploits spatiotemporal characteristics in mobile traffic data for highly accurate prediction to support network planning and optimization.
