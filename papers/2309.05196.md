# [Does Writing with Language Models Reduce Content Diversity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05196)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Does writing with large language models reduce the diversity of content produced by users?

The authors hypothesize that incorporating suggestions from large language models like GPT-3 into a user's writing may "dilute the writer's unique voice", leading to more homogeneous content being produced when many users collaborate with the same underlying model. 

To test this hypothesis, the authors conduct a controlled experiment where groups of users are asked to write argumentative essays on various topics either without any AI assistance, with a base GPT-3 model, or with an instructGPT model that has been finetuned with human feedback. They then analyze the essays using a variety of diversity metrics to see if writing with the AI models results in less diverse content compared to writing without AI help.

So in summary, the central research question is whether using language models as collaborative writing assistants reduces the diversity of content produced by users, compared to humans writing alone without AI assistance. The authors hypothesize that it will reduce diversity due to the models influencing users to produce more homogeneous text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is measuring the impact of co-writing with large language models (LLMs) on the diversity of produced content. The authors conduct a controlled study where users write argumentative essays with either a base LLM (GPT-3), a feedback-tuned LLM (InstructGPT), or without any model assistance. They develop metrics to quantify content diversity at both the individual essay level (homogenization) and corpus level (overall diversity). 

The key findings are:

- Writing with InstructGPT results in increased homogenization - essays on the same topic become more similar compared to the control group. This effect is not observed with GPT-3.

- Writing with InstructGPT also reduces the overall diversity of content produced by the group of users. This manifests in decreased lexical diversity, increased repetition of common phrases, and lower diversity in the key points covered. Again, GPT-3 does not incur a significant reduction in diversity.

- The reduction in diversity is mainly attributed to less diverse text generated by InstructGPT, while the diversity of user-generated text remains largely unaffected by model collaboration.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that while recent gains in language model performance from human feedback come at the cost of generating more homogeneous content in co-writing settings, limiting content diversity and perspectives. The paper highlights the need to evaluate LLMs on this new axis of diversity in interactive applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether collaborative writing with large language models like GPT reduces diversity of content, finding that a feedback-tuned model decreases diversity more than an untuned model by contributing more homogeneous text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on evaluating language models in interactive settings:

- Focuses specifically on assessing content diversity rather than quality/engagement: Most prior work has looked at metrics like suggestion quality ratings, user engagement, etc. This paper takes the novel angle of evaluating the diversity of content produced when writing interactively with LMs. 

- Conducts a controlled user study for rigorous comparison: The authors design a nicely controlled between-subjects study with different conditions (LM types and no LM) to allow for clear comparisons on diversity metrics. Many related studies rely more on case studies or uncontrolled experiments.

- Develops new metrics tailored to diversity: Beyond standard n-gram diversity, the authors propose new metrics like key point clustering to capture diversity at the content level. This methodological contribution could be built upon in future work.

- Finds reduced diversity from a feedback-tuned LM: A key result is that diversity drops when using the feedback-tuned LM vs. the base LM or no LM. This highlights a potential downside of human feedback tuning that is not commonly discussed.

- Attributed effect mainly to less diverse LM generations: Analysis indicates that the user's text stays diverse but the LM text gets more homogeneous after feedback tuning. This sheds light on the source of reduced diversity.

Overall, the controlled study design, focus on diversity, and in-depth analysis of results move beyond most prior work to uncover a potential issue with feedback-tuned LMs reducing content diversity in collaborative writing. The paper makes both empirical and methodological contributions to the growing literature on evaluating LMs interactively.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop new evaluation methods to identify socio-technical issues when using large language models in user-facing applications. The authors suggest evaluating impacts on content diversity as one important axis.

- Study the dynamics of repeated human-AI co-writing interactions over time. This work focuses on single interactions, but the dynamics may change with prolonged use. 

- Mitigate the reduction in content diversity from human feedback tuning through prompt engineering or richer interaction forms like dialogues.

- Address the open problems in reinforcement learning from human feedback, such as handling diverse feedback from many users and personalizing generations to individuals.

- Analyze whether the results generalize to other user groups besides the online writers studied here, such as students or non-native speakers.

- Explore whether other language models exhibit similar effects on content diversity in co-writing. This study was limited to two specific models.

- Develop better evaluation metrics for interactive text generation beyond reference-based methods. The authors propose some content diversity metrics that could be extended.

In summary, the main suggestions are to further analyze the impacts of co-writing, develop more user-centered evaluations, and improve personalization when adapting models to human feedback. The released dataset is intended to facilitate research in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether writing with large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of content produced. Through a controlled experiment, the authors find that users writing argumentative essays with InstructGPT (a feedback-tuned LLM) produce more similar content compared to essays written with GPT3 (a base LLM) or without model assistance. Specifically, InstructGPT essays exhibit higher semantic similarity, increased repetition of n-grams, and lower uniqueness of key points. Further analysis reveals this effect is mainly attributable to InstructGPT contributing less diverse text, while user contributions remain unaffected. The results highlight a potential downside of recent improvements in LLM quality through human feedback adaptation, demonstrating reduced content diversity. Overall, the work measures the impact of LLM collaboration on diversity, finding that a feedback-tuned model leads to more homogeneous writing compared to an unmodified base model or no assistance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how writing collaboratively with large language models (LLMs) impacts the diversity of the content produced. The authors conduct a controlled study where users write argumentative essays with either no model assistance, a base LLM, or an LLM finetuned with human feedback. They analyze the essays using several metrics to measure diversity at the individual essay level and collectively across groups of essays. The key findings are that writing with the finetuned LLM results in more similar essays across different authors and lower overall lexical and content diversity compared to essays written without model assistance. In contrast, the base LLM does not significantly affect diversity. Further analysis indicates that the finetuned LLM provides less diverse suggestions itself, and incorporating these suggestions is the primary cause of reduced diversity. The authors highlight that improved quality from finetuning may have the unintended consequence of more homogeneous content. They suggest evaluating LLMs along this axis prior to deployment in writing assistance applications to mitigate risks of limiting perspectives and diversity.

In summary, this paper demonstrates through controlled experiments that collaborative writing with certain LLMs can reduce content diversity. Specifically, an LLM finetuned on human feedback generates less diverse suggestions, and incorporating these suggestions makes different authors write more similarly while reducing the overall diversity of content. The authors propose evaluating LLMs on content diversity in interactive settings and release their dataset to facilitate research in human-AI collaborative writing.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper conducts a controlled experiment to study the impact of large language models (LLMs) on content diversity in collaborative writing. The authors have users write argumentative essays on various topics in three settings: without model assistance, with a base LLM, and with a feedback-tuned LLM. They collect 100 essays per setting and analyze them using a variety of metrics to measure pairwise similarity between essays (homogenization) as well as overall diversity of the essay corpora. The main findings are that writing with the feedback-tuned LLM results in more similar essays between different users and lower overall diversity compared to essays written without model assistance or with just the base LLM. The effect seems to stem from the feedback-tuned LLM providing less diverse suggestions during the collaborative writing process.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are investigating is whether writing collaboratively with large language models reduces the diversity of content produced. Specifically, they examine:

- Whether users write more similarly to each other when assisted by LLMs - i.e. whether LLMs lead to homogenization of content between different users.

- Whether LLMs reduce the overall diversity of content produced by a group of users - i.e. whether the set of writings has lower lexical and content diversity. 

To study these questions, the authors conduct a controlled experiment where users write argumentative essays with and without the help of LLMs. They then analyze the essays using metrics they develop to quantify diversity at both the individual and collective level. Their key findings are:

- Writing with a feedback-tuned LLM results in users producing more similar content compared to writing alone or with a base LLM.

- The feedback-tuned LLM reduces lexical diversity and key point diversity compared to the other conditions. 

- The reduction in diversity is mainly due to the less diverse text generated by the feedback-tuned LLM rather than changes in user behavior.

Overall, the paper examines the important problem of whether reliance on LLMs for collaborative writing may unintentionally reduce the diversity of content produced, limiting personal expression and perspectives shared through public discourse.
