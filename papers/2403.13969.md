# ["This is not a data problem": Algorithms and Power in Public Higher   Education in Canada](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Higher education institutions (HEIs) are increasingly adopting data-driven practices and algorithmic decision-making systems. However, there is limited research on how these algorithms are designed, used in practice, and their impact within HEIs. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key research questions: (1) Why are student data-driven and algorithmic decision-making used in higher education? (2) How are data and algorithms currently designed, used and perceived by various HEI stakeholders?

Methodology:
The authors conducted an in-depth 4-month ethnographic case study at a public college in Ontario, Canada. They interviewed 33 key stakeholders across different roles, observed a data learning session, and analyzed documents and systems at the college. An inductive qualitative analysis was first done to understand emerging themes, followed by a deductive analysis using the ADMAPS framework to connect the findings to existing HCI theory.

Key Findings:
1) Data-driven and algorithmic practices are adopted in HEIs mainly to improve financial sustainability through better resource allocation, revenue forecasting, and potential commercialization. 

2) These practices lead to increased surveillance, exacerbation of inequities, and automation of faculty-student relationships. Students lose agency while institutions gain more control.

3) The analysis revealed a cycle called the ASP-HEI cycle, where the prioritization of financial sustainability drives increased use of algorithms and student data, which alters institutional relationships and impacts students, further increasing institutional power. This cycle perpetuates existing power imbalances between institutions and students.

Main Contributions:
1) Provides an in-depth empirical analysis of how data and algorithms are designed, used and perceived within a public HEI.

2) Identifies the ASP-HEI cycle that explains the complex interdependencies between external policies, data practices, institutional relationships and impact on students.

3) Discusses design implications for developing more human-centered and holistic algorithmic decision-making systems in public higher education.

The paper makes important theoretical and practical contributions towards understanding and improving the responsible use of algorithms in higher education institutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an ethnographic case study of data and algorithmic practices at a public college in Canada, uncovering a cycle of heightened institutional power driven by financial pressures and enabled through increased student surveillance, inequality, and automation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper uncovers a recurring pattern called the "ASP-HEI Cycle" (Algorithms, Student Data, and Power in Higher Education Institutions) which shows how the prioritization of financial sustainability drives the adoption of data-driven and algorithmic practices in higher education institutions (HEIs). These practices lead to increased surveillance of students, exacerbation of existing inequities, and automation of the faculty/student relationship, which ultimately serves to heighten institutional power. The paper provides an empirical, qualitative analysis to reveal this cycle based on an in-depth ethnographic case study of a public college in Canada.

In summary, the key contribution is the conceptualization and evidence behind the ASP-HEI Cycle, which shows how algorithmic decision-making and student data practices alter relationships within an HEI and impact students, while reinforcing existing power dynamics and priorities like financial sustainability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Human-Centered Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Higher Education
- Learning Analytics
- Algorithmic Decision-Making
- Student Data
- Institutional Power
- Financial Sustainability
- Resource Allocation
- Enrollment Prediction
- Early Alert System
- Bias
- Discrimination
- Surveillance
- Deficit-based Models
- Automation
- Faculty-Student Relationship

These keywords capture many of the main topics, concepts, and issues discussed in relation to the use of algorithms and student data in higher education institutions. The paper examines things like the goals and outcomes associated with algorithmic systems, the processes and perceptions around them, their impacts on students and institutional power dynamics. So the keywords cover this breadth of focus.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper employs an ethnographic case study method. Why was this qualitative approach selected over other methods like surveys or experiments? What are the strengths and weaknesses of using an ethnographic case study for this research?

2. Thirty-three participants across various roles were interviewed. How were these participants sampled and recruited? What steps were taken to ensure a diverse range of perspectives were included? 

3. The paper mentions obtaining both REB approval from the research institution and the research site. What ethical considerations had to be addressed in the research design due to the author being a full-time employee at the site?

4. Inductive coding of transcripts was first conducted before applying the ADMAPS framework deductively. What was the rationale behind using this hybrid inductive-deductive approach? How might the findings have differed with a purely deductive coding process?

5. The ASP-HEI cycle model is a key contribution. Walk through the process of how this model emerged from the data. What other theoretical lenses were considered when interpreting the qualitative data?

6. The paper focuses solely on algorithms designed and trained by the college's data team. What limitations might there be in the findings by not exploring third-party algorithmic tools used at the college? 

7. Financial sustainability is identified as a driver of increased reliance on algorithms. How could the researchers further test the applicability of the ASP-HEI cycle model to other institutions not facing austerity measures?  

8. What validation strategies were used to evaluate the credibility of the findings and ASP-HEI model? How could the model be further refined and tested through future research?

9. The first author is an employee of the research site. What reflexivity processes were used to examine how this role may have shaped the data collection and analysis? 

10. The paper argues the increased use of algorithms leads to a loss of student agency. What philosophical perspectives or theoretical groundings guided this viewpoint on the ethical dimensions of algorithm usage?
