# ["This is not a data problem": Algorithms and Power in Public Higher   Education in Canada](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Higher education institutions (HEIs) are increasingly adopting data-driven practices and algorithmic decision-making systems. However, there is limited research on how these algorithms are designed, used in practice, and their impact within HEIs. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key research questions: (1) Why are student data-driven and algorithmic decision-making used in higher education? (2) How are data and algorithms currently designed, used and perceived by various HEI stakeholders?

Methodology:
The authors conducted an in-depth 4-month ethnographic case study at a public college in Ontario, Canada. They interviewed 33 key stakeholders across different roles, observed a data learning session, and analyzed documents and systems at the college. An inductive qualitative analysis was first done to understand emerging themes, followed by a deductive analysis using the ADMAPS framework to connect the findings to existing HCI theory.

Key Findings:
1) Data-driven and algorithmic practices are adopted in HEIs mainly to improve financial sustainability through better resource allocation, revenue forecasting, and potential commercialization. 

2) These practices lead to increased surveillance, exacerbation of inequities, and automation of faculty-student relationships. Students lose agency while institutions gain more control.

3) The analysis revealed a cycle called the ASP-HEI cycle, where the prioritization of financial sustainability drives increased use of algorithms and student data, which alters institutional relationships and impacts students, further increasing institutional power. This cycle perpetuates existing power imbalances between institutions and students.

Main Contributions:
1) Provides an in-depth empirical analysis of how data and algorithms are designed, used and perceived within a public HEI.

2) Identifies the ASP-HEI cycle that explains the complex interdependencies between external policies, data practices, institutional relationships and impact on students.

3) Discusses design implications for developing more human-centered and holistic algorithmic decision-making systems in public higher education.

The paper makes important theoretical and practical contributions towards understanding and improving the responsible use of algorithms in higher education institutions.
