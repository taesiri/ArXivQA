# [Don't Take It Literally: An Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss for Text   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15078)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop an edit-invariant sequence loss function for text generation that is robust to minor edits in the target sequence?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new loss function called EISL (Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss) for text generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and grammatical error correction. 

- Existing sequence loss functions like cross-entropy treat any change in the target sequence as a mistake. But minor edits like rephrasing or synonym substitution should not be heavily penalized.

- EISL aims to make the loss function more robust to such minor edits in the target sequence. It does this by minimizing the edit distance between the generated and target sequences, allowing for small edits.

- The edit distance is efficiently approximated using a learned edit proposal distribution and importance sampling.

- Experiments across the three tasks show EISL improves performance over cross-entropy and other recent robust losses. The generated sequences better preserve the meaning while allowing small edits.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that an edit-invariant loss will improve text generation by avoiding over-penalization of minor target edits. EISL is proposed to achieve such a loss in an efficient way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new loss function called the edit-invariant sequence loss for text generation tasks. The key ideas are:

- They design an edit-invariant distance to measure the similarity between two sequences robust to token-level edits like insertion, deletion, and replacement. This distance is based on the shortest edit path between two sequences.

- They incorporate this edit-invariant distance into a new sequence loss function for training text generation models like neural machine translation and text summarization. 

- The new loss function encourages the model to generate sequences that preserve the original meaning even with small edits, rather than forcing the model to reproduce the exact target sequence.

- They demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss on machine translation, summarization, and parsing tasks. Using the edit-invariant loss improves performance over standard likelihood training and other sequence losses.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel training loss for text generation that is robust to small token edits in the target sequence. This improves the meaning preservation and overall quality of generated texts. The edit-invariant sequence loss provides a new way to bridge the gap between training targets and desired outputs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new sequence loss function called EISL (Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss) for text generation that is robust to edits in the target sequence, enabling more efficient training on noisy data like machine translated text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper proposes a new edit-invariant sequence loss function for text generation. Most prior work has focused on sequence losses like cross-entropy that maximize likelihood, but these are not robust to unnecessary edits in the target text. So this work addresses an important limitation.

- The proposed loss function builds on ideas from prior work on edit-sensitive losses, like Levenshtein distance or TER. However, it simplifies these approaches to operate on token edits rather than character edits, making it more efficient and suitable for neural text generation models.

- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across three text generation tasks - summarization, translation, and dialogue - when using the proposed loss. This shows it is widely applicable. The gains are especially significant for noisy target tasks like translation with crawled data.

- The comparison to other related losses like TER and hamming distance loss shows the benefits of the proposed method. The ablation studies also provide insight into the importance of different components of the approach.

- The work fits into the broader trend of revisiting core building blocks like objectives for seq2seq learning. The results show edit invariance is an important inductive bias. This principle could likely be integrated into other generation models.

Overall, I think this paper makes a nice contribution in proposing a simple but effective edit-invariant objective. It is grounded in prior work but shows clear benefits across diverse text generation problems. The results convincingly demonstrate the value of edit invariance as an inductive bias for robust sequence learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Exploring other edit-invariant objectives beyond sequence loss, such as syntax scoring and generation metrics. They believe edit invariance is a generally desirable property.

- Applying the edit-invariant loss to other conditional text generation tasks beyond machine translation, such as summarization and dialog.

- Extending the method to make it robust to semantic-preserving edits like paraphrasing. Currently it is only invariant to surface form edits.

- Developing methods that are approximately edit-invariant while remaining efficient to compute, as the exact edit-invariant loss can be computationally expensive.

- Studying the theoretical connections between edit invariance and generalization. The authors hypothesize edit invariance may lead to better generalization by aligning the loss more closely with human judgements.

- Developing edit-invariant pretrained models and studying their effectiveness on downstream tasks compared to models trained with standard loss functions.

So in summary, the main future directions are applying edit invariance more broadly, scaling it to large datasets, approximating the invariance efficiently, theoretically analyzing it, and leveraging it for pretraining.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper proposes a new loss function called Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL) for text generation tasks. The key idea is to make the loss function invariant to semantically equivalent edits in the generated text. Specifically, EISL optimizes the model to generate text that has high semantic similarity to the ground truth, even if it does not exactly match at the token level. 

The authors first define an edit transducer that transforms the candidate text into semantically equivalent versions. The edit transducer performs operations like synonym replacement, paraphrasing,reorderings etc. EISL then minimizes the negative log-likelihood between the ground truth and the edited candidate text. 

Experiments on summarization, translation and image captioning show EISL leads to improved performance compared to cross-entropy and other losses. EISL also enables training with noisy data, where the ground truth itself may contain edits. Overall, by optimizing for semantic similarity rather than exact token match, EISL generates more diverse, fluent and accurate text.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new loss function called the Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL) for text generation. The key idea is to make the loss invariant to small edits in the generated text compared to the ground truth text. This avoids penalizing valid generations that differ only slightly from the ground truth. 

The EISL works by comparing the edit distance between generated and ground truth text, and scaling the loss based on this distance. The closer the generated text is to the ground truth in terms of edits, the lower the loss. This encourages the model to generate text that captures the overall meaning while allowing small variations. The authors demonstrate EISL on three tasks: machine translation, text summarization, and grammatical error correction. Experiments show improved performance compared to cross-entropy and other losses across various metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and GLEU. The results illustrate that optimizing directly for edit invariance helps generate more fluent, accurate, and diverse text. Overall, EISL provides a simple but effective way to improve text generation through an edit-invariant loss.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new edit-invariant sequence loss called Don't Take It Literally (DTI-L) for text generation. DTI-L encourages the model to learn semantic similarity rather than literal token match between the generated text and ground truth. It first obtains sentence embeddings for the generated and ground truth sentences using a frozen pretrained BERT model. It then defines the loss as the mean squared error between these sentence embeddings. By operating on semantic sentence embeddings rather than exact token match, the loss provides more flexibility for the model to generate semantically similar outputs using different words and phrasings. This invariance to edits makes the loss more robust to noise in the training data and allows the model to generate more diverse outputs. Experiments on summarization, translation, and image captioning tasks demonstrate improved performance over standard token-matching loss functions like cross-entropy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem of developing a loss function for text generation that is invariant to minor edits in the target text. Specifically, it proposes a new loss function called the Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL). The key ideas are:

- Standard likelihood losses like cross-entropy penalize a model if its generated text differs from the target text, even by small edits like paraphrasing or changes in word order. This makes training inefficient. 

- EISL aims to be invariant to such minor edits, so that the model is not heavily penalized for small variations from the target. It does this by comparing the model output against a set of edited versions of the target, rather than just the one target sequence.

- The edited targets are generated by simple rules like paraphrasing, shuffling words, and deleting/inserting words. The loss computes similarity against this edited set rather than just the original target.

- This provides a smoother training signal and improves sample efficiency. Experiments show EISL improves performance on text generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and dialogue.

In summary, the paper proposes a new training loss that is robust to minor edits in the target text, for more efficient and effective learning for text generation models. The core idea is comparing against edited versions of the target during training.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper presents a new loss function called Expected Interval Sequence Loss (EISL) for sequence generation tasks like machine translation and text summarization. EISL matches target phrases of n-grams rather than individual tokens to improve robustness. It calculates the probability of generating the target phrase in any possible interval of the output sequence, instead of relying on strict token-level alignment like cross-entropy loss. Experiments on noisy machine translation, text style transfer, and non-autoregressive translation show that EISL substantially outperforms cross-entropy and policy gradient methods. EISL improves performance on clean data and is much more robust to noisy targets. The method conceptually connects to BLEU metric and maximum expected BLEU training. EISL also enables more efficient training for non-autoregressive models. Overall, the proposed EISL loss provides a simple but effective way to improve sequence generation through better matching that is robust to noise and uncertainty in the target sequences.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Extended Importance Sampled Learning (EISL), a new learning objective for training deep neural networks. EISL addresses the problems with standard cross-entropy loss, which can be sensitive to noise and lead to exposure bias during training. The key idea of EISL is to match n-gram statistics between the model distribution and target, rather than maximizing token-level likelihood. This makes the loss more robust to noise and better suited for non-autoregressive models. The paper shows connections between EISL and objectives like BLEU. Through experiments on machine translation, style transfer, and non-autoregressive generation, EISL is shown to substantially improve performance over cross-entropy and other methods. The results demonstrate EISL's effectiveness at learning from noisy data and weak supervision across diverse tasks and models. The approximation method also makes EISL efficient to implement. Overall, EISL provides a simple yet effective objective to train better deep generative models.
