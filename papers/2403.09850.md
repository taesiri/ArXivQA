# [MARVIS: Motion &amp; Geometry Aware Real and Virtual Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09850)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tasks like navigation, 3D reconstruction, and object recognition are crucial for marine robots but challenging near water surfaces due to image distortions from reflections, refractions, etc. which create virtual image regions. 
- Differentiating between real and virtual image regions is difficult for traditional computer vision algorithms.
- Lack of datasets and annotation tools make real-world data collection costly and labor intensive. 

Proposed Solution - AquaSim Simulator and MARVIS Network
- AquaSim simulator uses Blender to generate realistic synthetic maritime datasets with corresponding ground truth segmentation masks. Allows customization of various parameters like water color, waves, reflections etc.

- MARVIS network incorporates temporal information and epipolar geometric constraints for robust real-virtual image segmentation:
  - Proposes Local Motion Entropy (LME) kernel to capture chaotic motions in virtual regions vs smooth motions in real regions.
  - Imposes epipolar geometric consistency (EGC) loss for stereo image pairs.
  - Lightweight encoder-decoder network architecture with skip connections and attention modules.

- Trained only on synthetic data, MARVIS generalizes well to real-world data without needing retraining due to use of domain-invariant LME and EGC features.

Key Contributions:
- AquaSim simulator to generate diverse photorealistic synthetic maritime datasets with ground truth segmentation masks.
- MARVIS network with LME and EGC for state-of-the-art real-virtual segmentation performance in both synthetic (IoU 94%) and real-world (IoU 78%) settings. 
- Demonstrates feasibility of simulator-based training for maritime applications.
- Fast inference capability on resource constrained autonomous vehicles.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called MARVIS for segmenting real and virtual image regions near water surfaces by exploiting synthetic images, domain-invariant motion and geometry information, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) AquaSim, an underwater simulator tailored for generating realistic synthetic datasets with corresponding ground truth masks to train neural networks for real-virtual image segmentation near water surfaces.

2) MARVIS, a novel and efficient pipeline for real-virtual image segmentation that incorporates temporal information and epipolar geometric constraints. Key components include:

- Local Motion Entropy (LME) kernel to capture consistent motion patterns across frames as a robust temporal feature.

- Epipolar Geometric Consistency (EGC) loss for weak supervision when stereo imagery is available, based on the violation of the epipolar constraint by virtual images.

3) Comprehensive experiments showing MARVIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-virtual image segmentation on both synthetic (IoU 94%, F1 96%) and real-world datasets (IoU 78%, F1 86%). It also runs efficiently with only 2.56M parameters and over 43 FPS on a GPU.

4) Demonstration of AquaSim and MARVIS advancing autonomous navigation and perception for marine robots near water surfaces by effectively differentiating real vs. virtual image regions.
