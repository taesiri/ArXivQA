# [Neural paraphrasing by automatically crawled and aligned sentence pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Paraphrasing is the task of rewriting a text using different words/phrases while preserving its meaning. It is useful for conversational systems to make interactions more natural.
- Most existing paraphrasing systems use rule-based models. Recent advances in deep learning motivate exploring neural network models for paraphrasing. 
- However, large datasets of aligned sentence-paraphrase pairs needed to train neural models are lacking, especially for non-English languages. Creating such datasets manually is expensive and difficult to scale up.

Proposed Solution:
- Present an automated method to create large aligned corpora for paraphrasing based on the idea that news/blog sites report the same events in different styles.
- Method involves: focused web crawling, NLP-based linguistic analysis, constrained similarity search to find paraphrase candidates and filtering.
- Apply method to generate 85K aligned pairs in Italian from 1M sentences extracted from 86K articles.
- Train pointer-based sequence-to-sequence neural network on this dataset for paraphrasing.

Main Contributions:
- Automated pipeline to construct large datasets of aligned sentence-paraphrase pairs from news/blog articles to train neural paraphrasing models.
- Method is language-agnostic. Currently implemented for Italian resulting in 85K pairs. 
- Analysis of feasibility of using such automatically constructed datasets to train neural models for paraphrasing.
- Report improved ROUGE scores for pointer network over plain sequence-to-sequence model.

Future Work:
- Continue expanding the Italian dataset. Also apply approach to construct English dataset.
- Incorporate more knowledge into paraphrase generation using learning from constraints approaches.
- Explore online learning settings for paraphrasing.
