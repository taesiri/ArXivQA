# [Non-Autoregressive Predictive Coding for Learning Speech Representations   from Local Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00406)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn effective speech representations in a more efficient, non-autoregressive manner relying only on local dependencies in the speech signal. The key points are:- Existing methods like CPC, APC, and MLM rely on autoregressive models and/or global dependencies to learn speech representations. This makes them inefficient due to inability to parallelize and complexity related to sequence length. - The proposed method, Non-Autoregressive Predictive Coding (NPC), learns speech representations without autoregression and using only local dependencies within a fixed context window. This allows parallelization and inference time independent of sequence length.- NPC uses a simple predictive coding objective, where each frame is predicted from its local context window after masking the target itself. This is implemented via introduced Masked Convolutional Blocks.- Experiments show NPC provides significant speedups while achieving representation quality comparable to previous methods on phonetic and speaker classification tasks.- Analysis of learned model weights confirms NPC relies primarily on local context, supporting the design.In summary, the central hypothesis is that non-autoregressive modeling with local context is sufficient for learning effective and efficient speech representations. The NPC method and experiments support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a self-supervised method called Non-Autoregressive Predictive Coding (NPC) to learn speech representations efficiently. The key points are:- NPC learns speech representations in a non-autoregressive manner, only relying on local context instead of global dependencies. This allows parallelization during inference and makes the running time constant regardless of input length. - NPC has a simple objective of reconstructing the current frame from surrounding context frames. Masked convolution blocks are introduced to prevent the model from directly copying the target frame.- Experiments show NPC representations are comparable to prior work in phonetic/speaker classification, while being significantly faster. Theoretical analysis and empirical measurements demonstrate the efficiency advantages.- Analysis of the learned model provides insights into how NPC relies on local context, with frames closest to the target having the highest importance.In summary, the main contribution is proposing NPC as a fast and simple self-supervised method to learn speech representations by only relying on local dependencies instead of autoregressive or global modeling. The efficiency benefits are demonstrated while maintaining competitive performance on representation quality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes Non-Autoregressive Predictive Coding (NPC), a self-supervised method for learning speech representations from only local dependencies of the speech signal in a non-autoregressive manner, which is faster and more parallelizable compared to prior autoregressive and globally dependent methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on learning speech representations:- This paper proposes Non-Autoregressive Predictive Coding (NPC) as a novel self-supervised method for learning speech representations. It differs from prior work like Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC) in that it does not rely on autoregressive models or global sequence dependencies. - A key contribution is showing speech representations can be learned using only local context, rather than full sequence context. This is done by restricting the model to only observe local neighborhoods around each time step during training.- The proposed NPC method is shown to be much more efficient than prior work. It has a fixed computational complexity per time step, unlike autoregressive models. Empirically it is 29-72x faster than methods like CPC, APC, and masked language modeling.- In terms of effectiveness, NPC produces representations comparable to prior work for phonetic and speaker classification tasks. The tradeoff is it may not capture global sequence dependencies as well. But the results suggest the local context is sufficient for many representation learning objectives.- Overall, this work shows local context modeling is viable for self-supervised speech representation learning. NPC offers a simple but efficient alternative to prominent approaches like CPC and APC. The analysis provides insights into local versus global dependencies for different speech tasks.In summary, the key distinction is showing local-only context modeling can work for speech, when prior work relied more on global context. The proposed NPC method offers much faster representation learning as a result.
