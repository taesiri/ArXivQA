# [Learning to Learn Faster from Human Feedback with Language Model   Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11450)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Large language models (LLMs) like PaLM can generate robot code from natural language instructions to make robots learn new behaviors rapidly through in-context learning. However, this adaptation is limited to short-term interactions where previous instructions can be forgotten over longer conversations. The paper aims to improve the "teachability" of LLMs, defined as how efficiently they adapt to human feedback to successfully complete tasks. 

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces Language Model Predictive Control (LMPC), which combines in-context learning with LLM fine-tuning. During the day, non-experts teach new behaviors to robots through natural language feedback, enabling fast adaptation via in-context learning. At night, the LLM is fine-tuned on the collected interaction data to "remember" and improve adaptation. Formulating the interactions as a POMDP, LMPC trains the LLM to model human-robot chat dynamics and uses model predictive control at inference for faster search to task success.

Key Contributions:

- LMPC framework to fine-tune LLMs with human-robot conversation data to improve teachability

- Achieves 26.9% higher success rates on unseen tasks with fewer corrections (from 2.4 to 1.9 on average)

- Identifies top-performing users automatically and shows conditioning on them during LMPC rollouts further improves performance 

- Demonstrates strong generalization - improvements transfer to new unseen robot platforms and APIs

- Extensive experiments with 5 robot platforms, 78 tasks, and non-expert users show consistently improved teachability over base LLMs and retrieval methods

In summary, the paper presents LMPC to make large language models more efficiently adaptable to human feedback over longer interactions when teaching robot behaviors. Both offline LLM fine-tuning and online adaptation are combined in a mutually improving cycle.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Language Model Predictive Control (LMPC), a framework that improves the teachability of large language models for writing robot code by combining fast adaptation via in-context learning with users and slow adaptation via model fine-tuning to better respond to multi-turn natural language feedback for directing robot behaviors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Language Model Predictive Control (LMPC) to improve the teachability of large language models (LLMs) for writing robot code based on natural language feedback from non-expert humans. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Formulating the human-robot interaction as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), with human text inputs as observations and robot code outputs as actions.

2) Training the LLM to model the dynamics of this POMDP by predicting full trajectories of human-robot interactions. This is done through supervised finetuning.

3) Using the finetuned LLM together with model predictive control (MPC) during inference to search for shorter paths to task success. MPC allows the model to imagine and evaluate multiple possible futures.

4) Conditioning the model on high-performing "top users" to improve teachability for all users.

Experiments showed that LMPC improves task success rates and reduces the number of corrections needed from non-expert humans over a baseline model and retrieval-based method. The improvements generalized to unseen tasks and robot platforms.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Teachability - The efficiency of adapting to human feedback, measured by number of corrections needed before task success. Improving teachability is a key goal.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Used as the base model that is adapted via in-context learning and fine-tuning. Specifically, they use PaLM 2.

- In-context learning - Fast online adaptation by conditioning the LLM on interaction history and prompts. Enables real-time human-robot teaching. 

- Fine-tuning - Slow offline adaptation by updating model weights, in this case using Language Model Predictive Control (LMPC). Improves future in-context learning.

- LMPC - Formulates interaction as a POMDP and trains LLM to model transitions. Uses model predictive control and rollouts at inference for search.

- Top-user conditioning - Identifies best human teachers and conditions generations on their style. Improves performance for all users.  

- Robot embodiments - 5 platforms across simulation and real robots used for evaluation, including a quadruped, mobile manipulator, two robot arms, and a dexterous hand.

So in summary, key ideas involve leveraging LLMs, in-context learning and LMPC fine-tuning to improve interactive teachability across diverse robot platforms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method of Language Model Predictive Control (LMPC) allow leveraging both in-context learning and fine-tuning to improve language model teachability? What are the relative advantages and limitations of each approach on their own?

2. The paper proposes conditioning the LMPC rollouts on top-performing "top users" during training and inference. What is the intuition behind this and what kinds of improvements does it lead to? How sensitive are the results to the threshold used to identify top users?

3. The paper compares two variants of LMPC: LMPC-Rollouts and LMPC-Skip. What are the key differences in how these methods are trained and used at inference time? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses?

4. How does the paper's formulation of human-robot interaction as a POMDP enable using classic techniques like model predictive control? What assumptions does this make and what are its limitations?

5. How suitable is the proposed approach for real-time interaction given the computational requirements? What tradeoffs were made (e.g. model quantization) and what scope is there for improvement?

6. The paper demonstrates cross-embodiment generalization to new unseen robot platforms. What factors enable this? How far can we expect this generalization capability to extend to truly novel embodiments?

7. What additional failure modes beyond those analyzed could occur when deploying the approach proposed here to real complex environments? How can the approach be made more robust?

8. The paper does not find additional gains from further iterative fine-tuning. What reasons or hypotheses are provided for this? How can we adapt the framework to unlock further iterative improvements? 

9. What range of tasks does the paper's evaluation cover and what are its limitations? What more complex tasks would stretch the capabilities of the current approach?

10. The paper focuses narrowly on reward function code as the interface between natural language instructions and robot control. What other interfaces could enable richer human feedback and behavior specification?
