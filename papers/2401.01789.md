## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Accurately estimating parameters like the Hurst exponent is critical for stochastic models used across finance, reliability engineering etc. Small errors can cause major discrepancies.
