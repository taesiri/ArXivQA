# [Accelerated Event-Based Feature Detection and Compression for   Surveillance Video Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08213)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes extensions to the Address, Decimation, Î”t Event Representation (ADDER) framework for efficiently representing surveillance video with asynchronous events. The authors introduce modifications like absolute timestamping, adaptive contrast thresholds, and a constant rate factor to improve the quality and compression friendliness of ADDER. They then propose a multifaceted lossy compression scheme for ADDER using intra- and inter-coding of events, packetized scrubbing, and context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding, achieving 2.5:1 compression ratios. The authors also implement an asynchronous version of the FAST feature detector that leverages the sparsity of the ADDER representation and integrates it into the compression loop to preserve quality near detected features. Evaluated on the VIRAT dataset, their system achieves higher quality around moving objects and up to 43.7% faster feature detection compared to standard frame-based pipelines. The work shows the promise of asynchronous event-based paradigms to enable faster and more efficient computer vision applications.
