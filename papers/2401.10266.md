Problem:
Condition monitoring plays a critical role in ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of modern industrial systems. With large amounts of sensor data available from industrial plants, there is growing interest in utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for intelligent condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research comparing different deep learning algorithms and their performance for this task, especially using a standardized benchmark case study.

Proposed Solution:

The open-source Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) simulator is used as a case study for fair algorithm comparison. The paper summarizes the most popular deep learning methods like CNNs, RNNs, autoencoders, GANs, and attention models that have shown success for industrial fault diagnosis. A comparative analysis is provided by evaluating different methods on the TEP benchmark.

Key Contributions:

- Comprehensive literature review of intelligent condition monitoring methods and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms applied to industrial plants

- Side-by-side comparison of various neural network architectures based on a standardized TEP case study, using consistent evaluation metrics 

- Analysis of real-world challenges like imbalanced/unlabeled data and model interpretability, along with potential solutions 

- Valuable insights for both new and expert researchers on deep learning advancements for industrial condition monitoring

- Discussion of new research frontiers like ensemble learning, explainable AI, and causal AI to enhance monitoring system robustness and trustworthiness

In summary, this paper significantly advances the field by extensively reviewing and benchmarking intelligent condition monitoring techniques, providing both theoretical and practical knowledge to transition these methods into industry.
