# [Tractable Local Equilibria in Non-Concave Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classical game theory relies on utilities/losses being concave, but modern ML applications like GANs and MARL often involve non-concave losses.
- In non-concave games, Nash equilibria and common solution concepts may not exist, have infinite representation, or are intractable to find.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new solution concept called $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium, which is a distribution over joint strategy profiles such that no player can gain more than $\varepsilon$ utility by applying any strategy modification in $\Phi^{\X_i}(\delta)$.
- Instantiate this concept for two types of local strategy modifications:
    1. $\Phi_{\Int,\Psi}^{\X}(\delta)$: Interpolations between current strategy and modifications suggested by $\psi \in \Psi$.
    2. $\Phi_{\Proj}^{\X}(\delta)$: Fixed direction deviations projected back onto feasible set.
- Show online learning algorithms like OGD that minimize corresponding notions of $\Phi$-regret converge efficiently to these local equilibria.

Main Contributions:
- A new, general framework for defining local equilibria in non-concave games based on limiting incentive to deviate under local strategy modifications.
- Efficient algorithms and dynamics (OGD) converging to two natural instantiations capturing guarantees for no-regret learning in non-concave settings.  
- Hardness results showing intractability in the global regime even with correlation.
- Illustration that OGD is not universally applicable by constructing a local equilibrium notion where it fails.

The paper makes significant progress towards developing a meaningful and computationally tractable theory of non-concave games using local correlated equilibria.
