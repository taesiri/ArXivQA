# [Tractable Local Equilibria in Non-Concave Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08171)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classical game theory relies on utilities/losses being concave, but modern ML applications like GANs and MARL often involve non-concave losses.
- In non-concave games, Nash equilibria and common solution concepts may not exist, have infinite representation, or are intractable to find.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new solution concept called $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium, which is a distribution over joint strategy profiles such that no player can gain more than $\varepsilon$ utility by applying any strategy modification in $\Phi^{\X_i}(\delta)$.
- Instantiate this concept for two types of local strategy modifications:
    1. $\Phi_{\Int,\Psi}^{\X}(\delta)$: Interpolations between current strategy and modifications suggested by $\psi \in \Psi$.
    2. $\Phi_{\Proj}^{\X}(\delta)$: Fixed direction deviations projected back onto feasible set.
- Show online learning algorithms like OGD that minimize corresponding notions of $\Phi$-regret converge efficiently to these local equilibria.

Main Contributions:
- A new, general framework for defining local equilibria in non-concave games based on limiting incentive to deviate under local strategy modifications.
- Efficient algorithms and dynamics (OGD) converging to two natural instantiations capturing guarantees for no-regret learning in non-concave settings.  
- Hardness results showing intractability in the global regime even with correlation.
- Illustration that OGD is not universally applicable by constructing a local equilibrium notion where it fails.

The paper makes significant progress towards developing a meaningful and computationally tractable theory of non-concave games using local correlated equilibria.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new local equilibrium concept for non-concave games that captures the convergence guarantees of no-regret learning dynamics like online gradient descent, proves the concept is efficiently computable for certain natural classes of local deviations, and establishes hardness results when the locality parameter is large.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the study of non-concave games and local equilibrium concepts:

1. It proposes a new general notion of local equilibrium called $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium, which relaxes the incentive guarantees of local Nash equilibrium using correlated deviations bounded by $\delta$. This provides a spectrum of local equilibrium concepts with tunable incentive guarantees.

2. It shows that two natural instantiations of this local equilibrium concept, based on interpolation and projection modifications, can be efficiently computed using no-regret learning algorithms like online gradient descent. 

3. It establishes computational hardness results showing that finding these local equilibria remains intractable in the global regime when $\delta$ is large. 

4. It provides regret analysis showing that simple learning algorithms like online gradient descent can attain near optimal regret for certain local modification sets like the projection-based ones, despite external regret and such local regret being fundamentally different.

In summary, the paper proposes meaningful, universal and tractable local equilibrium concepts for non-concave games, establishes positive algorithmic results for computing such equilibria, and negative hardness results delineating the limits of tractability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Non-concave games: Games where players' utility functions are not necessarily concave in their own strategies. This is a key focus of the paper.

- Local equilibria: Relaxed equilibrium concepts that provide local instead of global stability guarantees. The paper proposes notions like $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium. 

- Tractability: A goal of the paper is to develop equilibrium concepts for non-concave games that are computationally tractable.

- Online/no-regret learning: The paper shows how no-regret learning procedures like online gradient descent can converge to the proposed local equilibrium concepts.

- Correlation: The proposed local equilibrium concepts introduce correlation among players' strategies to help circumvent computational intractability. 

- Regret minimization: The paper connects the computation of local equilibria to online regret minimization against sequence of losses.

- Smooth games: The paper focuses on differentiable games with Lipschitz and smooth utility functions.

So in summary, key terms cover notions of local equilibria, tractability guarantees, no-regret learning, correlation, smooth games, etc. in the context of analyzing non-concave multi-player games.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new solution concept called $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium. How does this concept generalize/relate to prior notions like local Nash equilibrium and correlated equilibrium? What new kinds of incentive guarantees does it provide?

2. Two specific instantiations of the $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium concept are proposed based on interpolation ($\Phi_{\mathrm{Int}}$) and projection ($\Phi_{\mathrm{Proj}}$). What are the key differences between these two notions? When would one be preferred over the other?

3. The paper shows a reduction from computing an $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibrium to minimizing $\Phi$-regret against convex loss functions. What is the intuition behind this reduction and why does it hold? What limitations does it have?

4. For the interpolation-based notion, the paper further reduces $\Phi^\X_{\mathrm{Int}}$-regret minimization to external regret minimization. Why does this reduction work and what are its implications? Does a similar reduction hold for the projection-based notion?

5. The projection-based notion $\Phi_{\mathrm{Proj}}$ is shown to be fundamentally different from external regret. What examples illustrate this difference? Why does it make the regret minimization problem more challenging?

6. Despite the differences, online gradient descent is shown to attain near optimal $\Phi_{\mathrm{Proj}}$-regret. What is the key insight that enables the novel analysis showing this? How tight are the bounds obtained?

7. In the game setting, why does using optimistic gradient descent allow obtaining an improved $\Phi_{\mathrm{Proj}}$-regret compared to standard gradient descent? What assumption about the game's structure makes this possible?

8. For the beam search notion $\Phi_{\mathrm{Beam}}$, gradient descent is shown to suffer linear regret. What is the intuition for why GD fails in this case? What kinds of algorithms could minimize this notion of regret?

9. The paper shows hardness for finding $(\varepsilon, \Phi(\delta))$-local equilibria in the global regime. What is the core idea behind these hardness results? What do they imply about the limits of using correlation to tractably compute meaningful equilibria?

10. What are the most interesting open questions raised by this work? What kinds of extensions of the method seem worthwhile to explore further in future work?
