# [High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimisation with Large-Scale Constraints --   An Application to Aeroelastic Tailoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08891)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach to tackle high-dimensional Bayesian optimization problems with a large number of constraints, a setting common in engineering design optimizations like aeroelastic tailoring of aircraft wings. The key idea is to use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and kernel PCA to map the numerous constraints onto a lower dimensional subspace where cheaper surrogate models can be constructed. This helps mitigate the curse of dimensionality and computational burden when having to model thousands of expensive black-box constraints. The method is applied to test problems, showing improved efficiency over standard approaches while still finding feasible optima. Promising results are also shown for an aeroelastic tailoring problem with over a thousand constraints. Overall, this work introduces a computationally cheaper way to perform constrained Bayesian optimization in high dimensions by exploiting redundancy in constraint space, opening the door for efficient global optimization of complex engineering systems.
