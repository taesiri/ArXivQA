# [TLCE: Transfer-Learning Based Classifier Ensembles for Few-Shot   Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04225)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TLCE, a transfer learning-based ensemble approach for few-shot class-incremental learning. The method combines a robust hyperdimensional (RHD) network that maps base class images to quasi-orthogonal prototypes to minimize interference, with a transferable knowledge network (TKN) pre-trained on base classes to acquire discriminative embeddings, especially for novel classes. During testing, prototypes are computed for novel classes and classification is performed by finding the nearest prototype using weighted integration of RHD and TKN's cosine similarity scores. Without additional training, TLCE leverages diverse knowledge in an ensemble to alleviate catastrophic forgetting of old classes and overfitting to new classes. Experiments on miniImageNet and CIFAR-100 in the 5-way 5-shot setting demonstrate TLCE's state-of-the-art performance. The design enables improved feature discrimination, especially for novel classes, while preserving base class separation.
