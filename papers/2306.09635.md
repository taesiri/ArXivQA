# [CLIPSonic: Text-to-Audio Synthesis with Unlabeled Videos and Pretrained   Language-Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09635)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can we learn to perform text-to-audio synthesis without using any paired text-audio data, by instead leveraging unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models?

The key hypothesis is that the naturally-occurring correspondence between audio and images in videos, combined with the cross-modal representations learned by pretrained language-vision models like CLIP, can allow learning the mapping from text to audio without needing any explicit text-audio pairs.

In summary, the paper aims to show that text-to-audio synthesis can be learned without text-audio supervision by using videos and pretrained multimodal models as a bridge between the textual and audio modalities. The main hypothesis is that the visual modality can provide a rich conditioning signal to learn the text-audio correspondence in a self-supervised manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for text-to-audio synthesis that does not require paired text-audio data for training. Specifically:

- They propose a model called CLIPSonic that learns to synthesize audio from videos and their captions using a conditional diffusion model. The model is trained on unlabeled videos by conditioning the audio generation on CLIP embeddings of video frames.

- At test time, they explore two approaches to enable text-to-audio synthesis: 1) directly using CLIP text embeddings as conditioning (CLIPSonic-ZS), and 2) generating CLIP image embeddings from text using a pretrained diffusion model (CLIPSonic-PD). 

- They show CLIPSonic-PD improves over CLIPSonic-ZS in bridging the modality gap between CLIP's text and image embeddings. CLIPSonic-PD also approaches the performance of models trained on paired text-audio data.

- Their experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for text-to-audio synthesis without requiring text-audio pairs. Subjective listening tests also show the model generates high quality and relevant audio from textual and visual queries.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel approach to learn text-to-audio synthesis from readily available unlabeled videos and pretrained vision-language models, without needing scarce paired text-audio data.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on text-to-audio synthesis:

- This paper proposes a novel approach to learn text-to-audio synthesis without requiring paired text-audio data. Most prior work relies on large datasets of aligned text-audio pairs. This work explores an alternative direction by leveraging unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models.

- The proposed method uses videos as a bridge between the text and audio modalities. It trains a model to generate audio conditioned on video frames, and then transfers to text conditioning using CLIP embeddings. Other papers have not explored this idea of using videos in this way.

- The paper introduces a model called CLIPSonic that is based on diffusion models, CLIP embeddings, and a pretrained diffusion prior. This model architecture is unique compared to prior text-to-audio synthesis systems.

- The paper provides both objective and subjective evaluations. It compares against text-to-audio baselines using paired data, as well as an image-to-audio baseline. The subjective listening tests offer useful insights.

- The idea of using a pretrained diffusion prior to bridge the modality gap in CLIP embeddings is adapted from prior work in image synthesis, but has not been explored for text-to-audio synthesis before.

- The proposed method does not require any text-audio data. Other recent papers rely on large datasets like CLAP or AudioSet. This could be advantageous in settings where text-audio data is scarce.

In summary, the key novelties are the idea of using videos as a bridge, the proposed CLIPSonic model architecture, and the ability to learn without paired text-audio data. The evaluations also provide useful comparisons to other state-of-the-art systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Scaling up the proposed method to a larger amount of videos. The authors mention that using a larger video dataset could help improve the performance and generalization of their method.

- Exploring the use of tri-modal audio-vision-language models. The authors suggest using models that are pretrained on audio, visual, and text data, such as Wu et al.'s Wav2CLIP or Rouditchenko et al.'s AVLnet. This could help better align the different modalities.

- Using the proposed method as a pretraining approach before finetuning on a dataset with text-audio pairs. The authors suggest their method could help provide a useful initialization for training language-audio models.

- Using more powerful language-vision models that can understand video sequences rather than just single frames. This could allow the method to handle more complex textual queries involving events and interactions over time.

- Overcoming the limitation of relying on the visual modality, which may not capture certain audio attributes like pitch and tempo. Alternative conditioning signals may need to be explored.

- Improving controllability for generating complex audio like speech and music. The current method has limited capabilities for this.

In summary, the main future directions are scaling up the video data, exploring multimodal models, using the method for pretraining, handling temporal information, improving audio-only conditioning, and increasing controllability over complex audio generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes CLIPSonic, a text-to-audio synthesis method that learns from unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models. CLIPSonic trains a conditional diffusion model to generate the audio track of a video given an encoded video frame using CLIP (contrastive language-image pretraining). At test time, CLIP text embeddings are fed to the diffusion model in a zero-shot transfer setting. However, a gap is observed between the image queries used during training and text queries used during inference. To bridge this gap, a pretrained diffusion prior model is used to generate CLIP image embeddings from text embeddings. Experiments on VGGSound and MUSIC datasets show CLIPSonic can effectively learn text-to-audio synthesis without text-audio pairs. A subjective listening test also demonstrates improved fidelity over a state-of-the-art image-to-audio model. The key idea is to leverage the naturally co-occurring audio-visual correspondence in videos and the cross-modal representation learning of CLIP to learn text-audio correspondence.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for text-to-audio synthesis that does not require paired text-audio data for training. The key idea is to leverage the naturally occurring audio-visual correspondence in unlabeled videos and use vision as a bridge modality between text and audio. The proposed model, called CLIPSonic, consists of three main components - a conditional diffusion model for audio synthesis, a CLIP model for cross-modal language-vision representation learning, and a diffusion prior model for bridging the modality gap between CLIP image and text embeddings. 

During training, CLIPSonic learns to generate the audio track of a video conditioned on a CLIP-encoded image from a video frame. At inference time, text queries are encoded to CLIP text embeddings and fed to the model. However, a gap is observed between CLIP image and text embeddings, so a pretrained diffusion prior model is used to map text embeddings to image embeddings and improve results. Experiments on the VGGSound and MUSIC datasets demonstrate the model's ability to perform text-to-audio synthesis without paired training data. A subjective listening test also shows it generates high quality and relevant audio compared to baselines. The work provides a new direction for text-to-audio synthesis using videos and pretrained multimodal models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a model called CLIPSonic for text-to-audio synthesis without using any paired text-audio data. CLIPSonic is based on a conditional diffusion model for audio generation. It is trained on unlabeled videos to synthesize the audio track from a video frame encoded by CLIP, a pretrained contrastive language-vision model. At inference time, CLIP is used to encode a text query, which is fed to the diffusion model to generate audio. However, a gap is observed between using image and text queries. To address this, a pretrained diffusion prior model is used to generate a CLIP image embedding from the text embedding before feeding to the diffusion model. This helps bridge the modality gap between CLIP's image and text embeddings. The overall approach leverages the naturally co-occurring audio-visual correspondence in videos and the multimodal knowledge in pretrained language-vision models to learn text-audio synthesis without needing any explicit text-audio training pairs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of text-to-audio synthesis without using paired text-audio data. The key questions it tries to answer are:

1. Can we learn to synthesize audio from text queries by leveraging unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models, without using any paired text-audio data?

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed CLIPSonic model relies on unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models like CLIP to learn text-to-audio synthesis. What are some limitations of relying solely on the visual domain as a bridge between text and audio? For example, could certain audio concepts like pitch, tempo, genre be difficult to learn through only the visual modality?

2. The authors use a pretrained diffusion model as a "prior" to help bridge the modality gap between CLIP image and text embeddings. What architectural modifications or training procedures could potentially improve the ability of this diffusion prior model to align the text and image modalities?

3. The proposed model uses a mel spectrogram representation for the audio during training. How might using a different audio representation like raw waveforms affect the model performance? What are some tradeoffs between these different representations?

4. The authors demonstrate the ability to perform zero-shot text-to-audio synthesis after training only on image-audio pairs from videos. What other potential zero-shot tasks could be enabled by training on unlabeled video data and transferring to novel modalities?

5. The model is conditioned on a single video frame, but videos contain rich temporal information. How could the model be extended to take advantage of multiple frames or the temporal dynamics in videos during training?

6. The model relies on a separate neural vocoder (BigVGAN) to invert the generated mel spectrograms into audio waveforms. How does the choice of vocoder impact the final synthesized audio quality and how could the vocoder be jointly trained or optimized along with the spectrogram model?

7. The authors use a simple prompt structure of "a photo of [class name]" during training and testing. How could more complex prompting schemes potentially improve the model's ability to generate diverse, high-fidelity audio conditioned on text?

8. The model is evaluated using both automatic metrics like FAD and human listening tests. What are the tradeoffs between automatic and human evaluation for generative audio models? How could the subjective listening tests be improved or expanded?

9. How does the performance of the proposed model compare to other recent text-to-audio synthesis methods that do use paired text-audio data? What are the tradeoffs between supervised and self-supervised approaches like this?

10. The model is trained on two datasets - one large and diverse (VGGSound) and one small and domain-specific (MUSIC). How do performance and training differences on these datasets demonstrate the generalizability versus specificity of the method?
