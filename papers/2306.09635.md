# [CLIPSonic: Text-to-Audio Synthesis with Unlabeled Videos and Pretrained   Language-Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09635)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can we learn to perform text-to-audio synthesis without using any paired text-audio data, by instead leveraging unlabeled videos and pretrained language-vision models?The key hypothesis is that the naturally-occurring correspondence between audio and images in videos, combined with the cross-modal representations learned by pretrained language-vision models like CLIP, can allow learning the mapping from text to audio without needing any explicit text-audio pairs.In summary, the paper aims to show that text-to-audio synthesis can be learned without text-audio supervision by using videos and pretrained multimodal models as a bridge between the textual and audio modalities. The main hypothesis is that the visual modality can provide a rich conditioning signal to learn the text-audio correspondence in a self-supervised manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for text-to-audio synthesis that does not require paired text-audio data for training. Specifically:- They propose a model called CLIPSonic that learns to synthesize audio from videos and their captions using a conditional diffusion model. The model is trained on unlabeled videos by conditioning the audio generation on CLIP embeddings of video frames.- At test time, they explore two approaches to enable text-to-audio synthesis: 1) directly using CLIP text embeddings as conditioning (CLIPSonic-ZS), and 2) generating CLIP image embeddings from text using a pretrained diffusion model (CLIPSonic-PD). - They show CLIPSonic-PD improves over CLIPSonic-ZS in bridging the modality gap between CLIP's text and image embeddings. CLIPSonic-PD also approaches the performance of models trained on paired text-audio data.- Their experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for text-to-audio synthesis without requiring text-audio pairs. Subjective listening tests also show the model generates high quality and relevant audio from textual and visual queries.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel approach to learn text-to-audio synthesis from readily available unlabeled videos and pretrained vision-language models, without needing scarce paired text-audio data.
