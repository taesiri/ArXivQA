# [Monitoring Sustainable Global Development Along Shared Socioeconomic   Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04416)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes approaches to monitor and quantify sustainable development trajectories relative to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The SSPs characterize potential global development pathways through 2100 along dimensions of sustainability, inequality, rivalry between regions, and fossil fuel dependence. The authors put forward methods to distill complex environmental and socioeconomic data into interpretable scores that quantify a region's alignment with different SSPs over time. Proposed techniques include mathematical measures using norms to calculate differences from SSP projections, TraCE scores that assess trajectory alignment, and time series classification with machine learning. An initial study applies these to recent country-level data, demonstrating the ability to monitor development pathways and compare across regions. The authors envision these quantitative SSP alignment assessments, which condense multiple features into a single metric, as an important tool to assist stakeholders in tracking progress and making decisions to address issues like climate change. They emphasize the need for collaboration with experts across domains and transparent reporting to ensure responsible application.
