# [Learning Social Fairness Preferences from Non-Expert Stakeholder   Opinions in Kidney Placement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modern kidney placement systems incorporate AI models to predict transplant outcomes. However, these models exhibit unfairness due to biases inherited from the training data. 
- Prior attempts to evaluate fairness rely on surgeon decisions instead of true long-term outcomes. This ignores biases of experts and other non-expert stakeholders.

Solution:
- The paper designs a novel crowdsourcing study on Prolific to evaluate an acceptance rate predictor (ARP) model from the perspective of non-expert public stakeholders. 
- It develops a logit-based feedback model to encode the ambiguity in people's preferences across multiple fairness notions using Likert scale responses.
- The paper proposes an efficient social fairness preference learning algorithm called SAFF based on minimizing feedback regret using stochastic gradient descent.

Key Contributions:
- First study evaluating an AI system in kidney placement from the perspective of non-expert public stakeholders.
- Novel logit-based feedback model capturing ambiguity in multi-dimensional fairness preferences.  
- Efficient learning of social preferences across six group fairness notions using projected gradient descent.
- Analysis of public preferences and fairness perceptions regarding the ARP model based on a real-world Prolific study.
- The tested ARP model is deemed reasonably fair by participants according to preferred notions of accuracy equality and predictive equality.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in evaluating AI fairness in sensitive domains like healthcare from the public's perspective. The proposed methods and analysis provide valuable insights into designing socially-aware and trustworthy AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper designs a survey to collect public opinions on the fairness of a kidney acceptance rate predictor, proposes a model to learn social preferences over different fairness notions from the survey responses, and analyzes the results to estimate public preferences and deem the predictor as reasonably fair.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1) It investigates the first-of-its-kind non-expert (i.e. public) perception of fairness of ML-based models used in kidney placement through a survey experiment on the Prolific platform. 

2) It proposes a novel logit-based feedback model to capture ambiguous fairness preferences across group fairness notions. 

3) It designs a projected gradient-descent algorithm called Social Aggregation of Fairness Feedback (SAFF) to minimize social feedback regret and learn public's social preferences recorded in the Prolific survey dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is collecting public opinions on fairness of an ML system for kidney placement, modeling the preferences using a novel feedback model, and learning the social preferences by minimizing feedback regret.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Kidney placement - The process of procuring kidneys and identifying potential recipients for transplant surgery.

- Machine learning fairness - Ensuring machine learning models used in kidney placement do not exhibit unfair bias or discrimination. 

- Group fairness notions - Mathematical definitions of fairness that seek parity of some statistical measure across groups defined by sensitive attributes like race, gender, etc.

- Public perception of fairness - Collecting non-expert opinions on the fairness of a kidney acceptance rate predictor through a survey experiment.

- Feedback model - A proposed logit-based model to represent ambiguous participant fairness preferences across multiple notions of fairness.  

- Social preference learning - An algorithm proposed to learn aggregated public preferences over different definitions of group fairness by minimizing feedback regret.

- Prolific survey - A survey experiment conducted with public participants on the Prolific platform to evaluate fairness perceptions.

The key focus is on modeling public perceptions of fairness for an ML system used in kidney placement and learning social preferences over different mathematical definitions of group fairness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel logit-based feedback model to encode the Likert scale choices from survey participants. Can you explain in detail the key components of this feedback model and the mathematical formulation? 

2. The goal is to learn the social preference weights across different fairness notions that minimize the average feedback regret. Explain what is feedback regret and how it is mathematically formulated in this paper.

3. The paper presents a Social Aggregation of Fairness Feedback (SAFF) algorithm to learn the social preference weights. Walk through the key steps of this algorithm and the gradient computations involved. 

4. The gradient of the social regret function is computed using a Social Regret Gradient (SRG) method. Can you elaborate the computations involved in formulating this gradient?

5. The proposed method assumes the true intrinsic fairness evaluation follows a logit-normal distribution. What is the rationale behind this assumption and how is it incorporated into the feedback model?

6. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. Explain the process of generating synthetic participant preferences and the evaluation protocol. 

7. Real-world survey data is collected from crowd workers to evaluate the method. Discuss the key elements in the design of this survey experiment.  

8. What are the limitations of relying on non-expert opinions to evaluate fairness versus using expert stakeholder opinions? How does the paper address this?

9. The paper concludes that accuracy equality and predictive equality are most preferred by public stakeholders. Analyze the results and discuss why this conclusion is reached.

10. How can the proposed methods be extended to other application domains beyond kidney placement? What are some challenges to be addressed?
