# [Removing Objects From Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11966)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to remove objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in a way that plausibly fills in the missing regions while preserving multi-view consistency. 

The key hypothesis is that pairing the multi-view consistency of NeRFs with the generative power of 2D inpainting models can enable realistic removal and inpainting of objects in rendered NeRF scenes.

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework to remove objects from NeRF reconstructions created from an RGB-D sequence, using 2D image inpainting guided by user-provided masks. The main challenges are handling inconsistencies between per-frame 2D inpaintings and achieving plausible 3D completions. The key ideas are:

1) Using a confidence-based view selection procedure to choose which inpainted frames to include when optimizing the NeRF, in order to avoid artefacts.

2) Leveraging recent advances in single image inpainting to fill in missing regions.

3) Enforcing multi-view consistency in the NeRF model architecture.

The main hypothesis is that this approach can effectively edit NeRF scenes by removing objects and plausibly inpainting the missing regions in a multi-view consistent manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a framework to remove objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in a plausible way. Specifically:

- They propose the first approach to inpaint NeRFs by leveraging single image inpainting methods. This allows them to fill in missing regions in a generative way.

- They introduce a novel view selection mechanism that automatically removes inconsistent views during NeRF optimization. This prevents artefacts from bad inpaintings. 

- They present a new dataset for evaluating object removal and inpainting in indoor and outdoor scenes.

In summary, the paper introduces a method to edit NeRFs by removing objects, while realistically filling the resulting holes in a multi-view consistent manner. The key ideas are to leverage recent advances in image inpainting and introduce a confidence-based view selection procedure to handle inconsistencies. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experiments on a new challenging dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to remove objects from neural radiance fields by leveraging 2D image inpainting techniques and automatically selecting consistent inpainted views during optimization to synthesize novel views where the object is plausibly removed.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on removing objects from neural radiance fields/novel view synthesis:

- This paper introduces a new method for removing objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs) by leveraging 2D image inpainting techniques. It is one of the first works focusing specifically on "editing" NeRFs by removing objects.

- Compared to prior work on video/image inpainting, this paper uniquely focuses on inpainting in a way that maintains multi-view consistency to enable novel view synthesis. Regular 2D inpainting methods don't have this capability.

- Compared to previous NeRF editing works like object-centric NeRFs, this method allows for more flexible removal and inpainting rather than just manipulating pretrained objects. The inpainting allows hallucinating previously unobserved content.

- They compare to recent generative models for novel view synthesis (PixelSynth, CompNVS) and show superior quantitative and qualitative performance for inpainting, while also not requiring a large dataset like those methods.

- Their iterative view selection method is novel compared to prior work and shows improved multi-view consistency over naive use of per-frame 2D inpaintings.

- They contribute a new dataset of indoor/outdoor scenes for evaluating object removal/inpainting in NeRFs. This pushes progress on an important problem.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions over prior work by being one of the first to tackle object removal in NeRFs, developing an effective approach combining ideas from NeRFs and 2D inpainting, and introducing a dataset to properly benchmark methods. The comparisons show advantages over existing techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the 2D inpainting method used, since the performance of their approach is upper bounded by the 2D inpainting. They suggest future improvements in single image inpainting can be directly translated to improvements in their NeRF inpainting method.

- Handling large masks covering a big portion of the scene across multiple views, where the 2D inpainting method fails on all frames. 

- Mitigating blurring caused by flickering textures in the 2D inpainted views.

- Better handling of shadows and reflections of removed objects, which currently remain in their renderings if not explicitly masked.

- Exploring alternative depth inpainting methods, instead of using the same network as RGB inpainting. A depth-specific inpainting could improve results.

- Relaxing the requirement for depth maps, for example by using depth estimation or multi-view stereo methods. They demonstrate this is possible but performance drops a bit without real depth data.

- Extending the method to video sequences, for temporally coherent novel view synthesis.

So in summary, they suggest directions to improve the 2D inpainting component, handle challenging cases like large masks, improve details like shadows/reflections, relax the requirements on depth input data, and extend the framework to video sequences. The core idea seems promising for future work on editing neural radiance fields.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for removing objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs) while realistically filling in the resulting holes. The approach uses 2D image inpainting methods to inpaint masks in each view independently. However, single view inpaintings often contain inconsistencies across views. To address this, the method introduces a confidence-based view selection scheme that iteratively removes low confidence (inconsistent) views from NeRF optimization. This helps prevent artifacts from bad inpaintings while still leveraging their generative power. Experiments on a new dataset introduced in the paper demonstrate the approach produces higher quality inpaintings compared to alternatives, with improved multi-view consistency. The framework enables editing NeRF scene representations by plausibly removing unwanted or private objects.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for removing objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs). NeRFs are an emerging scene representation that allow novel view synthesis, but currently lack good methods for editing out parts of the scene. The authors tackle the problem of plausibly removing objects from NeRF reconstructions of indoor and outdoor scenes. Their approach combines multi-view information from the input cameras with 2D image inpainting models. 

The key idea is to inpaint each input view using a 2D inpainting model, and then selectively choose a subset of consistent inpainted views to optimize the NeRF. This avoids artifacts caused by inconsistent inpaintings. Specifically, they introduce a confidence prediction for each view during NeRF training, and iteratively remove low confidence views from the optimization. Experiments demonstrate superior performance to other novel view synthesis baselines on metrics of inpainting quality and multi-view consistency. The method is validated on a new proposed dataset of real indoor/outdoor scenes with objects removed. Limitations include reliance on 2D inpainting quality, blurring, and inability to handle shadows/reflections. Overall, this work presents an effective framework for object removal in NeRFs by combining strengths of 2D inpainting and multi-view 3D NeRFs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method to remove objects from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in a multi-view consistent manner. The key ideas are:

- Leverage recent advances in single image inpainting by inpainting the object mask in each view. This gives plausible inpaintings for each view independently. 

- Train a NeRF using these inpainted views. However, single view inpaintings often contain inconsistencies between views. To address this, they propose a confidence-based view selection method. This iteratively removes low-confidence (inconsistent) views during NeRF optimization.

- The NeRF uses two color prediction heads, one view-independent to encourage consistency. The view-dependent head models residual view inconsistencies using predicted uncertainty weights.

- They validate the approach on a new dataset of indoor/outdoor scenes with an object masked out in some views. Comparisons to image/video inpainting methods and NeRF baselines show superior view synthesis results.

In summary, the key novelty is inpainting NeRFs in a multi-view consistent way by selectively using single image inpaintings during optimization guided by predicted uncertainty.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of removing unwanted objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in a plausible way while maintaining multi-view consistency. Specifically, it focuses on removing static objects from NeRF reconstructions of real-world scenes created from RGB-D sequences.

The key questions/challenges the paper is trying to address are:

- How to seamlessly remove parts of a NeRF scene representation while realistically filling in the resulting holes in a way that looks natural.

- How to leverage information from multiple views to fill in occluded areas only visible in some frames. 

- How to fill in areas never observed in any view in a realistic way.

- How to do this removal and hole filling while maintaining consistency across novel views synthesized from the NeRF model.

So in summary, the main problem is removing unwanted static objects from NeRF scene representations in a multi-view consistent and plausible way.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF): The paper focuses on removing objects from NeRF scene representations. NeRFs are a popular 3D scene representation that can synthesize novel views of a scene.

- Object removal: The main goal is to remove a specific object from the NeRF scene while realistically filling in the missing regions. This is referred to as "inpainting" the NeRF.

- RGB-D sequences: The NeRF models are trained on sequences of posed RGB-D images. The depth information helps constrain the geometry.

- 2D inpainting: Single image 2D inpainting methods are used to fill in masked regions per frame. These are then integrated into the NeRF training.

- View selection: A key contribution is a confidence-based view selection method to determine which inpainted frames to include in NeRF training. It avoids artefacts.

- Multi-view consistency: Ensuring the inpainting is consistent across viewpoints is a challenge addressed.

- 3D inpainting: While per-frame 2D inpainting is used, the end result is a full 3D NeRF scene representation with the object removed.

- Scene completion: Removing objects requires plausible completion of the scene, which relates to work on 3D scene completion.

- Object removal dataset: A new dataset is introduced to evaluate object removal from RGB-D scans.

The key focus is using single image inpainting to improve multi-view consistent object removal in NeRF scene representations.
