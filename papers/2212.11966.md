# [Removing Objects From Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11966)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to remove objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in a way that plausibly fills in the missing regions while preserving multi-view consistency. 

The key hypothesis is that pairing the multi-view consistency of NeRFs with the generative power of 2D inpainting models can enable realistic removal and inpainting of objects in rendered NeRF scenes.

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework to remove objects from NeRF reconstructions created from an RGB-D sequence, using 2D image inpainting guided by user-provided masks. The main challenges are handling inconsistencies between per-frame 2D inpaintings and achieving plausible 3D completions. The key ideas are:

1) Using a confidence-based view selection procedure to choose which inpainted frames to include when optimizing the NeRF, in order to avoid artefacts.

2) Leveraging recent advances in single image inpainting to fill in missing regions.

3) Enforcing multi-view consistency in the NeRF model architecture.

The main hypothesis is that this approach can effectively edit NeRF scenes by removing objects and plausibly inpainting the missing regions in a multi-view consistent manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a framework to remove objects from neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in a plausible way. Specifically:

- They propose the first approach to inpaint NeRFs by leveraging single image inpainting methods. This allows them to fill in missing regions in a generative way.

- They introduce a novel view selection mechanism that automatically removes inconsistent views during NeRF optimization. This prevents artefacts from bad inpaintings. 

- They present a new dataset for evaluating object removal and inpainting in indoor and outdoor scenes.

In summary, the paper introduces a method to edit NeRFs by removing objects, while realistically filling the resulting holes in a multi-view consistent manner. The key ideas are to leverage recent advances in image inpainting and introduce a confidence-based view selection procedure to handle inconsistencies. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experiments on a new challenging dataset.
