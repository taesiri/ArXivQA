# [Explainable Adversarial Learning Framework on Physical Layer Secret Keys   Combating Malicious Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Physical layer security (PLS) techniques like physical layer secret key generation (PL-SKG) using channel state information (CSI) can be compromised by malicious reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that act as man-in-the-middle (MITM) eavesdroppers. 
- Existing PL-SKGs directly using reciprocal CSI or two-way randomness signals can be cracked by such MITM-RIS Eves.
- MITM-RIS Eves are difficult to detect/countermeasure using standard authentication protocols.

Proposed Solution:
- An adversarial learning framework is proposed between Alice and Bob to generate common features resistant to MITM-RIS Eve.
- Alice and Bob have generator neural networks (NNs) to transform their two-way signals into common features. A discriminator NN for Eve is also designed.
- Loss functions aim to maximize correlation of Alice's and Bob's features while minimizing correlation with Eve's features.
- After training generator NNs, symbolic regression using Meijer G functions is done to identify important terms and design an explicit formula for common feature generation.

Main Contributions:
- Deduces a theoretical mutual information gap between legitimate users and MITM-RIS Eve showing existence of resistant common feature space.
- Designs a GAN framework for Alice and Bob to learn common feature generator NNs resistant to MITM-RIS Eve. Uses correlation in loss functions instead of MSE.
- Performs symbolic regression on trained NNs to design an explicit formula for common feature generator giving transparency.
- Evaluates proposed GAN-based and explicit formula-based techniques against an NN-based MITM-RIS Eve. Achieves high secret key agreement rates between Alice and Bob even if Eve knows feature generation process.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel adversarial learning based approach for PL-SKG to defend against MITM-RIS Eves. The use of explainable AI provides transparency into the common feature generation process. Evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.
