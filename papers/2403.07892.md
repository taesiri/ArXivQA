# [Change Point Detection with Copula Entropy based Two-Sample Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Change point detection aims to identify abrupt changes in time series data. It has many applications such as detecting changes in natural systems, financial markets, etc. Though there exist methods for change point detection, developing effective nonparametric multivariate methods remains a challenge. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a new nonparametric multivariate method for multiple change point detection using a two-sample test based on Copula Entropy (CE). CE can capture complex dependencies in multivariate data. The key ideas are:

1) For single change point detection, the CE-based two-sample test is conducted between the two segments separated at each point of the time series. The point with the maximum test statistic is returned as the change point. 

2) For multiple change points, single change point detection is recursively applied in a binary segmentation framework - by repeatedly splitting segments and testing for changes.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces an effective nonparametric multivariate method for change point detection using CE-based two-sample testing.

- Demonstrates the proposed technique on simulated univariate/multivariate time series with different types of distributional changes. Comparisons are made with other methods revealing competitive or better performance.

- Validates the approach on real-world Nile river flow data to successfully detect change point corresponding to the known decreasing trend change in 1898.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions regarding a novel CE-based multivariate change point detection technique with empirical evidence of effectiveness. The main strengths are its nonparametric nature and applicability for complex multivariate time series across diverse domains.
