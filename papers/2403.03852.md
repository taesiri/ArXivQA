# [Accelerating Convergence of Score-Based Diffusion Models, Provably](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models like DDPM and DDIM achieve great performance for generative modeling, but often suffer from slow sampling speed due to extensive score function evaluations needed during sampling.
- Despite much recent work on speeding up diffusion sampling in practice, theoretical understanding of acceleration techniques is still very limited. 

Proposed Solutions:
- This paper proposes a training-free, accelerated deterministic sampler that improves the convergence rate of DDIM from O(1/T) to O(1/T^2).  
- It also proposes a training-free, accelerated stochastic sampler that improves the convergence rate of DDPM from O(1/sqrt(T)) to O(1/T).

Key Ideas:
- The accelerated deterministic sampler incorporates a "momentum" term in the update rule, inspired by high-order ODE solvers like DPM-Solver-2.  
- The accelerated stochastic sampler includes an additional random perturbation step in each iteration to enable a higher-order expansion of the conditional density.

Theoretical Contributions:  
- Establishes non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for both proposed samplers, rigorously confirming their acceleration over vanilla DDIM/DDPM.
- Theory allows for l2-accurate score estimates and does not require log-concavity/smoothness assumptions on the target distribution.
- Provides insights into acceleration via connections with higher-order ODE/SDE approximations.

Key Outcomes:
- The paper delivers rigorous theoretical confirmation that training-free acceleration of diffusion sampling is possible, through algorithm design guided by approximations from numerical analysis.
- This lays the groundwork for further improving sampling efficiency of generative diffusion models.
