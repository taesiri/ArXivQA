# [Expressive Higher-Order Link Prediction through Hypergraph Symmetry   Breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11339)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Higher order link prediction is an important task in network analysis. It involves predicting missing hyperedges (subsets of nodes) in a hypergraph.
- Many existing methods use hypergraph neural networks that are bounded by the Generalized Weisfeiler Lehman-1 (GWL-1) algorithm. However, GWL-1 has limitations in distinguishing symmetric structures like regular hypergraphs.
- Improving expressivity of GWL-1 while being computationally efficient is an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper characterizes limitations of GWL-1, showing it cannot distinguish regular hypergraphs. 
- A symmetry breaking preprocessing algorithm is proposed. It efficiently identifies induced subhypergraphs with GWL-1 symmetries using connected components of same GWL-1 node values.
- The symmetric subhypergraphs are replaced with single covering hyperedges during training to break symmetries and improve GWL-1's expressiveness.

Main Contributions:
- Formal characterization of GWL-1's limitations in distinguishing symmetric structures
- Efficient O(size of input) preprocessing algorithm to identify GWL-1 symmetric substructures  
- Method to break symmetric substructures and provably improve expressiveness of GWL-1
- Extensive experiments showing performance gains over strong baselines on multiple hypergraph datasets

Key outcome: An efficient, explainable preprocessing technique to improve expressiveness of GWL-1 based methods for higher order link prediction, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results.
