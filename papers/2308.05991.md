# [Cyclic-Bootstrap Labeling for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05991)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main research question this paper addresses is how to improve the scoring assignment of the multiple instance detection network (MIDN) in weakly supervised object detection (WSOD). Specifically, the paper proposes a method to ameliorate the quality of pseudo-labeling in MIDN, which is a key challenge in WSOD.

The key points are:

- In WSOD, MIDN inevitably assigns high scores to some unexpected region proposals when generating pseudo labels, hampering subsequent refinement. 

- The paper proposes Cyclic-Bootstrap Labeling (CBL) to optimize MIDN with rank information from a reliable teacher network.

- A weighted ensemble teacher (WET) model is constructed to produce more accurate detections. 

- A class-specific ranking distillation (CRD) algorithm leverages WET to distill MIDN with rank supervision.

- This additional rank-based supervision allows MIDN to achieve better scoring assignment among neighboring proposals.

- The overall framework forms a cyclic bootstrap procedure, where subsequent modules finally enhance MIDN itself.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that providing rank-based distillation to MIDN from a reliable teacher can improve its scoring assignment and thus generate better pseudo labels, which is a key challenge in WSOD. The proposed CBL framework implements this idea.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a novel cyclic-bootstrap labeling (CBL) framework for weakly supervised object detection (WSOD). 

- It introduces a weighted ensemble teacher (WET) model that is gradually updated via a weighted exponential moving average (W-EMA) strategy to take advantage of multiple student candidates.

- It develops a class-specific ranking distillation (CRD) algorithm to leverage the WET model for distilling the MIDN module with rank information. This provides additional supervision to MIDN to assign higher scores to more accurate proposals among neighboring ones.

- It proposes a multi-seed R-CNN (MSR) algorithm to utilize the WET model for mining multiple positive seeds and generating better pseudo labels to train the R-CNN head. 

- The overall framework forms a cyclic-bootstrap procedure, where the subsequent modules of MIDN are eventually utilized to enhance MIDN itself. This allows MIDN to achieve improved scoring assignment.

- Extensive experiments show the proposed CBL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2007, VOC 2012, and COCO datasets for weakly supervised object detection.

In summary, the key innovation is using the subsequent refinement modules in WSOD to distill and supervise the initial MIDN module in a cyclic manner. This improves the scoring assignment of MIDN, resulting in better pseudo labels and overall performance. The weighted ensemble teacher and proposed distillation algorithms are key to enabling this cyclic bootstrap process.
