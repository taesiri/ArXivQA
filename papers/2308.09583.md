# [WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models   via Reinforced Evol-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:

Can applying Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) to evolve mathematical reasoning instructions and train process-supervised reward models enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models? 

Specifically, the paper introduces WizardMath, a model that aims to improve the math reasoning capabilities of the open-source Llama-2 model. The key method proposed is RLEIF, which has three main components:

1) Evol-Instruct for math: Generates more diverse and complex math reasoning instructions via upward and downward evolution.

2) Instruction reward model (IRM) and process-supervised reward model (PRM): Trained to judge the quality of evolved instructions and correctness of reasoning steps. 

3) Active Evol-Instruct and PPO: Evolves instructions over multiple turns and trains WizardMath via reinforcement learning using the IRMs and PRMs.

The central hypothesis is that by applying RLEIF to evolve math instructions and leverage process-based reinforcement learning, the resulting WizardMath model will demonstrate substantially improved mathematical reasoning abilities compared to existing open-source LLMs. The paper aims to test this hypothesis through experiments on math reasoning benchmarks GSM8k and MATH.

In summary, the key research question is whether the proposed RLEIF method can enhance mathematical reasoning for large language models like Llama-2. The paper introduces WizardMath as a model trained using RLEIF to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing WizardMath, a new mathematics model that enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities of the open-source large language model Llama-2. 

2. Proposing a new method called Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF), which combines Evol-Instruct and reinforcement learning to improve LLM reasoning performance. 

3. Demonstrating that WizardMath significantly outperforms other open-source LLMs like Llama-1, Llama-2, Falcon, MPT, etc. on mathematical reasoning benchmarks like GSM8k and MATH.

4. Showing that WizardMath also exceeds the performance of some major closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, Claude Instant, PaLM-2, etc. on the GSM8k benchmark.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing a new mathematics-focused LLM called WizardMath that can surpass the capabilities of existing open-source and some closed-source LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks through an innovation in its training methodology combining Evol-Instruct and reinforcement learning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to related work in the field:

The paper proposes a new method called Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) for improving the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key novel aspects are:

- Using Evol-Instruct to generate diverse math instructions and data for fine-tuning the LLM. This builds off prior work on Evol-Instruct by adapting it specifically for the math domain, with downward and upward evolution principles. 

- Combining Evol-Instruct data generation with reinforcement learning using both an instruction reward model (IRM) and a process-supervised reward model (PRM). The PRM provides step-by-step feedback, which has been shown to be more effective than just outcome-based rewards.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on GSM8k and MATH benchmarks using the RLEIF method to fine-tune Llama-2. The model outperforms all other open-source LLMs by a large margin and even exceeds some major closed-source models like ChatGPT and Claude.

This represents an advance over prior work on improving math reasoning for LLMs, which includes methods like chain-of-thought prompting, consistency/validation, and data augmentation. The combination of Evol-Instruct and process-based reinforcement learning seems particularly promising for multi-step quantitative reasoning.

Compared to related closed-source models, the results are competitive and demonstrate the potential to achieve similar performance with open methods. The comparisons on established benchmarks like GSM8k and MATH highlight the capabilities of this approach relative to the field.

In summary, the paper introduces innovations in instruction generation and reinforcement learning that push forward the state-of-the-art for empowering mathematical reasoning in LLMs. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed RLEIF method.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further enhancing the Reinforcement Evol-Instruct Learning (REIL) method or developing even better methods to continue improving the reasoning performance of their model. As the authors note, their model still lags behind state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-2, so advancing REIL or new methods could help close this gap.

- Addressing the broader societal and ethical implications of large language models like their WizardMath model. The authors acknowledge their model could potentially generate harmful, unethical, or misleading information at times, so research is needed to tackle these issues.

- Exploring the application of their REIL method to other domains beyond mathematical reasoning, such as common sense reasoning or logical reasoning tasks. The authors developed REIL specifically for math, but suggest it could be adapted to boost reasoning abilities in other areas.

- Developing improved techniques for generating the diverse math instructions and process-based feedback used to train their model. The quality of the evolved instructions and process supervision signals appears important to the success of their method.

- Further analysis of the evolved instructions and reward model predictions to better understand the strengths and limitations of their approach. More insight into what the model learns could inform future improvements.

- Releasing more implementation details, code, and data to promote reproducibility and allow others to build on their work. The authors indicate they plan to release these pending legal review.

So in summary, advancing the REIL method, broadening its applicability, generating better training data, gaining more analytical insight, and enabling reproducibility seem to be some of the key future work recommended.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF), which combines Evol-Instruct and reinforcement learning to improve the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). First, the method generates diverse math instruction data through math-specific Evol-Instruct, which evolves instructions in two directions - making them easier (downward evolution) or harder (upward evolution). Then two reward models are trained - an Instruction Reward Model (IRM) to judge instruction quality, and a Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM) to assess each step of the solution. Finally, the original math instructions are evolved over multiple turns to increase data size, and the pretrained Llama-2 model is fine-tuned using the evolved data and reward models via proximal policy optimization (PPO). The key innovations are the specialized Evol-Instruct for math, and the combination of this with reinforcement learning using both instruction-level and step-level rewards.
