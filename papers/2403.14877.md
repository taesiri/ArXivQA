# [TEeVTOL: Balancing Energy and Time Efficiency in eVTOL Aircraft Path   Planning Across City-Scale Wind Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft face challenges in balancing energy and time efficiency during flight path planning, especially when navigating unpredictable urban wind fields. Existing mathematical modeling methods are limited in adapting to dynamic environments. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel path planning technique for eVTOL aircraft leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize energy and time costs. The key aspects include:

- Customizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for eVTOL path planning by tailoring network architecture, activation functions, normalization/regularization layers, reward scaling, etc.  

- Designing composite reward function considering energy consumption, travel time, distance to destination. Additional dynamic reward shaping is used to encourage continual optimization.

- Adopting curriculum learning to divide training into stages based on flight distances to facilitate learning.

- Simulating high-fidelity city-scale wind fields using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and integrating with learning environment.

Main Contributions:

- A new reinforcement learning framework effectively balancing energy and time efficiency for eVTOL path planning in dynamic urban wind fields.

- Comprehensive experimentation comparing against Dijkstra's algorithm in multiple wind fields. The results demonstrate the proposed technique can approximate theoretical optimal values for both objectives.

- Analysis of optimized flight paths under different strategies prioritizing energy conservation, time reduction or balancing both. Flight examples showcase the adaptability and efficacy of the learned policies.

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions in enabling energy-aware flight planning for eVTOL aircraft. The learning-based technique offers an efficient, scalable and robust solution for navigating unpredictable environments while gracefully balancing critical efficiency metrics.
