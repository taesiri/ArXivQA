# [GloTSFormer: Global Video Text Spotting Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video Text Spotting (VTS) aims to detect, recognize and track texts in videos. Previous methods have limitations: 
(1) They conduct local associations between two frames, ignoring abundant temporal information that can help handle issues like motion blur.  
(2) They use IOU distance and complex post-processing borrowed from multi-object tracking (MOT) without considering morphological characteristics of text that are more stable over time.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose GloTSFormer, a Transformer-based model for global video text spotting. Main contributions:

1) Global tracking: Maintains a global embedding pool to store historical embeddings. Uses a Transformer encoder-decoder to conduct global associations between current frame texts and trajectories in the pool.

2) Wasserstein distance: Measures positional similarity between text instances using Wasserstein distance between fitted Gaussian distributions. Considers both location and shape information, handling fast motion and deformation better than IOU.

3) Extensive experiments on public datasets, outperforming previous SOTA by a large margin. On ICDAR2015, achieves 56.0 MOTA, 4.6 absolute higher than previous best. Runs at 20 FPS with global association taking only 3.6ms per frame.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel global video text spotting Transformer model with a global tracking mechanism and Wasserstein distance to effectively exploit temporal and morphological information in videos. Experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GloTSFormer, a global video text spotting transformer that utilizes temporal information and morphological characteristics to improve video text tracking through global associations and a Wasserstein distance-based method for positional measurement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as:

1. A Transformer-based global tracking method called GloTSFormer is proposed for video text spotting, which associates multiple frames simultaneously to utilize temporal information. 

2. A Wasserstein distance-based method is introduced to conduct positional associations between frames, which takes into account both location and morphology of text instances.

3. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets including ICDAR2015 video, ICDAR2013 video, and Minetto. The proposed GloTSFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a large margin. For example, on ICDAR2015 video dataset, it achieves 56.0 MOTA, with 4.6 absolute improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new Transformer-based tracking framework GloTSFormer for video text spotting, which models global associations across frames and utilizes a shape-aware similarity measurement. Experiments prove its effectiveness in improving performance.
