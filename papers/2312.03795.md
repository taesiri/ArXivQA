## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AnimatableDreamer: Text-Guided Non-rigid 3D Model Generation and Reconstruction with Canonical Score Distillation":

Problem:
- Generating and reconstructing diverse, animatable 3D models of non-rigid objects from monocular videos remains challenging. Prior works are often category-specific, rely on multi-view data, or fail to maintain morphology over poses. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose AnimatableDreamer, a framework that unifies text-guided generation and reconstruction of non-rigid 3D models from monocular video.
- Key idea is Canonical Score Distillation (CSD), which simplifies 4D generation to 3D by denoising multiple camera spaces while optimizing a shared canonical space. 
- CSD backpropagates gradients through differentiable warping, ensuring time-consistency and morphological plausibility.
- Framework has two stages:
   1) Extract articulations from video, using CSD as regularizer.
   2) Generate new model by modifying prompt, annealing reconstruction loss.
- Balances reconstruction and CSD losses for synergistic effects. Recon provides geometry guidance, CSD brings diversity.

Main Contributions:
- First implementation of text-guided non-rigid 4D generation using video-based articulations.
- Pioneering monocular non-rigid reconstruction method utilizing inductive priors from 2D diffusion models. 
- Canonical Score Distillation strategy to attain synergy between animatable generation and reconstruction.
- Superior performance on generating and reconstructing diverse non-rigid 3D models from monocular videos.
- Generated models can be manipulated by controlling transformations of extracted bones.

In summary, AnimatableDreamer advances non-rigid 3D model generation and reconstruction by unifying these tasks through a novel canonical space distillation approach. It exceeds prior state-of-the-art across both generation diversity and reconstruction accuracy.
