## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes both feature engineering and ensemble learning techniques. What are the key advantages of using both compared to using just one? How do they complement each other?

2. LightGBM is chosen as the base learner algorithm. What are some key properties of LightGBM that make it well-suited for this application? How does it compare to other tree-based algorithms like XGBoost? 

3. The paper manually divides the features into 4 subsets - what is the rationale behind this? What are some potential drawbacks of manual division compared to automated approaches?

4. For the location trajectory dataset, model performance is relatively poor. What are some reasons this might be the case? What additional steps could be taken to improve modeling of this dataset?

5. What are some ways the stacking ensemble method leads to better performance compared to simpler ensembles like voting or averaging? What allows it to reduce variance and bias?

6. Hyperparameter tuning is not explicitly discussed. What impact could hyperparameters have on model performance? How should hyperparameters be selected for an ensemble model?

7. The data is from a single operator's network. How might model performance and approach change if multi-operator or nationwide data is used? What additional challenges might arise?

8. Only regression models are evaluated. Could a classification approach for credit scoring also be viable? What modifications would need to be made?

9. The interpretability of the model is not analyzed. For a credit scoring application, interpretability is important. How could the model be made more interpretable?

10. The model is static, trained once. How should the model be managed and updated over time as new data arrives? What strategies can make sure model performance doesn't degrade?
