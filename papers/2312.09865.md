# [Automating reward function configuration for drug design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09865)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Designing good reward functions to guide generative molecular design (GMD) algorithms is critical but challenging in AI-driven drug discovery. 
- Manual selection of computational methods to approximate biological assays and aggregation into a single reward score is error-prone and relies on trial-and-error.
- Existing methods rely on biased human judgement when constructing preferences over molecules.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel automated approach to learn reward functions that relies solely on experimental assay data. 
- Construct partial rankings over molecules based on Pareto dominance in the multi-objective space defined by assay results. One molecule dominates another if it is at least as good for every objective and better for at least one.  
- Train a neural network to predict these rankings. The network has access to the same components a human would use to construct a reward function.
- Show that this approach eliminates issues with manual tuning and bias.

Key Contributions:
- First principled automated method for learning reward functions from experimental data through Pareto-based rankings.
- Evaluation on data from real drug discovery projects shows learned functions outperform human-defined functions in correlating with project goals.
- Evaluation on synthetic benchmarks shows method can guide a GMD algorithm to generate compounds scoring as highly as with the real reward functions.
- Serves as a strong baseline and step towards full automation of reward learning for generative molecular design.

In summary, the key innovation is the automated learning of reward functions from experimental data by constructing partial rankings through Pareto dominance. This is shown to outperform human-defined rewards on real world drug discovery problems.
