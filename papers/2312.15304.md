# [Evaluating the Capability of ChatGPT on Ancient Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15304)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores the capabilities of ChatGPT for processing and understanding ancient Chinese text. As ancient Chinese has important cultural and historical value but is complex to analyze due to grammatical intricacies, the authors evaluate ChatGPT's potential to aid in this domain. 

Specifically, the paper examines ChatGPT's performance on two tasks - translating ancient Chinese text into modern Chinese, and recognizing ancient personal names from the text. The dataset used is Shi Shuo Xin Yu, an ancient Chinese book rich in biographies. 

For translation, the authors test different context lengths - feeding ChatGPT 1, 3, 5 or 8 ancient sentences at a time. Translation quality is evaluated using BLEU and BERT Score metrics. Results show ChatGPT performs best with 3 context sentences, achieving 20.19 BLEU-2 score. However overall scores are still low, indicating ample room for improvement. Analysis of a sample translation highlights ChatGPT's difficulties in preserving key details.

For name recognition, ChatGPT is compared to Jieba using precision, recall and F1 metrics. On 300 test sentences, ChatGPT strongly outperforms Jieba, reaching 87.01% precision and 77.58% F1 Score. But some challenges remain in relying on context for understanding.

In conclusion, while ChatGPT shows promise on these two ancient Chinese tasks compared to baselines, the authors assert its proficiency remains limited. They suggest that with greater ancient Chinese data, specialized tuning, and knowledge infusion, ChatGPT could significantly advance ancient text analysis - enabling cultural preservation and progression.
