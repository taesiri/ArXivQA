# [Accelerating Interface Adaptation with User-Friendly Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of a robotic interface communicating information to a human user when there are no pre-established conventions on how the human should interpret the interface's signals. Different humans may interpret the same interface signal differently. The challenge is to have the robotic interface adapt its signals over time so they convey the intended information to the specific human user.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is that although humans may interpret the same signal differently, they still have common underlying patterns they expect interfaces to follow (called "priors"). The paper proposes an information-theoretic approach to learn an interface policy that maximizes the correlation between the human's actions and the information the robot intends to convey, while also conforming to intuitive priors that humans expect like proportionality and convexity of signals.

The interface policy and a model of the human policy are represented as neural networks. Additional networks predict human actions and decode them to recover the intended robot information. These networks are trained online over interactions with the human to optimize an objective function that trades off maximizing human-robot correlation and minimizing divergence from the priors. This results in interface signals that rapidly adapt to the human while remaining intuitive.

Contributions:
1) Formulates robotic interface adaptation as an optimization problem that incorporates human-friendly priors to accelerate convergence to interpretable signals.

2) Proposes intuitive priors like proportionality and convexity of signals that humans expect interfaces to follow.

3) Shows through simulations and a 15-person user study that interfaces trained with the proposed method outperform baselines in enabling humans to interpret the information the robot intends to convey. Users also subjectively prefer interfaces generated by the proposed approach.
