# [Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05369)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution for Semantic Segmentation":

Problem: 
- Dilated convolution is widely used to expand the receptive field in CNNs for tasks like semantic segmentation. However, increasing dilation leads to reduced ability to capture high-frequency details (lower effective bandwidth). This causes issues like gridding artifacts when the frequency content in features exceeds the sampling rate of dilated convolutions.

Proposed Solution - Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution (FADC):
- Adaptive Dilation Rate (AdaDR): Dynamically predicts a spatially-variant dilation rate for each pixel based on local frequency content, assigning higher rates in smooth low-frequency regions to expand receptive field and lower rates in high-frequency regions to preserve details.

- Adaptive Kernel (AdaKern): Decomposes conv kernels into low-freq and high-freq components and dynamically adjusts their ratio on a per-channel basis to enhance high-frequency capture and effective bandwidth.

- Frequency Selection (FreqSelect): Reweights frequency bands in features spatially to suppress less useful high freqs, encouraging higher dilation rates and larger receptive fields.

Main Contributions:  
- Provides a frequency-domain perspective on diletion rate selection as a tradeoff between receptive field and effective bandwidth.
- Introduces novel strategies AdaDR, AdaKern and FreqSelect to enhance individual phases of dilated convolution and address limitations like gridding artifacts.
- Achieves SOTA tradeoff between accuracy and speed for real-time segmentation on Cityscapes. Also shows consistent gains when combined with deformable convolution and attention.
- Performs detailed ablation studies validating ability of FADC to capture more high-freq details and also expand receptive field.
