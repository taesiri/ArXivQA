# [HiKER-SGG: Hierarchical Knowledge Enhanced Robust Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing scene graph generation (SGG) methods assume access to clean, undisturbed images. However, real-world images often contain corruptions like glare, smoke, rain drops, etc. that can significantly degrade the performance of SGG models. There is a need for SGG methods that are robust to such image corruptions.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel SGG method called HiKER-SGG that utilizes hierarchical knowledge graphs and hierarchical prediction to enable robust scene understanding from corrupted images. The key ideas are:

(1) A corrupted Visual Genome (VG-C) benchmark with 20 types of corruptions (e.g. blur, noise, glare) is introduced to evaluate SGG model robustness. 

(2) A hierarchical knowledge graph incorporating superclass nodes is constructed from external knowledge bases like ConceptNet.

(3) The model first generates an initial noisy scene graph from the corrupted image. It then performs message passing between the scene graph and knowledge graph to refine the predictions.

(4) A hierarchical prediction approach is used where the model first predicts superclass labels (e.g. animal) before predicting finer-grained subclass labels (e.g. cat). This simplifies the prediction task.

(5) An adaptive refinement method is used to predict more specific predicate relationships instead of generic ones.

Main Contributions:

(1) First work to tackle the problem of SGG on corrupted images, with a new VG-C benchmark.

(2) Proposed HiKER-SGG method that utilizes hierarchical knowledge and prediction to enable robust scene understanding from corrupted observations.

(3) Extensive experiments show HiKER-SGG outperforms state-of-the-art SGG methods on both clean and corrupted images, with exceptional zero-shot robustness.

The paper makes important strides towards enabling reliable SGG from real-world corrupted images through the use of structured domain knowledge and hierarchical reasoning.
