# [Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Multi-Reward Weighting for   Multi-Style Controllable Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Textual style is important for conveying information beyond just semantics. Humans often use multiple styles simultaneously when communicating. 
- Large language models (LLMs) should be able to understand and generate text with control over multiple styles, e.g. to produce non-toxic, humorous text. 
- Controlling for multiple styles is challenging as styles interact in complex ways and multi-style text data is scarce. Prior work has focused on single style control.

Proposed Solution:
- Use reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune an LLM to control multiple styles by combining rewards from multiple pre-trained style discriminators.
- Explore various formulations for multi-style rewards: logits, softmax, calibrated softmax, binary, and dynamic weighting based on discriminator gradients.  

Key Contributions:
- First comparison of formulations for multi-style reward in RL text generation. Dynamic weighting works best.
- Learned policies successfully control for 2-3 styles like sentiment, formality, toxicity, irony etc. even for rare combinations.
- Analysis of which style combinations are easiest/hardest to learn. Performance correlates with frequency in human text.
- Implemented custom PPLM pipeline with multiple discriminators for comparison. RL outperforms on control.
- Observed side effects: fine-tuning can alter factual understanding and lead to shifts in uncontrolled styles.

In summary, the paper pioneers a reinforcement learning approach with novel dynamic reward formulation to achieve controlled generation w.r.t multiple textual styles from an LLM.
