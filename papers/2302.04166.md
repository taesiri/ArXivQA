# GPTScore: Evaluate as You Desire

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses of this paper are:1) Can generative pre-trained language models like GPT-3 be used to effectively evaluate text quality along multiple dimensions with just natural language instructions? The hypothesis is that the emergent abilities of large language models like GPT-3 for in-context learning and following instructions can allow them to effectively evaluate text quality in a customized, multi-faceted way without needing annotated training data.2) How does the performance of GPT-3 based text evaluation compare to existing automated metrics and human evaluation?The hypothesis is that GPT-3 based evaluation will correlate better with human judgments compared to existing automated metrics across a diverse set of text generation tasks and quality aspects.3) How do different variants of GPT-3 (model size, with/without fine-tuning) compare in their ability to evaluate text quality? The hypothesis is that larger GPT-3 models will perform better at text evaluation compared to smaller models, and human feedback fine-tuning may further improve evaluation capabilities.4) Can providing example demonstrations further improve GPT-3's evaluation capabilities compared to just instructions?The hypothesis is that adding a few example demonstrations will allow GPT-3 models to better learn the evaluation criteria in-context and improve correlation with human judgments.In summary, the key research questions focus on exploring GPT-3 for customizable multi-faceted text evaluation, comparing it to existing methods, and analyzing the effects of model size, fine-tuning, and demonstrations. The overarching hypothesis is that GPT-3 can effectively evaluate text in a human-like way with just instructions and examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a novel evaluation framework called GPTScore that utilizes the capabilities of large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 for evaluating generated text. Specifically:- GPTScore leverages the zero-shot instruction and in-context learning abilities of models like GPT-3 to evaluate text on multiple customizable aspects just from natural language descriptions, without needing training data.- The framework is flexible to incorporate task specifications, aspect definitions, and example demonstrations to help define the evaluation protocol. - Experiments cover many common NLP generation tasks (dialogue, summarization, MT, etc.) and aspects, showing GPTScore achieves strong performance across a range of models and datasets.- Analysis provides insights into the benefits of instruction and demonstration, model size, and relationships between aspects.So in summary, the key contribution appears to be introducing and validating a new paradigm for customizable, multifaceted, and zero-shot text evaluation through the capabilities of large pre-trained language models. The variety of experiments and analysis help demonstrate the potential of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes GPTScore, a novel text evaluation framework that leverages the emergent abilities of large pre-trained language models like GPT-3 to score generated text through natural language instructions, enabling customized, multi-faceted, and training-free evaluation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The use of generative pre-trained models like GPT-3 for text evaluation is a novel approach. Most prior work has focused on designing supervised metrics or referenceless metrics based on pretrained embeddings/encoders like BERT. Using the generative capabilities of models like GPT-3 to directly evaluate text is an interesting new direction.- The idea of leveraging the few-shot learning abilities of large language models is promising for creating customizable evaluation metrics on the fly. Other recent work like UniEval and HolisticEval has also explored this direction of "programmable" metrics. However, this paper specifically utilizes the generative aspect of models like GPT-3 which is a different take.- Evaluating multiple quality aspects of generated text like relevance, coherence, diversity etc. has been explored before in metrics like BERTScore and HolisticEval. The novelty here lies in using instruction-based tuning to get faceted evaluations from a single generative model.- The scale of evaluation conducted in this paper across multiple text generation tasks and datasets is quite extensive. The experiments demonstrate these metrics can work across domains like summarization, dialogue, data-to-text etc. - For dialogue evaluation specifically, this approach provides an alternative to specialized trained metrics like FED. Leveraging GPT-3's in-context learning avoids the need for training data.- One limitation is the comparison is mostly to reference-based metrics that also require training. Comparing to/combining with referenceless metrics like BERTScore and HolisticEval could be informative.Overall, this is a thorough exploration of utilizing generative pretrained models for text evaluation in a programmable, multi-aspect and training-free manner. The scale of experiments across tasks is impressive. The results seem promising and this could become a flexible way to tailor text metrics.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring more advanced prompt engineering techniques to further improve the performance of generative text evaluators like GPTScore. The authors mention prompt engineering as an important direction for future work.- Studying the working mechanism of human feedback-based instruction learning (e.g. GPT-3's text-davinci-003 model), to understand when and why it fails compared to a model without human feedback like GPT-3's text-davinci-001. The authors found text-davinci-003 performed worse on many tasks despite being tuned on human feedback.- Evaluating cross-lingual texts by incorporating cross-lingual pre-trained models like mBART or Bloom. The authors mention this could help evaluate machine translation outputs better.- Expanding the framework to support more tasks beyond the 4 studied here, and more evaluation aspects beyond the 22 explored. The authors tested their method on a diverse set but there is room for even broader testing.- Conducting further analysis on the correlation and relationships between different evaluation aspects. The authors did some initial analysis but suggest more can be done there.- Testing different scoring functions beyond just likelihood, such as entailment and QA scoring. The authors relied on likelihood but other functions could be considered.- Exploring different prompt templates and prompt engineering methods for different tasks and aspects. The authors used some simple templates but more optimization could help.In summary, the main suggested directions are around improvements to prompts, aspects, models, and understanding model behaviors. The authors propose many promising ways to build on their presented framework.
