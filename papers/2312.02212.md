# [Portrait Diffusion: Training-free Face Stylization with   Chain-of-Painting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Face stylization refers to transforming a facial photo into a specific artistic portrait style. Current methods require fine-tuning pre-trained generative models on example portrait images, which is computationally expensive and struggles to achieve detailed style transfer.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Portrait Diffusion, a training-free framework for face stylization using off-the-shelf diffusion models. Key ideas:

1) Encode content and style images into latent codes via pre-trained diffusion model. 

2) During decoding, replace standard self-attention with proposed Style Attention Control to blend content and style features. This dual-branch architecture queries style features to guide stylization. Style Guidance scale controls intensity.

3) Address semantic confusion via Mask-Prompted Style Attention Control, using facial masks to restrict attention to valid regions.

4) Chain-of-Painting iteratively refines poor regions based on human feedback. Allows multi-style synthesis by changing references/masks.

Main Contributions:

1) Portrait Diffusion - Training-free portrait stylization using pre-trained diffusion models. Enables flexible fine-grained style transfer without model fine-tuning.

2) Style Attention Control - Blends content and style features in attention space for training-free stylization. Style Guidance scale controls intensity.  

3) Chain-of-Painting - New portrait stylization paradigm to iteratively refine images or synthesize multi-style portraits based on human feedback.

The key advantage is the ability to achieve detailed style transfer without computationally expensive model fine-tuning, while preserving content accuracy. Human evaluation shows Portrait Diffusion generates preferred stylized portraits over state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Portrait Diffusion, a training-free face stylization framework that can flexibly transfer fine-grained artistic styles to facial images through a Chain-of-Painting process which iteratively refines results by blending content and style features using a novel Style Attention Control method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. The paper proposes Portrait Diffusion, a novel training-free framework for face portrait stylization. This framework can flexibly transfer fine-grained portrait styles to a source image using an off-the-shelf diffusion model without any fine-tuning.

2. The paper proposes Style Attention Control to fuse content and style features in the space of self-attention and control the strength of style information via Style Guidance. This allows precise control over the stylization intensity.

3. The paper introduces Chain-of-Painting, a new portrait stylization paradigm which can progressively refine a stylized image or stylize a portrait with multiple style references. This facilitates generating higher-quality results and transferring multiple styles to different facial attributes.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed Portrait Diffusion framework and its components - Style Attention Control and Chain-of-Painting - which enable training-free, flexible and fine-grained portrait stylization and refinement. The method does not require fine-tuning a model on specific style examples.
