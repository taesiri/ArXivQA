# [Towards an Algebraic Framework For Approximating Functions Using Neural   Network Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01058)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks are commonly viewed as "black box" function approximators, but less work has explored them as mathematical objects with algebraic structure. 
- There is a need to develop a unified framework to treat neural networks as first-class mathematical objects analogous to real numbers.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce notation and terminology to describe neural networks, including parameters like width, depth, instantiation, composition.
- Define new neural networks like tunneling networks, power networks, polynomial networks, exponential networks, sine/cosine networks. 
- Show these networks exhibit properties akin to their real number counterparts, like exponentiation, polynomials, exponentials, etc.
- Derive bounds on accuracy, parameters and depth to characterize the neural networks.

Main Contributions:
- Formalized neural networks as mathematical objects with associated algebraic structure.
- Defined new neural networks that structurally resemble mathematical functions like polynomials, exponentials, trig functions. 
- Showed neural network variants of functions like $x^n$, $e^x$, $\cos(x)$ that achieve bounded approximation error.  
- Bounded the parameter growth and depth growth for these networks to be polynomial in the desired accuracy.
- Overall, developed a framework to approximate functions with neural networks while retaining interpretability.

The paper lays the groundwork for an interpretable, unified view of neural networks as algebraic objects analogous to real numbers. Key results bound the complexity of achieving a desired approximation accuracy. This is a novel perspective compared to black-box neural network modeling.
