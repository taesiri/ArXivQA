## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the integration of geometric constraints in deep learning based depth estimation frameworks. 

Problem:
Traditional depth estimation methods rely on explicitly modeling geometric constraints like photometric and multi-view consistency to estimate depth. With the rise of deep learning, most methods focus only on learning features and matching cost volumes, without explicitly modeling geometry. This works well when ground truth depth is available for supervision, but fails to enforce geometric reasoning in scenarios like unsupervised/self-supervised learning.

Solution:
This paper systematically reviews and taxonomizes techniques to integrate geometric constraints in deep depth estimation networks. The constraints enforce structural, occlusion and cross-view consistency.

The paper groups constraints into 8 categories:
1. Plane sweep algorithms create cost volumes using multi-view geometry.
2. Cross-view constraints like photometric consistency, geometric consistency using back-projection, flow-depth consistency etc enforce consistency across views. 
3. Geometry preserving constraints use structural similarity, edge-aware smoothness, 3D alignment etc.
4. Surface normal and depth consistency exploits their orthogonal relationship.
5. Attention mechanisms are made geometry-aware for matching cost aggregation.  
6. Geometric representations are learned using techniques like contrastive learning on image gradients.
7. High-level feature alignment uses auxiliary networks to guide depth network features. 
8. Other constraints use co-segmentation, data augmentation etc.  

Contributions:  
1. Comprehensive taxonomy and review of geometry constraints for integration with deep networks
2. Mathematical formulation and examples for each category of constraint  
3. Discussion of advantages and limitations of different constraints
4. Identification of open challenges and future directions

Overall, the paper serves as an extensive reference for enforcing geometric reasoning in end-to-end deep depth estimation frameworks through explicit constraints.
