# [EdgeConnect: Generative Image Inpainting with Adversarial Edge Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00212)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can image inpainting techniques be improved to better reconstruct fine details and generate perceptually realistic results in missing image regions? 

The key hypothesis is that incorporating edge information as an additional input to the image inpainting model will enable better reconstruction of fine details compared to existing inpainting methods. Specifically, the paper proposes a two-stage generative adversarial model called EdgeConnect that first predicts edges in the missing regions and then uses those edges along with color/texture information to fill in the missing regions. The hypothesis is that separating the tasks of edge generation and color/texture completion will allow the model to better reproduce fine details and generate sharper, more realistic inpainted results.

In summary, the main research question is how to improve image inpainting to generate more realistic and detailed results, with the core hypothesis being that using an explicit edge prediction stage will help achieve this goal. The experiments and results aim to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed EdgeConnect model with edge generation versus other inpainting techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new deep learning approach for image inpainting (filling in missing or corrupted parts of an image) that is better able to reproduce fine details in the filled regions. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- A two-stage adversarial model called EdgeConnect that first hallucinates edges for the missing regions, then uses those edges to guide the image completion network to fill in the missing regions.

- An edge generator that is able to hallucinate edges for irregularly shaped missing regions by taking the available edges, grayscale image, and mask as input.

- An image completion network that combines the hallucinated edges, color/texture information from the uncorrupted regions, and adversarial and perceptual losses to synthesize the missing regions.

- State-of-the-art performance on image inpainting benchmarks like CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView. The model generates sharper, more realistic results compared to prior methods.

- Analysis showing the importance of edge information for high-quality inpainting. The authors find a "sweet spot" for the amount of edge information that is most helpful.

The key insight is that generating the edges first makes it easier for the image completion network to fill in fine details and texture rather than having to generate everything from scratch. The edge information provides structural guidance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage deep learning model called EdgeConnect for image inpainting that first generates edges in the missing image regions and then uses those edges to guide an image completion network to fill in the missing regions in a visually consistent manner.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions to the field of image inpainting and generative image modeling:

- It proposes a two-stage approach of first hallucinating edges, then using those edges to guide image completion. This decouples the recovery of high-frequency (edges) and low-frequency (color, texture) information.

- The edge hallucination stage uses an adversarial model to generate perceptually realistic edges. This is different from many prior works that use predefined edge detectors like Canny. Learning the edges improves results.

- The image completion stage also uses an adversarial model along with perceptual and style losses. This produces sharper results with fewer artifacts compared to prior deep learning methods.

- The two-stage approach allows handling irregular masks and inpainting missing regions of arbitrary shapes. Many prior works were limited to rectangular regions.

- It demonstrates state-of-the-art quantitative results on CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView datasets compared to previous approaches like contextual attention and partial convolutions.

- It includes human evaluation experiments showing significant improvements in visual realism compared to other methods.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in inpainting by combining adversarial training, learned edge generation, and losses based on perceptual features and style. The two-stage set-up is flexible and produces improved results over single-stage deep generative models. The approach is well-evaluated and moves the field forward notably.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigate better edge detectors. The authors note that their edge generator sometimes fails to accurately depict edges in highly textured areas or when large portions of the image are missing. They suggest their model could be extended to high-resolution inpainting with an improved edge generating system.

- Apply the model to video inpainting. The authors propose their fully convolutional generative model could potentially be extended to video inpainting tasks. 

- Explore alternative loss functions and network architectures. The authors suggest exploring losses beyond the adversarial and perceptual losses used in their model. They also propose investigating different generator architectures.

- Applications in image editing. The generative inpainting model could be useful as an interactive image editing tool, for example to manipulate objects in the edge domain and generate new images. The authors demonstrate a simple example of object removal and image merging.

- Modeling longer range spatial dependencies. The authors note their model currently does not explicitly model longer range spatial dependencies in images. Incorporating such constraints could further improve results.

- Combining with semantic/content constraints. The model could potentially be improved by combining edges with high-level semantic or content constraints.

In summary, the main directions are developing better edge generation systems, extending the model to video and image editing applications, exploring architectural and loss variations, and incorporating higher-level semantic information. The core idea of using explicitly generated edges to guide image inpainting seems promising to pursue further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new deep learning approach for image inpainting that focuses on generating sharper and more realistic results compared to prior methods. The approach uses a two-stage adversarial model called EdgeConnect that first predicts edges in the missing regions using an edge generator, and then fills in the missing regions using those edges as guidance in an image completion network. Both stages use adversarial training and perceptual losses. Experiments on CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView datasets demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance compared to current state-of-the-art techniques. The model is able to reproduce finer details and fewer artifacts in the filled regions. The key insight is that explicitly predicting edges helps guide the image completion stage to generate sharper results with more realistic structures.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new deep learning method for image inpainting called EdgeConnect. Image inpainting involves filling in missing or corrupted parts of an image. The EdgeConnect method is a two-stage adversarial model that first generates edges for the missing regions, and then uses those edges along with the surrounding available image content to fill in the missing regions. 

The edge generator uses the available grayscale image, available edge map, and mask as input to hallucinate edges for the missing regions. The image completion network then takes the incomplete color image and a composite edge map (combines generated and real edges) as input to fill in the missing regions. Both stages use adversarial losses and perceptual losses. Experiments demonstrate the method outperforms prior approaches on CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively. The edge information provides critical structure that allows the image completion network to generate sharper, more realistic results compared to directly inpainting without edges.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a two-stage adversarial model called EdgeConnect for image inpainting. 

In the first stage, an edge generator hallucinates edges for the missing regions of the image based on the available edges and grayscale pixel intensities. It uses an adversarial loss and feature matching loss to ensure the generated edges are realistic.

In the second stage, an image completion network fills in the missing regions using the hallucinated edges as guidance. It combines the incomplete color image with the composite edge map (generated edges in missing regions + available edges) to predict RGB pixel values for missing areas. This stage uses an adversarial loss, L1 loss, perceptual loss and style loss to generate realistic inpainted results. 

The two stages are trained separately at first, then fine-tuned end-to-end. The edge information helps the model reproduce finer details and avoid blurring in the filled regions. Experiments on CelebA, Places2 and Paris StreetView datasets show the model outperforms previous methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

The main question the paper seeks to answer is: How can an image inpainting model be designed to better reconstruct high-frequency details and textures in the missing regions?

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel image inpainting model that incorporates edge information to improve inpainting quality. The model consists of two GANs - an edge GAN that generates edge maps from masked input images, and an image GAN that fills in missing regions based on generated edges and surrounding context. Experiments using CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView datasets demonstrate superior qualitative and quantitative performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like contextual attention and globally and locally consistent image completion. Ablation studies highlight the benefits of edge information, with optimal results obtained using a moderate level of edges from Canny edge detection. The model achieves higher PSNR, SSIM, and lower FID scores across varying mask sizes. Human evaluation via visual Turing tests further validate the realism of completed images. Overall, the paper presents a novel framework that leverages learned edge information to guide the image completion task, setting a new state-of-the-art for image inpainting.
