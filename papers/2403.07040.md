# [All in One: Multi-Task Prompting for Graph Neural Networks (Extended   Abstract)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07040)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) show promise for transfer learning, but aligning them with diverse downstream tasks remains challenging. This misalignment can lead to negative transfer and poor performance.

- Prompt learning has shown success in natural language processing (NLP) for efficiently adapting pre-trained models, but prompting strategies have not been well explored for graph tasks. Applying NLP prompt concepts to graphs introduces difficulties in areas like defining prompt content and formats.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a multi-task prompting framework to align pre-trained GNNs more closely with varied downstream tasks without altering model architectures. 

- It introduces a unified prompt format for language and graphs with prompt tokens, token structures, and insertion patterns to make prompts adaptable to graph structures.

- The framework reformulates node and edge-level tasks into graph-level tasks using techniques like induced graphs to generalize pre-training knowledge. 

- It employs meta-learning to optimize prompts across multiple tasks. Prompt parameters are updated based on performance over various tasks to make the final prompts effective for diverse graph applications.

Main Contributions:
- Novel graph prompt design with multiple learnable tokens and structures for more nuanced graph manipulation compared to prior single token methods

- Task reformulation strategy to convert node/edge tasks to graph-level, improving alignment with graph-level pre-training approaches  

- Meta-learning prompt optimization method to boost adaptability across multiple graph tasks

- Extensive experiments demonstrating superiority over supervised learning, fine-tuning, and prior prompting techniques across node, edge, and graph-level prediction scenarios

The approach enhances pre-trained model transferability across tasks and domains while being efficient for few-shot learning contexts where limited labeled data is available.
