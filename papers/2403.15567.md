# [Do not trust what you trust: Miscalibration in Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15567)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods rely on pseudo-labeling to leverage unlabeled data, where highly confident predictions serve as pseudo-labels to guide training. However, little attention has been paid to studying and improving the calibration of SSL methods. 

- The paper empirically shows that popular SSL methods based on pseudo-labeling are significantly miscalibrated. Through analysis, the paper formally shows that the cause is the minimization of a min-entropy term on a large proportion of unlabeled samples, which forces the model to make overconfident predictions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Based on the analysis, the paper proposes to use a simple penalty term that enforces a controllable margin on the logit distances of predictions for the dominant set of unlabeled samples. 

- This prevents logits from becoming too large, alleviating the issue of overconfident predictions caused by minimizing min-entropy.

Main Contributions:
1) Empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art SSL methods based on pseudo-labels are poorly calibrated.

2) Formally demonstrates the minimization of min-entropy, a lower bound of Shannon entropy, as a potential cause of miscalibration.

3) Proposes a simple penalty term to enforce a margin on logit distances to prevent overconfident predictions, consistently improving calibration of SSL methods.

4) Comprehensive experiments show the proposed solution systematically improves uncertainty estimates of relevant SSL models on image classification benchmarks, while also enhancing discrimination power.

In summary, the paper identifies and tackles an important yet overlooked issue of miscalibration in pseudo-labeling based SSL approaches through formal analysis, and provides an effective solution that is model-agnostic and brings consistent improvements.
