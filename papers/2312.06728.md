# [A Multimodal Dataset and Benchmark for Radio Galaxy and Infrared Host   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06728)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- With next-gen radio telescopes coming online, hundreds of millions of galaxies will be detected, needing efficient automated methods to analyze them. 
- Extended radio galaxies have complex structures with multiple associated components that need to be accurately grouped.
- No public dataset exists with radio, infrared and annotation data to develop ML methods for this task.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces a multimodal dataset with 2,800 images having radio, infrared and 4,155 annotation instances.
- Includes radio galaxy categories, bounding boxes, segmentation masks and infrared host positions.
- Benchmarked object detection algorithms and proposed a novel method to simultaneously detect radio galaxies and infrared host positions.

Main Contributions:  
- First public dataset with sensitive radio, corresponding infrared images and instance annotations by astronomy experts.
- Statistics on train/val/test splits, galaxy categories and annotation areas.
- Detailed comparison to other radio galaxy datasets showing the advances.
- Novel multimodal bounding box and keypoint detection approach for radio and infrared data.
- Results demonstrating simultaneous detection capabilities on the new dataset.

In summary, the paper introduced the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset to develop ML techniques for efficiently analyzing complex radio galaxies in next-gen radio surveys. A new method is also proposed and benchmarked for joint radio galaxy and infrared host detection.
