# [ORES: Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13785)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can open-vocabulary responsible visual synthesis be achieved, allowing administrators to genuinely prohibit the generation of arbitrary visual concepts?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new task called Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES), where the synthesis model can avoid generating any forbidden visual concepts specified by the administrator, while still allowing users to freely input desired content. 

- Existing methods have limitations in handling responsible synthesis for arbitrary concepts in an open-vocabulary setting. 

- The paper presents a Two-stage Intervention (TIN) framework to tackle this problem, by using a large language model to rewrite the query to avoid risky concepts, and intervening during image synthesis to guide the process.

- Experiments demonstrate that the proposed TIN framework is effective at reducing inappropriate image generation while preserving similarity to the original user's query.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed framework of rewriting queries with language models and intervening during synthesis can achieve open-vocabulary responsible image generation, avoiding arbitrary specified visual concepts. The experiments then provide support for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in responsible visual synthesis:

- Novel task formulation: This paper proposes the new Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (\raisebox{-0.2\height}{\includegraphics[height=1.2em]{ores_logo.png}} ORES) task, which aims to allow avoidance of arbitrary unspecified visual concepts while still accommodating diverse user inputs. This formalizes a missing scenario in the field.

- Combining LLMs and diffusion models: Prior work either refines inputs/outputs or fine-tunes models. This paper uniquely combines large language models (LLMs) with diffusion synthesis models for responsible synthesis. It shows the potential of LLMs for this task.

- Learnable instructions for LLMs: Most prior work designs manual prompts to guide LLMs. This paper presents a learnable instruction approach to automate prompt design for LLMs, reducing human effort.

- Prompt intervention for consistency: The proposed prompt intervention during synthesis maintains visual consistency with user inputs, while prior work often sees degraded similarity when removing concepts.

- Benchmark and evaluation: The paper provides an evaluation benchmark with a public dataset, metrics, and baseline models to standardize assessment of open-vocabulary responsible synthesis.

Overall, the key novelties are introducing the ORES task, using LLMs for responsible synthesis via learnable instructions, and maintaining visual consistency with prompt intervention. The benchmark and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to existing approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions in the paper:

- Extending the TIN framework to open-source LLMs instead of relying on OpenAI's API. The closed-source nature of ChatGPT currently increases response time and cost. Exploring integration with open-source models like Anthropic's Claude could help alleviate this issue.

- Evaluating the framework on additional datasets and tasks beyond image generation. The paper demonstrates applications to image editing, inpainting and video generation, but further benchmarking on diverse tasks would be valuable.

- Exploring different learning paradigms and architectures for the learnable instruction component. The current approach uses ChatGPT for instruction initialization and updating, but other meta-learning or reinforcement learning methods could be studied. 

- Enhancing the generalization of prohibited concepts by using more diversified training data. The concepts currently rely on a small manually created dataset, so expanding this could improve open-vocabulary capabilities.

- Studying integration of the framework into full generative pipelines. The paper focuses on diffusion models, but applying the approach to GANs or autoregressive models could provide a complete responsible synthesis solution.

- Investigating potential negative societal impacts and limitations around responsible AI systems. As the technology improves, continuously re-evaluating its broader implications will be important.

In summary, the main future directions are expanding the approach to more models and tasks, improving the instruction learning process, increasing generalization with more training data, integration into full pipelines, and continuous responsible AI research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new task called Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES), where the goal is to generate images that avoid displaying certain forbidden visual concepts specified by an administrator, while still accommodating diverse user inputs. To address this, they present a Two-stage Intervention (TIN) framework that involves 1) rewriting the user's query into a de-risked version using a large language model with learnable guidance, and 2) synthesizing images using the rewritten query to intervene at intermediate steps of a diffusion model. They created a dataset, baseline models, and benchmark for evaluating ORES performance. Experiments demonstrate their method can effectively reduce inappropriate image generation while preserving similarity to the original user's query. The work shows the potential for large language models to enable responsible AI in visual synthesis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES), where the goal is to generate images that avoid displaying specified visual concepts while still adhering to a user's query as closely as possible. This is important for responsible AI to prevent generating harmful content. The key challenges are that the concepts to avoid can be diverse and arbitrarily defined, and the user queries can implicitly contain the forbidden concepts. 

To address this, the authors propose a Two-stage Intervention (TIN) framework. First, a large language model rewrites the user's query into a de-risked version that removes the forbidden concepts. Second, a diffusion model synthesizes using the original query for initial steps and switches to the de-risked query later, balancing adhering to the user and avoiding concepts. Experiments on a new benchmark dataset demonstrate that TIN significantly outperforms baseline methods in evading concepts while maintaining visual similarity. By showing the potential of language models for responsible synthesis, this work opens up future research directions. The code and data are publicly available.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a Two-stage Intervention (TIN) framework to address the task of Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES). TIN has two key stages: 1) Rewriting with learnable instruction: A large language model (LLM) is used to rewrite the original user query into a de-risked query that avoids specified forbidden concepts, guided by a learnable instruction prompt initialized and updated by the LLM itself. 2) Synthesizing with prompt intervention: The original user query is first used to synthesize the initial steps, then intervention occurs by switching to the de-risked query for the remaining steps. This allows avoiding risky concepts while maintaining similarity to the original user intent. By combining an LLM for guided rewriting and prompt intervention during synthesis, TIN can effectively generate images that avoid arbitrarily specified visual concepts while adhering to the user's query.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is how to enable responsible and open-vocabulary visual synthesis, where the model can avoid generating specified visual concepts while still allowing users to provide any desired input queries. 

The key questions appear to be:

- How can arbitrary, unspecified visual concepts be avoided during image synthesis in an open-vocabulary setting? Existing methods have limitations in handling diverse and open-ended concepts.

- How can images be generated that follow user inputs as closely as possible while still avoiding specified visual concepts? There is a trade-off between being responsible and adhering to user queries.

- Can large language models assist in enabling open-vocabulary responsible visual synthesis? LLMs have shown promise in few-shot reasoning but their potential for this application is unclear.

The paper introduces a new task called Open-Vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES) to formalize this problem. It then proposes a Two-Stage Intervention (TIN) framework to address the challenges, utilizing both a large language model and diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate TIN's effectiveness for ORES compared to baselines.

In summary, the key focus seems to be on exploring how open-vocabulary responsible image synthesis can be achieved through interventions on language and visual models. The paper highlights the capabilities of LLMs for this task.
