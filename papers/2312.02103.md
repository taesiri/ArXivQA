# [Learning Pseudo-Labeler beyond Noun Concepts for Open-Vocabulary Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02103)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel pseudo-labeling method called Pseudo-Labeling for Arbitrary Concepts (PLAC) for open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD). PLAC aims to transfer the knowledge of vision-language models like CLIP to detectors for detecting arbitrary visual concepts beyond just noun categories. It trains a module called PLAC to translate CLIP image embeddings to corresponding CLIP text embeddings, which are then used as pseudo-labels for detector training. Compared to prior pseudo-labeling methods relying on noun phrase parsing, PLAC can generate labels capturing more complex semantics. A two-stage matching strategy is also introduced to effectively leverage both ground truth and pseudo-labels during training. Experiments on LVIS show PLAC boosts performance over the baseline by 5 AP, achieving 24.3 AP which is on par with state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, on the referring expression comprehension benchmark RefCOCOg requiring understanding beyond nouns, PLAC significantly outperforms previous methods, demonstrating its capabilities in detecting arbitrary concepts. Overall, PLAC provides an effective way to transfer knowledge of vision-language models to detectors to better recognize diverse real-world concepts.
