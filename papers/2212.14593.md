# [NIRVANA: Neural Implicit Representations of Videos with Adaptive   Networks and Autoregressive Patch-wise Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14593)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an implicit neural representation (INR) method for video compression that is more efficient, flexible, and scalable than prior approaches? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) An autoregressive, patch-wise prediction model will be more efficient by exploiting spatio-temporal redundancies in videos, compared to pixel-wise or frame-wise prediction models. 2) Modeling videos as groups of frames with separate networks, initialized from previous groups, will allow the method to scale to longer videos without degradation.3) Performing quantization during training will enable adaptive compression rates tailored to each video's complexity, avoiding slow post-hoc steps.4) The proposed method, NIRVANA, will achieve improved encoding speeds, decoding speeds, scalability, and adaptive compression while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance compared to prior video INR methods like SIREN and NeRV.In summary, the central goal is developing a flexible and efficient video INR framework through technical contributions like autoregressive modeling, patch predictions, and integrated quantization. The key hypothesis is that this approach will outperform prior video INRs in various aspects like speed and adaptability while achieving good compression rates and visual quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing NIRVANA, a neural implicit representation method for video compression. The key ideas are:- Using patch-wise prediction instead of pixel-wise or full frame prediction. This allows exploiting spatial redundancy while being flexible to different resolutions. - Using an autoregressive training approach where separate networks are fit to groups of frames (clips) in a video, with each network initialized from the previous one. This exploits temporal redundancy and allows scaling to arbitrary video lengths.- Quantizing the network weights during training itself using an entropy loss, avoiding need for post-hoc pruning/quantization. This adapts the compression rate to the complexity of each video.- The method achieves 12x faster encoding than prior work NeRV with comparable quality and bitrate on benchmark datasets. It also scales better to higher resolutions and longer videos.In summary, the key novelty is the autoregressive patch-wise modeling approach combined with in-training quantization, which allows spatially/temporally flexible and efficient video compression using implicit neural representations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new neural network-based approach called NIRVANA for efficiently compressing videos by modeling them with separate networks for groups of frames in an autoregressive and patch-wise manner to exploit spatio-temporal redundancy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in video compression using implicit neural representations (INRs):- The paper proposes an autoregressive patch-based modeling approach to INRs for videos rather than pixel-wise or full frame prediction. This allows better exploitation of spatial and temporal redundancy in videos compared to prior works. - Many existing video INR methods like SIREN and NeRV struggle with scaling to higher resolutions or longer videos. This paper shows the proposed method adapts well to 4K videos and longer sequences without performance degradation or needing architectural changes.- The proposed method achieves an order of magnitude speedup in encoding time compared to NeRV, a leading video INR technique, while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance. This makes the method much more practical.- The paper demonstrates adaptive compression based on inter-frame differences, compressing more static videos at lower bitrates. This is an advantage over NeRV which has a fixed compression rate.- The autoregressive and patch-based design enables easy parallelization across GPUs for faster encoding. The paper shows close to linear scaling on benchmark datasets.- The method performs model compression like weight quantization during training itself unlike post-hoc approaches in some prior works like NeRV. This avoids extra tuning steps.- While a concurrent work PS-NerV also proposes patch-based prediction, this paper shows significantly more speedup due to the added autoregressive training.Overall, the proposed technique seems to advance the state-of-the-art in video INRs by improving adaptability, encoding speed, scalability and parallelizability while achieving competitive rate-distortion performance. The results are demonstrated on standard benchmarks like UVG and long YouTube videos.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Further optimizations to the encoding and decoding speeds of their method. They show promising results with GPU parallelization, but further speed improvements could make the method more practical.- Exploring variable rate encoding by adapting the patch size, number of groups, entropy regularization, etc. based on video content. They show some promising adaptive compression results, but more exploration could allow better optimization of the rate-distortion tradeoff. - Extending the method to other modalities beyond RGB videos, such as depth, flow, etc. The patch-based autoregressive framework seems flexible enough to potentially encode other data types.- Combining their approach with predictive coding methods like differential coding used in traditional video codecs. The residuals between frame groups could potentially be further compressed.- Exploring the use of different network architectures beyond MLPs, such as Transformers, for representing the groups of frames. This could provide benefits in terms of computation and memory efficiency.- Applying the approach to related domains such as video super-resolution, enhancement, editing etc by exploiting the continuous representation.In summary, the main future directions are improving speed and compression efficiency, extending the framework to other data modalities and tasks, and exploring architectural improvements and hybrid coding schemes. The autoregressive patch-based framework shows a lot of promise.
