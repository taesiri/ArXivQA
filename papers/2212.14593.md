# [NIRVANA: Neural Implicit Representations of Videos with Adaptive   Networks and Autoregressive Patch-wise Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14593)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an implicit neural representation (INR) method for video compression that is more efficient, flexible, and scalable than prior approaches? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) An autoregressive, patch-wise prediction model will be more efficient by exploiting spatio-temporal redundancies in videos, compared to pixel-wise or frame-wise prediction models. 

2) Modeling videos as groups of frames with separate networks, initialized from previous groups, will allow the method to scale to longer videos without degradation.

3) Performing quantization during training will enable adaptive compression rates tailored to each video's complexity, avoiding slow post-hoc steps.

4) The proposed method, NIRVANA, will achieve improved encoding speeds, decoding speeds, scalability, and adaptive compression while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance compared to prior video INR methods like SIREN and NeRV.

In summary, the central goal is developing a flexible and efficient video INR framework through technical contributions like autoregressive modeling, patch predictions, and integrated quantization. The key hypothesis is that this approach will outperform prior video INRs in various aspects like speed and adaptability while achieving good compression rates and visual quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing NIRVANA, a neural implicit representation method for video compression. The key ideas are:

- Using patch-wise prediction instead of pixel-wise or full frame prediction. This allows exploiting spatial redundancy while being flexible to different resolutions. 

- Using an autoregressive training approach where separate networks are fit to groups of frames (clips) in a video, with each network initialized from the previous one. This exploits temporal redundancy and allows scaling to arbitrary video lengths.

- Quantizing the network weights during training itself using an entropy loss, avoiding need for post-hoc pruning/quantization. This adapts the compression rate to the complexity of each video.

- The method achieves 12x faster encoding than prior work NeRV with comparable quality and bitrate on benchmark datasets. It also scales better to higher resolutions and longer videos.

In summary, the key novelty is the autoregressive patch-wise modeling approach combined with in-training quantization, which allows spatially/temporally flexible and efficient video compression using implicit neural representations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new neural network-based approach called NIRVANA for efficiently compressing videos by modeling them with separate networks for groups of frames in an autoregressive and patch-wise manner to exploit spatio-temporal redundancy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in video compression using implicit neural representations (INRs):

- The paper proposes an autoregressive patch-based modeling approach to INRs for videos rather than pixel-wise or full frame prediction. This allows better exploitation of spatial and temporal redundancy in videos compared to prior works. 

- Many existing video INR methods like SIREN and NeRV struggle with scaling to higher resolutions or longer videos. This paper shows the proposed method adapts well to 4K videos and longer sequences without performance degradation or needing architectural changes.

- The proposed method achieves an order of magnitude speedup in encoding time compared to NeRV, a leading video INR technique, while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance. This makes the method much more practical.

- The paper demonstrates adaptive compression based on inter-frame differences, compressing more static videos at lower bitrates. This is an advantage over NeRV which has a fixed compression rate.

- The autoregressive and patch-based design enables easy parallelization across GPUs for faster encoding. The paper shows close to linear scaling on benchmark datasets.

- The method performs model compression like weight quantization during training itself unlike post-hoc approaches in some prior works like NeRV. This avoids extra tuning steps.

- While a concurrent work PS-NerV also proposes patch-based prediction, this paper shows significantly more speedup due to the added autoregressive training.

Overall, the proposed technique seems to advance the state-of-the-art in video INRs by improving adaptability, encoding speed, scalability and parallelizability while achieving competitive rate-distortion performance. The results are demonstrated on standard benchmarks like UVG and long YouTube videos.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Further optimizations to the encoding and decoding speeds of their method. They show promising results with GPU parallelization, but further speed improvements could make the method more practical.

- Exploring variable rate encoding by adapting the patch size, number of groups, entropy regularization, etc. based on video content. They show some promising adaptive compression results, but more exploration could allow better optimization of the rate-distortion tradeoff. 

- Extending the method to other modalities beyond RGB videos, such as depth, flow, etc. The patch-based autoregressive framework seems flexible enough to potentially encode other data types.

- Combining their approach with predictive coding methods like differential coding used in traditional video codecs. The residuals between frame groups could potentially be further compressed.

- Exploring the use of different network architectures beyond MLPs, such as Transformers, for representing the groups of frames. This could provide benefits in terms of computation and memory efficiency.

- Applying the approach to related domains such as video super-resolution, enhancement, editing etc by exploiting the continuous representation.

In summary, the main future directions are improving speed and compression efficiency, extending the framework to other data modalities and tasks, and exploring architectural improvements and hybrid coding schemes. The autoregressive patch-based framework shows a lot of promise.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NIRVANA, a new method for video compression using implicit neural representations (INRs). Unlike prior INR methods that predict individual pixels (inefficient) or whole frames (doesn't adapt to resolutions), NIRVANA predicts patches within groups of frames. This exploits spatial and temporal redundancy in videos. NIRVANA trains small networks on frame groups in an autoregressive manner, initializing each network with weights from the previous group's network. This allows it to scale to arbitrary resolutions and lengths. NIRVANA performs quantization during training to compress the networks, avoiding post-hoc steps. Experiments on the UVG dataset show NIRVANA achieves 12x faster encoding than NeRV with similar quality and compression rate. It also scales better to higher resolutions and longer videos. Ablations analyze the effects of different components. Overall, NIRVANA provides an efficient, flexible framework for video compression using INRs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NIRVANA, a new method for neural implicit video compression. Unlike prior work that performs either pixel-wise or full frame prediction, NIRVANA predicts patches across groups of frames. This allows it to exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy in videos to achieve efficient compression. 

NIRVANA works by splitting a video into groups of frames and fitting a separate network to each group. The networks perform patch-wise prediction, taking in patch centroid coordinates as input and outputting corresponding patch volumes across the frame group. Each network is initialized using the trained weights from the previous group's network, allowing temporal redundancy to be leveraged. To compress the networks, weight residuals between groups are quantized and encoded. Experiments show NIRVANA achieves 12x faster encoding than prior work NeRV, with similar quality and compression rate. It also naturally adapts to varying spatial resolutions and longer videos without modification. Ablations demonstrate the benefits of the patch-wise prediction and network initialization. Overall, NIRVANA provides an efficient neural implicit video compression method by exploiting spatio-temporal redundancy in an autoregressive framework.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes NIRVANA, a neural implicit representation method for video compression. The key idea is to treat videos as groups of frames and fit separate neural networks to each group that perform patch-wise prediction. This allows the model to exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy in videos. The video representation is modeled autoregressively, where the network for each frame group is initialized using the weights from the previous group's model. This enables encoding longer videos without changing the architecture. The networks are trained with quantization of the weights, avoiding post-training pruning or quantization. Only the differences between the quantized weights of the current and previous networks are encoded to achieve compression. This approach results in faster encoding times and the ability to adapt compression rates to the video content compared to prior video implicit neural representation methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new method called NIRVANA for neural implicit video compression. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for high-quality video compression, but existing methods have limitations in encoding speed, adaptability to video content, and scalability to longer videos or higher resolutions. 

- The key idea of NIRVANA is to treat videos as groups of frames and fit separate networks to each group that perform patch-wise prediction. This shares computation to improve encoding speed. The video representation is modeled autoregressively where networks for later groups are initialized from earlier ones to exploit temporal redundancy. 

- NIRVANA performs quantization of network weights during training itself to reduce size, rather than post-hoc pruning/quantization as in prior works like NeRV. This makes the compression rate adaptive to video content.

- Experiments show NIRVANA achieves 12x faster encoding than NeRV with similar quality and compression rate on the UVG benchmark. It also adapts better to higher resolution, longer videos, and variable bitrate compression based on inter-frame motion. The decoding is 6x faster and it scales linearly with more GPUs.

In summary, the key contribution is a new autoregressive patch-wise video INR method called NIRVANA that improves encoding speed, adaptability, and scalability compared to prior video INR works. The experiments demonstrate the practicality of the approach.
