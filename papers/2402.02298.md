# [Polyp-DAM: Polyp segmentation via depth anything model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate segmentation of colon polyps in endoscopic images is important for early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, existing methods either rely on fine-tuning large models which is computationally expensive or have limited performance. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new method called Polyp-DAM which introduces depth priors from the Depth Anything Model (DAM) to assist polyp segmentation. Specifically:

1) The input image is passed through the frozen pre-trained DAM model to generate a depth map distinguishing polyps from background. 

2) The depth map is concatenated channel-wise with the input image at multiple scales and fed into a proposed lightweight CNN called M^2ixNet.

3) M^2ixNet efficiently captures global context via dimension permutations and local features via 3D convolutions in a mixer-style architecture.

4) Deep supervision with combined loss functions is used during training for optimization.

Main Contributions:

- First work to introduce DAM for providing depth priors to polyp segmentation task
- Proposes a lightweight and efficient CNN architecture called M^2ixNet to incorporate global and local modeling 
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance across 5 public datasets with only 0.47M parameters
- Demonstrates generalizability and robustness to poor imaging conditions 

The main novelty is in using DAM for providing informative depth priors to assist polyp segmentation, while efficiently fusing this with the input via a compact and effective network design. Extensive experiments validate the performance and efficiency gains of this method over previous state-of-the-art techniques.
