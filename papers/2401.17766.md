## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Learning: Advances, Challenges, and Prospects":

Problem: 
Conventional zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods learn a mapping from visual features to semantics at a coarse, global level, which limits their performance for fine-grained recognition tasks where intra-class variation is large. Recent work has started integrating fine-grained analysis into ZSL to mitigate issues like domain bias and misaligned mappings. However, there lacks a systematic review of this emerging area of "fine-grained ZSL" (FZSL).

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive review of FZSL methods and techniques. The key aspects covered are:

- Taxonomy: Categories FZSL methods into attention-based and non-attention-based, with further subgroups (e.g. attribute attention, visual attention, cross attention, prototype learning, etc). Analyzes the motivation and techniques behind each group.

- Library: Summarizes FZSL benchmarks - common datasets, model details like backbones used and training strategies, implementation links. This facilitates easy access to resources for future research.  

- Applications: Highlights use of FZSL in areas like few-shot learning, scene understanding, open environment applications, and model robustness. This opens up avenues for interdisciplinary research.

- Challenges and Opportunities: Discusses limitations of current methods such as annotation cost/quality issues, deployment costs for resource-constrained platforms, and lack of theoretical foundations. Suggests promising future directions.

Main Contributions:

- First systematic taxonomy and thorough analysis of attention-based and non-attention based FZSL methods

- Library of datasets, model details, codes to enable easy access to resources

- Review of current and potential applications of FZSL 

- Discussion of open challenges and future opportunities to guide progress

Overall, the paper comprehensively reviews the FZSL landscape, sets up a basis for future research, and provides directions to enable advances in this emerging area.
