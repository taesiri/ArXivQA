# [MonoNPHM: Dynamic Head Reconstruction from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06740)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing high-quality 3D heads from monocular RGB videos is an important but challenging task due to depth ambiguity, complex facial movements, lighting effects, and lack of strong model priors. Existing methods using 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) or per-scene avatars have limitations in topological flexibility, detail, and generalization. 

Method:
This paper proposes MonoNPHM, a neural parametric head model tailored for monocular RGB face tracking. The model represents geometry using a canonical signed distance field (SDF) and texture field conditioned on geometry features. Facial expressions are modeled using a backward deformation field from posed to canonical space, augmented with hyperdimensions to increase topological flexibility. For tracking, volumetric NeuS rendering with SH lighting approximates images while landmark projection provides coarse guidance. Latent codes for identity, expression and lighting are optimized using losses on rendered RGB, silhouette, and 2D landmarks.

Contributions:
- MonoNPHM, a neural parametric head model with disentangled shape, expression and appearance spaces, and deformation augmentation for topology changes
- Tight coupling between texture field and geometry features enables meaningful appearance gradients during optimization
- Facial landmark loss using anchor points from implicit geometry to guide expressions
- State-of-the-art monocular face tracking, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming baselines by 20% in accuracy

The method represents advances in bringing the modeling capacity of neural fields to monocular face reconstruction through a tailored parametric formulation, losses for tracking, and strong quantitative results. It significantly pushes the boundary of reconstructing detailed 3D heads from monocular RGB input.
