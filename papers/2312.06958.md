# [PatchMorph: A Stochastic Deep Learning Approach for Unsupervised 3D   Brain Image Registration with Small Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06958)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces PatchMorph, a new deep learning approach for unsupervised 3D medical image registration. PatchMorph operates on small, constant-size image patches across multiple scales in a coarse-to-fine cascade, enabling both global alignment and local deformation while minimizing GPU memory usage. A key innovation is the ability to handle images with differing sizes, spacings, and orientations by directly sampling patches from the original arrays using provided world coordinate transformations. PatchMorph achieves superior registration performance on human brain MRI scans from the MindBoggle dataset compared to methods like ANTs, VoxelMorph, and implicit neural representations, while also generalizing well to microscope images of marmoset brains. The compact patch size allows more sophisticated network architectures to be employed in the future. Overall, PatchMorph provides an accurate and efficient framework for multiscale medical image registration that balances global and local attributes.
