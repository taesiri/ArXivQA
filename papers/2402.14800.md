# [Not All Experts are Equal: Efficient Expert Pruning and Skipping for   Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models like Mixtral can achieve higher performance than traditional transformers with fewer parameters. However, they are still difficult to deploy due to their large memory footprint.  
- Existing weight pruning methods require specialized hardware and focus on unstructured/semi-structured sparsity rather than expert-level sparsity.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes post-training methods for task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning to permanently remove less important experts. This significantly reduces memory usage.
- A dynamic expert skipping method is also introduced to skip certain experts during inference to further improve speed, which can be combined with expert pruning.

Main Contributions:
- First work to propose post-training expert pruning and dynamic expert skipping techniques to enhance deployment efficiency of MoE models.
- Expert pruning method outperforms weight pruning baselines. Pruning 2 experts reduces memory usage allowing deployment on 1 GPU instead of 2, with only 2.9 points drop in accuracy.
- First to consider task-specific expert pruning, showing much better retention of domain knowledge compared to using a general dataset. Fine-tuning can recover most of the loss.
- Dynamic skipping brings over 20% speedup on top of expert pruning with minimal additional accuracy drop.
- Overall, the methods can reduce memory usage by 50% and improve inference speed by over 30% with very slight impact on accuracy. Allows more efficient deployment of large MoE models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes post-training methods for expert pruning and dynamic expert skipping to improve the deployment efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts language models by reducing memory usage and increasing inference speed while maintaining performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing post-training methods for task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning and dynamic (expert) skipping of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs) to improve their deployment efficiency. Specifically:

1) They propose an efficient post-training approach to prune less important experts to minimize token reconstruction loss, reducing memory usage for deploying MoE LLMs. This is done in a layer-wise manner by enumerating expert combinations and choosing the one with lowest token reconstruction loss.

2) They propose task-specific expert pruning using samples from domain-specific datasets (e.g. mathematics) rather than just a general pre-training dataset. This better retains performance on downstream tasks from that domain after pruning.

3) They propose a dynamic expert skipping method during inference to accelerate the inference speed of MoE LLMs without compromising robustness. This allows on-the-fly adjustment of the number of active experts.

4) They demonstrate combining expert pruning and dynamic skipping can further enhance deployment efficiency of MoE LLMs, significantly reducing memory usage and increasing inference speed while maintaining satisfactory performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes both task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning strategies. What are the key differences between these two strategies and what motivates the need for a task-specific approach?

2. The dynamic expert skipping method decides at inference time whether to skip low-weighted experts based on a threshold hyperparameter β. How is β determined in the paper's experiments and what impacts would different choices of β have on model accuracy and speed?  

3. The paper argues that existing weight pruning methods like Wanda rely on specialized hardware for efficiency gains. Can you elaborate on the hardware limitations of these methods and how the proposed expert pruning avoids these issues?

4. Could the idea of changing the calibration dataset for domain-specific expert pruning be applied to other model compression techniques like weight pruning and quantization? What challenges might this present?

5. The expert pruning method optimizes the reconstruction loss between the original model and pruned model on a calibration set. What other metrics could be used during this search process and what tradeoffs do they present?

6. How does the tendency for expert selection demonstrated in Figure 5 impact the design and effectiveness of the pruning and skipping algorithms? Are certain experts more critical than others?

7. The paper experiments with the Mixtral 8x7B model which has 8 experts per layer. How would the methods scale to models with significantly more experts per layer? What algorithmic or performance challenges might arise?

8. Could the idea of dynamic expert skipping be applied during training rather than just at inference time? What benefits or drawbacks would this have?  

9. The paper analyzes the combination of expert pruning and dynamic skipping. What other MoE model compression techniques could these methods be combined with and why?

10. The method is analyzed on decoder-only transformer models. How might the techniques change for encoder-decoder models and what additional evaluations would be needed?
