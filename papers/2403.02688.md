## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Photonic accelerators for AI workloads are highly promising due to speed and efficiency, but suffer from reliability issues due to hardware noise and variations, especially thermal effects in components like microring resonators (MRRs). 
- Pre-deployment optimizations are ineffective for dynamic, temporally drifting variations. Recent on-chip training methods help but require costly training with backpropagation and labeled datasets.
- There is a need for a lightweight, efficient, in-situ calibration mechanism without labeled data to provide real-time accuracy recovery against drifting variations.

Proposed Solution - \doctor Framework
- Models thermal variations rigorously - phase noise, temperature drift, crosstalk. Analyzes sensitivity.  
- Salience-aware Sparse Calibration:
    - Training-free, data-free in-situ calibration via regression to cancel variations and resume accuracy.
    - Uses salience scores to prioritize calibrating important weights, enabling sparsity.
    - Very efficient (no backpropagation through layers). Decoupled from task/datasets.
- Variation-Aware Tile Remapping:
    - Leverages non-uniform spatial distribution of noises. 
    - Optimally remaps workload matrix blocks onto tensor cores to minimize errors, aware of weight importance and device noise levels.
- Adaptive Remediation Controller:
    - Dynamically monitors temperature and triggers remediation actions based on thresholds to avoid frequent interrupts.

Key Contributions:
- Provides first on-chip remediation approach with calibration and remapping for real-time accuracy recovery against temporally drifting variations.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art on-chip training methods substantially in accuracy and efficiency.
- Enables sustained performance of photonic accelerators with negligible overhead, making significant strides toward robust deployment.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a lightweight dynamic on-chip remediation framework called DOCTOR to provide adaptive, in-situ accuracy recovery against temporally drifting noises in photonic tensor accelerators. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) Thermal variation modeling: Rigorously modeling and analyzing the dynamic thermal variations in multi-core photonic accelerators, including device phase variations, environmental temperature drifts, and inter-device thermal crosstalks. 

2) Salience-aware sparse calibration: Proposing a training-free, data-free in-situ calibration method to selectively cancel out device variations and efficiently resume accuracy with negligible overhead. It prioritizes calibrating important weights based on salience scores.

3) Variation-aware tile remapping: Leveraging the non-uniform spatial noise distributions across devices to boost reliability by optimally remapping workloads onto tensor cores based on weight importance and device noise levels.  

4) An adaptive remediation controller to dynamically monitor the chip status and determine when to trigger the calibration and remapping procedures.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an efficient on-chip remediation framework to guarantee sustained performance under drifting variations in photonic accelerators.
