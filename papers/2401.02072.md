# [ICE-GRT: Instruction Context Enhancement by Generative Reinforcement   based Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT often struggle with domain-specific tasks that require in-depth technical knowledge. 
- Supervised fine-tuned LLMs tend to lose some general capabilities when specialized for certain tasks.
- Smaller LLMs lack detailed analysis abilities compared to very large models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose ICE-GRT, which utilizes reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) to enhance LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- ICE-GRT shows strong performance on domain-specific tasks without losing general capabilities. For example, it can not only determine ad policy compliance but also suggest constructive modifications.
- On 12 language task benchmarks, ICE-GRT (13B parameters) achieves state-of-the-art results compared to LLMs of equivalent and even much larger size.
- Analysis reveals crucial factors for ICE-GRT's success: Appropriate training data from the ICE-Instruct model, reward scaling, KL-control, advantage normalization etc.
- The training process has 3 key phases: knowledge learning (pretraining), knowledge mining (supervised fine-tuning), and knowledge enhancement (RLHF) which aligns the LLM with human preferences.
- The authors open-source ICE-GRT to facilitate research into enhancing LLMs with RLHF.

In summary, ICE-GRT pushes LLMs to a new level, with exceptional domain-specific abilities and strong general performance. The analysis also provides insights into effective LLM training.
