# [Toward Interactive Dictation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04008)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is the feasibility of allowing users to interrupt their speech dictation with spoken editing commands in open-ended natural language. Specifically, the paper asks whether it is possible to build a system that can:

1. Incrementally segment a continuous speech stream into dictation vs. commands.

2. Interpret the spans classified as commands in order to edit the document, even when the commands are in unrestricted natural language rather than following fixed templates. 

The key hypotheses are:

- It is possible to collect a dataset of natural interactive dictation trajectories with gold segmentations and interpretations, using a novel data collection interface.

- Pre-trained language models can be used to build models that achieve reasonable accuracy on the subtasks of segmentation, normalization, and interpretation for this task.

- There is a tradeoff between model accuracy and latency, where smaller models can achieve lower latency at the cost of lower accuracy on command interpretation.

So in summary, the central research question is about the feasibility of open-ended natural language commanding interleaved with dictation, and the key hypotheses relate to collecting suitable training data and building models for the task. Evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of different modeling approaches on the dataset is posed as an initial investigation of the core research question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal and investigation of a new task called interactive dictation. Specifically:

- They introduce the task of interactive dictation, where users can interleave free-form dictation with open-ended natural language commands to edit the text, all in a single continuous speech stream. This is more flexible than existing voice dictation systems that only allow a limited set of predefined editing commands.

- They collect a new dataset called TERTIUS for this task by having humans demonstrate interactive dictation trajectories. The dataset contains timestamped speech audio, ASR transcripts, segmentation into dictation vs. commands, normalized forms of commands, and document state updates.

- They design a pipeline system for the task involving modules for segmentation, normalization, and interpretation. They experiment with using pre-trained language models (T5 and GPT-3) for interpretation, predicting either edited text directly or text-editing programs.

- Their experiments analyze tradeoffs between model accuracy and latency. They show a smaller T5 model can achieve decent accuracy (28% on single command interpretation) with low latency (1.3 sec), while a larger GPT-3 model gets higher accuracy (55%) but with much higher latency (7 sec).

In summary, the key contribution is proposing this new challenging task, collecting a dataset for it, and conducting initial experiments on models and their accuracy/latency tradeoffs. The paper helps drive progress on more flexible voice-based document editing.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new task and dataset for flexible voice-based text editing, where users can dictate and make open-ended corrections/commands in a single speech stream; it also explores trade-offs between model accuracy and latency when building such a system.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of speech-to-text editing systems:

- This paper introduces a new task of "interactive dictation" that allows users to interleave open-ended natural language commands with dictation in a continuous speech stream. This is more flexible than most prior work, which relies on predefined command templates/triggers. The open-ended nature of the commands is a novel contribution.

- The paper collects a new dataset, TERTIUS, to support research on this task. Having a dedicated dataset focused on interleaved dictation and commanding will be valuable for the field. Prior datasets have generally focused on either pure dictation or standalone editing/commanding.

- The paper experiments with using large pretrained language models (LLMs) like T5 and GPT-3 for interpreting commands and editing text, similar to some recent work applying LLMs as text editing assistants. However, a key difference is this work looks at spoken commands in an interactive setting rather than written commands.

- The paper introduces the idea of predicting text-editing programs from commands, as opposed to directly predicting edited text. Using programs as an intermediate representation for editing is a technique used in some prior work on text generation/editing, but hasn't been explored as much for speech commands.

- The paper analyzes tradeoffs between prediction accuracy and latency when using different model architectures. This analysis of efficiency is important for real-time interactive systems but less thoroughly examined in some prior editing papers.

Overall, the novel dataset, flexible task formulation, experiments with LLMs, and analysis of efficiency tradeoffs seem like good contributions compared to prior work. The model results are decent but still have room for improvement in accuracy and speed. Testing whether the approach works with real users through user studies is an important next step.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

- Push out the Pareto frontier in terms of model accuracy vs. efficiency by exploring techniques like model distillation to improve speed and training on larger datasets to improve accuracy.

- Extend the system and dataset to domains beyond work emails, such as social media, text messages, notes, etc.

- Incorporate other types of text transformation commands beyond editing, such as formatting. 

- Allow the system to respond to the user in ways beyond just updating the text, such as asking clarifying questions.

- Use prosodic information from the speech signal to help with tasks like segmentation.

- Leverage ASR lattices and n-best lists to help resolve references, correct mistranscriptions, etc.

- Move beyond a pipeline of separately trained modules to an end-to-end trained system.

- Scale up data collection with a learned model in the loop, to create trajectories reflecting actual system behavior.

- Evaluate with real users, once the system is performant enough.

- Expand to more languages, dialects, and accents.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: improving accuracy and efficiency, broadening the scope, incorporating additional modalities like prosody, exploring end-to-end training, collecting larger datasets reflecting real system use, and evaluating with real users.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the task of interactive dictation, where users can interleave natural language commands with free-form dictation in order to edit text via voice input. The authors collect a new dataset, TERTIUS, to support research on this task. They design a novel data collection interface that allows capturing time-aligned transcriptions, segmentations, normalizations, and state updates as users dictate and command. The dataset contains 1320 interactive dictation trajectories with over 4000 utterance segments. To address the task, the paper proposes a pipeline consisting of an ASR module, a segmentation module, a normalization module, and an interpretation module. They experiment with using pre-trained language models like T5 and GPT-3 for the interpretation module, finding a trade-off between model size and latency - smaller models are faster but less accurate. They also compare directly predicting target text states versus predicting text-editing programs. Overall, the work demonstrates the feasibility of flexible, open-ended commanding and editing during speech dictation, and introduces a novel dataset and preliminary models to make progress on this task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the task of interactive dictation, where users can interleave natural language commands with dictation in order to edit text through speech. The authors created a novel dataset called TERTIUS for this task by having annotators dictate emails while specifying segmentation between dictation and commands. They also designed a text editing language that annotators used to provide programs representing the semantics of each command. 

The authors built a system with modules for speech recognition, segmentation, normalization, and interpretation. They experimented with using T5 and GPT-3 models for normalization and interpretation, predicting either the edited text directly or programs in their text editing language. They found a trade-off between model accuracy and latency, with smaller T5 models being faster but less accurate while prompted GPT-3 models were slower but achieved higher accuracy. Overall the work makes progress towards flexible text editing through speech by defining the task, collecting data, and building an initial system.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new task called interactive dictation, where users can interleave natural language commands with dictation in order to edit text through speech. To enable this, the authors collect a new dataset called TERTIUS where annotators demonstrate trajectories of dictating and commanding to accomplish email writing tasks. They build a pipeline system with four components: an off-the-shelf ASR system, a segmentation model to classify ASR transcript spans as dictation or command, a normalization model to repair ASR errors in commands, and an interpretation model to either directly predict edited text or predict text editing programs from commands. They experiment with using T5 and GPT-3 for the normalization and interpretation models, finding a tradeoff between model size and speed - a smaller T5 model runs faster with lower accuracy while larger GPT-3 is slower but more accurate. The experiments and dataset enable future research on real-time natural language speech editing.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of enabling flexible and natural voice editing in speech dictation systems. Existing commercial dictation systems have limitations in supporting voice editing, often requiring users to speak templated commands with predefined trigger words. This paper proposes a new task and dataset for open-ended natural language commanding intermixed with dictation. The main questions addressed are:

- How to collect natural data for this task, where users can freely dictate and command to edit the text? They design a novel data collection interface to allow fluid switching between dictation and commanding.

- How should the system process the continuous speech stream, to segment it into dictation vs. commands, normalize the commands, and execute the appropriate edits to the text? They build a pipeline model with separate components for segmentation, normalization, and interpretation.

- What are effective strategies for command interpretation, balancing accuracy and latency? They compare predicting edited text directly vs. predicting short text-editing programs, and using small vs. large pretrained language models.

- How to make the system work incrementally and handle streaming/changing ASR results? They implement change propagation through the components and introduce a "commit point" for efficiency.

In summary, the key focus is on how to design an end-to-end system for interactive dictation that allows flexible natural language commanding intermixed with dictation in real-time. The paper explores dataset creation, model design, accuracy vs. efficiency tradeoffs, and incremental processing.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords are:

- Interactive dictation - The core task studied in the paper, where users can interleave natural language commands with dictation in a continuous speech stream.

- Segmentation - A key subtask, where the system must detect when the user switches from dictation to command mode. Requires identifying boundaries between dictation and command utterances.  

- Interpretation - Another key subtask, where the system must understand the user's commands expressed in natural language and execute the appropriate text edits.

- Flexibility - A goal of the system is to support flexible natural language commanding without constrained vocabulary or templates.

- Dataset - The authors collect a new dataset called TERTIUS to support research on interactive dictation.

- Latency - A key consideration is the tradeoff between accuracy and latency, as some complex models are too slow for real-time use.

- Programs - One approach is to interpret commands by predicting text-editing programs, which are faster but less accurate.

- Pretrained language models - Large models like GPT-3 and T5 are used and compared for the subtasks.

- Change propagation - Updating previous outputs when the ASR transcript changes to keep the document state consistent.

So in summary, the key themes are interactive dictation, segmentation, interpretation, flexibility, latency, datasets, programs, and pretrained language models. The core goals are supporting natural language editing in real-time speech dictation.
