# [Online Adaptation of Sampling-Based Motion Planning with Inaccurate   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Robotic manipulation systems often rely on inaccurate analytical or learned models of the dynamics to plan motions. This can lead to failures during execution when there is a mismatch between the predicted and actual system behavior (e.g. unexpected collisions due to trajectory tracking errors). While methods exist to propagate model uncertainty during planning or discard unreliable actions, they require complex uncertainty modeling over the whole state-action space. Moreover, even minor mismatches between the simulation and real system can cause failures.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose an online adaptation approach for sampling-based motion planning that leverages execution feedback to correct the planning strategy. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce a context vector to represent local environmental features around each executed transition. This captures things like obstacles in the vicinity. 

2) Use an anomaly detection method on execution errors to label some past transitions as unreliable.

3) Define a context-based similarity function between transitions, based on comparing their context vectors. This allows inferring if a new simulated transition will be unreliable even if it is far away in state-action space from past ones.  

4) Adapt the planner's cost function to penalize new transitions that have high similarity with previously unreliable ones. Also adapt the sampling distribution to undersample such transitions.

The adaptive planning framework is built on top of an existing MAB-RRT method that does online clustering of transitions and balances exploration vs. exploitation. Here the clustering uses the new context-based similarity, and rewards of clusters with unreliable transitions are reduced.

Main Contributions:

- A context-aware similarity function between transitions that helps generalize information about unreliable transitions

- An adaptive cost function and sampling bias for online replanning in inaccurate systems

- Demonstrated improved success rate and sample efficiency on 2D navigation problems and a 7-DOF real-world manipulation task

The approach allows the robot to leverage online observations to discourage unreliable motions during replanning, without needing complex uncertainty propagation or model updates. Limitations include reliance on hand-defined context representations. Overall, the method enables more reliable planning in systems with inaccurate models by correcting the planning strategy online based on execution feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adaptive sampling-based motion planning approach that uses estimates of model error and online observations to correct the planning strategy by discouraging transitions that are likely to fail during execution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive sampling-based motion planning approach that uses an estimate of the model error and online observations to correct the planning strategy at each new replanning. Specifically:

- It introduces the concept of "context-aware similarity", which allows the planner to infer whether new simulated transitions will be unreliable during execution even if they are far from previous ones in the state-action space. This is done by storing local environment information for each executed transition. 

- It adapts the cost function used for replanning by assigning a penalty term based on the probability that a transition is unreliable (i.e. if its context is similar to a previous unreliable transition).

- It adapts the sampling distribution of the RRT-based planner using a multi-armed bandit framework to undersample transitions that have a high probability of being unreliable based on their context.

- It demonstrates through simulations and experiments that the approach increases the execution success rate and reduces the number of necessary replannings to reach the goal compared to non-adaptive baselines.

In summary, the key innovation is the use of context-aware similarity and online observations to adapt both the cost function and sampling distribution of a sampling-based planner to avoid unreliable transitions during replanning. This makes the planner more robust to inaccuracies in the models used for planning.

The paper proposes an approach to adapt sampling-based motion planning algorithms by using online observations to correct the cost function and sampling distribution. Key ideas include detecting unreliable/anomalous transitions, defining a context vector to measure similarity between transitions, updating the cost function to penalize unreliable transitions, and adapting the sampling distribution using multi-armed bandits and context-based clustering. The goal is to increase the success rate and reduce replanning for motion planning problems with inaccurate models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the context-aware similarity measure for transitions allow the planner to generalize information about unreliable transitions to new areas of the state-action space? What assumptions does this make?

2) The paper mentions that automatically defining the context-aware similarity measure is an open question for future work. What approaches could you propose to learn this similarity measure in a generalizable way?

3) How does updating both the cost function and sampling distribution allow the method to better avoid unreliable regions during replanning? What is the intuition behind needing both adaptations? 

4) The method relies on being able to detect when a transition was unreliable during execution. What factors could make this challenging or error-prone? How could the method be made robust to inaccurate unreliability labels?

5) How does the method balance exploitation of low-cost regions found earlier in the search with continued exploration? Could changes to the MAB strategy further improve performance?

6) What theoretical guarantees does the method provide on convergence or asymptotic optimality? If none, what modifications could provide such guarantees? 

7) How does the performance of the method scale with the dimensionality and complexity of the state/action spaces? Are there ways to improve computational tractability?

8) The cluster "poisoning" method weights all samples in a cluster equally based on presence of unreliable samples. Could a more nuanced weighting improve performance?

9) The method relies on access to reasonable estimates of model error offline. How could the approach be extended to problems where this is unavailable?

10) The paper focuses on robotic manipulation examples. What other potential application domains could benefit from this replanning approach? What domain-specific modifications might be needed?
