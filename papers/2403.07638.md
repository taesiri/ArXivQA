# [Online Adaptation of Sampling-Based Motion Planning with Inaccurate   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Robotic manipulation systems often rely on inaccurate analytical or learned models of the dynamics to plan motions. This can lead to failures during execution when there is a mismatch between the predicted and actual system behavior (e.g. unexpected collisions due to trajectory tracking errors). While methods exist to propagate model uncertainty during planning or discard unreliable actions, they require complex uncertainty modeling over the whole state-action space. Moreover, even minor mismatches between the simulation and real system can cause failures.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose an online adaptation approach for sampling-based motion planning that leverages execution feedback to correct the planning strategy. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce a context vector to represent local environmental features around each executed transition. This captures things like obstacles in the vicinity. 

2) Use an anomaly detection method on execution errors to label some past transitions as unreliable.

3) Define a context-based similarity function between transitions, based on comparing their context vectors. This allows inferring if a new simulated transition will be unreliable even if it is far away in state-action space from past ones.  

4) Adapt the planner's cost function to penalize new transitions that have high similarity with previously unreliable ones. Also adapt the sampling distribution to undersample such transitions.

The adaptive planning framework is built on top of an existing MAB-RRT method that does online clustering of transitions and balances exploration vs. exploitation. Here the clustering uses the new context-based similarity, and rewards of clusters with unreliable transitions are reduced.

Main Contributions:

- A context-aware similarity function between transitions that helps generalize information about unreliable transitions

- An adaptive cost function and sampling bias for online replanning in inaccurate systems

- Demonstrated improved success rate and sample efficiency on 2D navigation problems and a 7-DOF real-world manipulation task

The approach allows the robot to leverage online observations to discourage unreliable motions during replanning, without needing complex uncertainty propagation or model updates. Limitations include reliance on hand-defined context representations. Overall, the method enables more reliable planning in systems with inaccurate models by correcting the planning strategy online based on execution feedback.
