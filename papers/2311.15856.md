# [JSSL: Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning for MRI   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15856)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel training approach called Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL) for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction models. JSSL is designed for scenarios where ground truth fully sampled MRI data is unavailable for the target dataset, which is common in real-world clinical settings. The key idea is to simultaneously train the model using 1) available subsampled target data in a self-supervised manner, and 2) fully sampled proxy data from other domains in a supervised fashion. Experiments demonstrate that JSSL substantially outperforms conventional self-supervised methods that rely solely on subsampled target data. Theoretical analysis provides intuition why combining proxy supervised learning and target self-supervised learning can improve reconstruction quality. The authors also offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal training strategies based on data availability. Overall, JSSL represents an important contribution for enabling high-quality MRI reconstruction for target domains lacking ground truth data, with demonstrations on a subsampled prostate imaging dataset using brain and knee MRI as proxies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel training approach called Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL) for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction that leverages both fully sampled proxy datasets and subsampled target datasets without ground truth to improve reconstruction quality over conventional self-supervised methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The proposed Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL) method represents the first approach to combine supervised and self-supervised learning training within a single pipeline for accelerated deep MRI reconstruction. 

2. The paper experimentally demonstrates that JSSL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to self-supervised deep learning-based MRI reconstruction approaches, with a specific focus on a subsampled prostate dataset.

3. The paper provides a theoretical motivation for the JSSL approach. 

4. The paper offers practical "rule-of-thumb" guidelines for selecting appropriate training frameworks for accelerated MRI reconstruction models.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel JSSL method that jointly leverages available fully sampled proxy datasets and subsampled target datasets lacking ground truth to train deep learning models for MRI reconstruction in a combined supervised and self-supervised manner. Experiments show this joint approach outperforms conventional self-supervised training methods.

The paper introduces a novel training methodology called Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL) for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction when there is no access to fully sampled (ground truth) data in the target domain. It leverages available fully sampled data from other domains (proxy datasets) and subsampled data from the target domain to train models in supervised and self-supervised manners simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over conventional self-supervised methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining supervised learning on proxy datasets with self-supervised learning on the target dataset. What is the intuition behind this approach? How does it theoretically help improve performance over just using self-supervised learning?

2. The ablation studies show that the joint supervised and self-supervised approach (JSSL) consistently outperforms just self-supervised learning. However, what are some potential reasons or scenarios where JSSL may not outperform regular SSL? 

3. The paper mentions using fully sampled brain and knee MRI scans as the proxy datasets. What properties should good proxy datasets have in order to maximize knowledge transfer and performance gains from JSSL?

4. Could semi-supervised learning be incorporated into the JSSL framework? What potential benefits or challenges might this introduce? How would you design the loss functions?

5. The paper focuses on MRI reconstruction, but could JSSL be applied to other inverse problems lacking fully sampled ground truth data? What modifications would need to be made?

6. How does the sample efficiency of JSSL compare to purely supervised or self-supervised methods? Could benefits still be observed if proxy datasets are small? 

7. Could the idea of JSSL be extended to use unpaired data between proxy and target datasets? How would you modify the approach?

8. The paper uses a U-Net architecture for reconstruction. How might performance change with other network architectures? What properties should they have?  

9. What are some potential failure cases or limitations of JSSL? When would you prefer a purely SSL or SL approach instead?

10. The authors provide practical guidelines for choosing training regimes. Do you agree with their recommendations? How might they be expanded or improved?
