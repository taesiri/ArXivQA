# [DISC-MedLLM: Bridging General Large Language Models and Real-World   Medical Consultation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14346)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How to develop comprehensive solutions and provide high-quality healthcare services to users through an end-to-end conversational system by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and incorporating intensive and reliable medical knowledge?The key points related to this research question are:- Previous studies on intelligent medical systems have focused on specific tasks or diseases with limited applicability, creating a gap between experimental advancements and practical applications. - To bridge this gap, there is a need for comprehensive solutions that can cover a broader range of medical scenarios.- The goal is to provide high-quality healthcare services to users in an end-to-end conversational manner.- Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for building such medical consultation systems.- However, general domain LLMs have limitations in handling complex medical consultations. - The proposed approach aims to incorporate intensive and reliable medical knowledge into LLMs to develop a solution called DISC-MedLLM that can provide accurate and truthful responses for healthcare services through conversation.So in summary, the central research question is about developing conversational medical LLMs that are knowledgeable, accurate and helpful for delivering end-to-end healthcare services to users. The key hypothesis is that incorporating intensive medical knowledge into LLMs can help bridge the gap between experimental progress and practical applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing DISC-MedLLM, a conversational medical language model aimed at providing high-quality medical consultations through natural language interactions. 2. Introducing a novel data construction and training process that distills knowledge, capabilities, and characteristics from both real-world doctor-patient dialogues and general domain LLMs like GPT-3.5. This process adapts the real dialogue distribution into an AI doctor-patient dialogue distribution.3. Constructing a high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset using strategies like medical knowledge graph-driven sampling, real-world dialogue reconstruction, and human preference-guided curation. 4. Demonstrating through experiments that DISC-MedLLM outperforms models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and other Chinese medical conversational LLMs in simulated medical consultation scenarios judged by GPT-4.5. Releasing the constructed SFT dataset and model weights to facilitate further research into conversational medical LLMs.In summary, the core contribution appears to be proposing a comprehensive training approach and conversational medical LLM that bridges the gap between general LLMs and real-world medical consultations. The model is shown to outperform prior medical LLMs through systematic evaluation.
