# [FediOS: Decoupling Orthogonal Subspaces for Personalization in   Feature-skew Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18559)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes FediOS, a novel personalized federated learning (pFL) approach to improve personalization performance under feature skew heterogeneity. Different from most existing pFL methods focusing on label distribution skew, FediOS tackles the more challenging problem of feature skew among clients. The key innovation is the architecture decoupling design - instead of splitting the model into a shared feature extractor and dual prediction heads as previous works do, FediOS decouples feature extractors through orthogonal projections to map generic features into a common subspace and scatter personalized features into distinct orthogonal subspaces. This allows effective decoupling and sharing of generic knowledge while preserving personalized knowledge. Experiments on four vision datasets validate that FediOS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pFL baselines on personalization accuracy under feature skew. Moreover, by enabling better generalization through effective feature decoupling, FediOS also improves the global model performance. The results showcase that the proposed orthogonal projection-based decoupling scheme is an effective and efficient solution to personalization under feature heterogeneity.
