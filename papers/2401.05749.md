# [A Shocking Amount of the Web is Machine Translated: Insights from   Multi-Way Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05749)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The web contains a large amount of machine translated content, especially in lower resource languages. This raises concerns about using web-scraped data to train multilingual AI models, as machine translated data tends to be lower quality.

- There is evidence of selection bias in what content gets translated by machines into many languages. Lower quality English content seems to be getting translated en masse into other languages.

Methodology:
- The authors created a large multi-way parallel corpus called MWccMatrix with 6.4 billion unique sentences in 90 languages. This allows analyzing translations across languages.

- They measured translation quality using CometQE and analyzed topics, length and predictability of sentences based on how many languages they are translated into ("multi-way parallelism").

Key Findings:
- Highly multi-way parallel sentences are much lower quality, suggesting they are machine translated. In lower resource languages, most of the translated content is machine generated.

- Multi-way parallel content is shorter, more predictable, and over-represents "Conversation/Opinion" topics. This indicates selection bias in what gets machine translated.

- There are signs that low quality English content gets translated by machines into many languages. This over-represents such content in those languages.

Implications:
- Machine translated content likely dominates both bilingual and monolingual web data in lower resource languages. This is a serious concern for multilingual model training.

- Multi-way parallelism could help detect low quality machine translated content to filter. Topic analysis also reveals the selection biases.

Overall the paper provides in-depth analysis of an important issue around using web data for AI training. The MWccMatrix resource could enable further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper shows that a large fraction of web content, especially in low-resource languages, consists of low-quality machine translations, raising concerns about training multilingual models on web data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is showing that a large fraction of content on the web, especially in lower resource languages, consists of low quality machine translations. Specifically:

- They find that over half of the sentences in their multi-way parallel corpus extracted from Common Crawl are in tuples with 3+ languages, indicating widespread machine translation.

- Translations with higher levels of multi-way parallelism are lower quality, based on automatic quality estimation metrics, providing further evidence that they are machine translations. 

- In lower resource languages, machine translated content dominates the available translations and constitutes a large fraction of total web content.

- There is evidence of selection bias in the types of content translated - it tends to be shorter, more predictable, and from different topics compared to content translated to only one other language. This suggests questionable quality English content is being mass translated via MT.

The implications are that web crawled data, especially in low resource languages, contains a lot of low quality machine translated content which could be problematic for training multilingual models. The paper also provides suggestions for detecting and filtering out this type of noisy data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Machine translation (MT)
- Multi-way parallelism
- Web scraping
- Data quality
- Selection bias
- Low resource languages
- Machine translated content
- Bitext mining
- Multilingual models
- Training data

The paper explores how the availability of machine translation has led to a large amount of low quality, machine translated content on the web, especially in translations to low resource languages. It analyzes this using a multi-way parallel corpus extracted from Common Crawl. The key themes include the prevalence of machine translation on the web, the lower quality of multi-way parallel translations, selection bias in what content gets translated, and implications for training multilingual AI models on web scraped data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using multi-way parallelism to detect machine translated content on the web. What are some potential limitations or challenges with using multi-way parallelism for this purpose? For example, could some human-translated content also exhibit high levels of multi-way parallelism?

2. The paper finds that higher levels of multi-way parallelism correlate with lower quality translation. However, could this relationship differ across language pairs or domains? Are there certain settings where high multi-way parallelism may not indicate lower quality?

3. The authors use CometQE for translation quality estimation. How might using other QE methods impact the observed relationship between multi-way parallelism and quality? Could this relationship be an artifact of something inherent to CometQE?

4. The proposed method for creating the MWccMatrix corpus involves extensive deduplication and joining of translation tuples. What impact could errors or inconsistencies introduced in these steps have on downstream analysis? How might you verify the integrity of the resulting corpus?

5. The authors perform only limited investigation into the causes of the observed topic distribution differences between levels of multi-way parallelism. What further analysis could be done to more definitively attribute this to low quality English content being translated via MT?

6. The analysis relies heavily on the ccMatrix corpus. How well might the findings generalize to other web-scraped corpora? What differences in corpus creation approach may impact observed levels of multi-way parallelism?

7. The authors suggest MT detection and multi-way parallelism filtering as ways to address problems from machine translated data. What practical challenges would need to be overcome to implement these filtering approaches on a massive scale?

8. What alternative indicators of machine translated or low quality content could be used instead of or in addition to multi-way parallelism? How do you think they might compare?

9. How robust is the relationship between multi-way parallelism and quality over time? Could advances in MT impact it? Could analysis of historical trends provide more insight?

10. The analysis is performed at the sentence level. How might analysis at the document-level differ? Could high document-level multi-way parallelism indicate something different than high sentence-level multi-way parallelism?
