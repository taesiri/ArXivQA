# [Dimensionality-Varying Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16032)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that it is not necessary to maintain a high-dimensional signal throughout the entire diffusion process for generative modeling of images. Specifically, the authors argue that:

1. Images contain spatial redundancy, so the signal can be represented in a lower-dimensional space, especially in the early steps of the generation process where details are still coarse. 

2. By decomposing the image signal into orthogonal components and attenuating the components separately, the dimensionality of the signal can be reduced over the course of the diffusion process with minimal information loss.

3. This allows the use of lower-dimensional signals in the diffusion modeling framework, which reduces computational costs for both training and inference without sacrificing sample quality.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that dynamically varying the dimensionality over the course of the diffusion process can improve efficiency of diffusion models for image synthesis while maintaining sample fidelity. Theoretical analysis and experiments are provided to support this central premise.
