# [SDC-UDA: Volumetric Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Framework for   Slice-Direction Continuous Cross-Modality Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11012)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for cross-modality medical image segmentation that achieves continuous segmentation performance in the slice direction?The key hypotheses are:1) Incorporating intra- and inter-slice self-attention in image translation will lead to improved anatomy preservation and slice-direction smoothness in the synthesized volumes. 2) Volumetric self-training with uncertainty-constrained pseudo-label refinement will help adapt the model to the target domain and maximize the effect of self-training.3) Considering volumetric information in both image translation and segmentation will result in continuous segmentation performance in the slice direction, which is important for clinical use.The paper proposes the SDC-UDA framework to address these hypotheses and achieve slice-direction continuous segmentation through volume-aware image translation and segmentation. The experiments validate these hypotheses by showing state-of-the-art performance and superior slice-direction continuity compared to previous methods.
