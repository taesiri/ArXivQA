# [SDC-UDA: Volumetric Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Framework for   Slice-Direction Continuous Cross-Modality Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11012)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we develop an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for cross-modality medical image segmentation that achieves continuous segmentation performance in the slice direction?The key hypotheses are:1) Incorporating intra- and inter-slice self-attention in image translation will lead to improved anatomy preservation and slice-direction smoothness in the synthesized volumes. 2) Volumetric self-training with uncertainty-constrained pseudo-label refinement will help adapt the model to the target domain and maximize the effect of self-training.3) Considering volumetric information in both image translation and segmentation will result in continuous segmentation performance in the slice direction, which is important for clinical use.The paper proposes the SDC-UDA framework to address these hypotheses and achieve slice-direction continuous segmentation through volume-aware image translation and segmentation. The experiments validate these hypotheses by showing state-of-the-art performance and superior slice-direction continuity compared to previous methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes SDC-UDA, a unified volumetric UDA framework for cross-modality medical image segmentation. 2. It introduces an intra- and inter-slice self-attention module for medical image translation that leads to increased anatomy preservation and slice-direction smoothness in the synthesized volumes.3. It proposes a novel uncertainty-constrained pseudo-label refinement strategy for volumetric self-training that can adaptively enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels, thereby maximizing the effect of self-training. 4. It validates SDC-UDA on multiple public datasets and shows state-of-the-art segmentation performance compared to previous methods. It also demonstrates superior slice-direction continuity of the segmentation results.In summary, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end volumetric UDA framework for cross-modality medical image segmentation that achieves improved performance and segmentation continuity in the slice direction. The key innovations are the intra-/inter-slice attentive image translation and the uncertainty-constrained pseudo-label refinement for volumetric self-training.
