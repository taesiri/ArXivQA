# [Unintended Impacts of LLM Alignment on Global Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15018)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exploded in popularity as AI assistants. Before deployment, developers "align" models to user preferences through procedures like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).  
- However, human preferences are not universal. Aligning to one group's preferences may negatively impact capabilities for other groups. This could limit adoption of LLMs globally.
- The paper explores the impact of alignment on 3 axes of global representation: English dialects, multilingualism, and global opinions.

Methods
- Analyze 9 LLMs, including popular models like Llama, Mistral, TÃ¼lu, Starling, and Zephyr. 
- Compare capabilities before alignment, after supervised fine-tuning, and after preference tuning on tasks covering global dialects, languages, and opinions.
- Datasets: Multi-Dialect Dataset (MD3) for dialects; TyDiQA and Belebele for languages; GlobalOpinionsQA and a new AskReddit opinions dataset for global opinions.

Key Findings
- Alignment improves MD3 performance more for US English than Indian or Nigerian English, increasing disparity between dialects.  
- Surprisingly, alignment often improves multilingual QA, likely due to unexpected multilingual data in fine-tuning sets.
- Alignment increases relative alignment with US opinions compared to China, Jordan, Nigeria per GlobalOpinionsQA. The Starling reward model also correlates highly with US opinions.

Main Contributions  
- First paper analyzing impacts of alignment on global capabilities, highlighting unintended effects.
- Recommendations for more equitable language model development.  
- New AskReddit dataset for probing country-specific opinions.
- Analysis spanning multiple popular open LLM families over full alignment pipeline.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how alignment to local preferences can negatively impact global capabilities, and provides recommendations to address this issue.
