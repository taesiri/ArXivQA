# [IMProv: Inpainting-based Multimodal Prompting for Computer Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01771)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces IMProv, an inpainting-based multimodal prompting model for in-context learning of computer vision tasks. The key idea is to train a masked autoencoder transformer on a new dataset of 268K figures from computer vision papers paired with captions, combined with the LAION-400M image-text dataset. During inference, the model receives a textual and/or visual prompt describing a task (e.g. "Left: input, Right: segmentation") and must fill in the output for a given input image. This allows adapting the model to new vision tasks without fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate clear improvements over vision-only prompting, with over 10% higher AP on foreground segmentation, 5% on detection, and 20% lower LPIPS on colorization. The results also reveal an interesting trade-off between visual and textual prompts - high-quality text can reduce the need for curated image examples. Comparisons to few-shot learning approaches reveal the model trains in a more generalizable self-supervised fashion, closing over 40% of the gap from no base training data. The emergent in-context learning shows promise towards adaptable computer vision systems. Key limitations are needing high-quality textual prompts and not matching 1-shot supervised performance. Overall, the work makes excellent progress blending vision, language and in-context learning.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In-context learning (ICL) allows adapting models to new tasks from just a task description at test time, without updating model weights. This has shown promise in NLP via large language models, but enabling similar capabilities for computer vision models has been challenging. Two key issues need to be addressed - the model architecture should allow processing multimodal prompts for various vision tasks, and models need to be trained differently than standard supervised approaches to unlock emergent in-context learning abilities.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes IMProv, an inpainting-based model for multimodal prompting of vision models. The model is a masked autoencoder with a discrete VQGAN codebook that takes as input a text description and a visual grid prompt with example input-output pairs and a query image. During training, the model learns to inpaint randomly masked image regions conditioned on associated captions, without explicit task supervisions. At test time, the model can be prompted with text instructions, visual examples, or both, to solve novel vision tasks for a query image by inpainting the output in a grid prompt.

To facilitate multimodal prompting, the paper collects a new large-scale dataset (S2CV) of figures from CV papers and captions, along with extending an existing CV figures dataset with captions. The model is trained on S2CV, the captioned figures, and LAION-400M image-text pairs.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes IMProv, the first inpainting model for multimodal (text + image examples) prompting of vision models, to unlock in-context learning.
- Introduces concept of conditioning inpainting process on both images and text to reduce ambiguity.
- Demonstrates vision and language prompts are complementary for improved in-context performance.  
- Collects a new large-scale dataset (S2CV) to train the model.
- Achieves state-of-the-art in-context learning results on vision tasks like segmentation and colorization.
