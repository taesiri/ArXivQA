# [Natural Language Commanding via Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03460)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: How can we develop a natural language-friendly AI system to execute user intent across application features in productivity software like Microsoft Office?The key ideas and components to address this question seem to be:- Developing a domain-specific language (ODSL) that provides an abstraction layer between natural language and application APIs, allowing for separation of user intent understanding from execution.- Using large language models for program synthesis to translate natural language queries into executable ODSL programs.- An analysis-retrieval method to construct effective prompts for the LLMs by retrieving relevant examples and artifacts conditioned on the input query.- Automatic code correction techniques to improve robustness of the synthesized ODSL programs.- An evaluation procedure based on program equivalence analysis to evaluate different system variants.The overall hypothesis appears to be that by combining LLMs for understanding user intent with a domain-specific language for intent fulfillment, they can develop a natural language commanding system with improved robustness compared to using LLMs alone. The ablation study seems designed to validate the contributions of the different system components.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The design of the Office Domain Specific Language (ODSL), which is a high-level, LLM-friendly language specialized for performing actions and interacting with entities in Office applications like PowerPoint.2. The architecture of Semantic Interpreter, which leverages an analysis-retrieval prompt construction method with large language models to translate natural language user queries into executable ODSL programs.3. A procedure for evaluating natural language commanding systems that leverage program synthesis by reformulating it as program equivalence analysis. 4. An exploration focused on PowerPoint that demonstrates the potential of using program synthesis and ODSL to build natural language commanding experiences for productivity software.In summary, the key ideas are using program synthesis with a custom domain-specific language ODSL to enable natural language commanding of Office applications, and an analysis-retrieval prompt engineering method to make this approach robust and accurate. The evaluation procedure analyzes program equivalence rather than exact match to a single ground truth program. Overall, this work illustrates a promising approach to build AI systems that can understand and execute user intent across application features using natural language.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents Semantic Interpreter, an AI system that leverages large language models and a domain-specific language called ODSL to translate natural language commands into executable programs for manipulating content in Microsoft Office applications.
