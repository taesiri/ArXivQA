# [Natural Language Commanding via Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03460)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: How can we develop a natural language-friendly AI system to execute user intent across application features in productivity software like Microsoft Office?The key ideas and components to address this question seem to be:- Developing a domain-specific language (ODSL) that provides an abstraction layer between natural language and application APIs, allowing for separation of user intent understanding from execution.- Using large language models for program synthesis to translate natural language queries into executable ODSL programs.- An analysis-retrieval method to construct effective prompts for the LLMs by retrieving relevant examples and artifacts conditioned on the input query.- Automatic code correction techniques to improve robustness of the synthesized ODSL programs.- An evaluation procedure based on program equivalence analysis to evaluate different system variants.The overall hypothesis appears to be that by combining LLMs for understanding user intent with a domain-specific language for intent fulfillment, they can develop a natural language commanding system with improved robustness compared to using LLMs alone. The ablation study seems designed to validate the contributions of the different system components.
