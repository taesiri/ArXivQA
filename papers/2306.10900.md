# MotionGPT: Finetuned LLMs are General-Purpose Motion Generators

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper seems to be exploring a new framework for human motion generation that can leverage multiple control signals, including both text and poses, within a unified model. Specifically, the paper introduces MotionGPT, which is proposed as a novel method capable of generating human motions using multimodal control conditions like text descriptions and single-frame poses. The central hypothesis appears to be that large language models like LLMs can be adapted to serve as effective human motion generators through proper finetuning and instruction design. By quantizing pose conditions into discrete codes and creating composite instructions using both text and pose codes, MotionGPT aims to enable LLMs to generate suitable motion sequences in response.The experiments conducted on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets seem designed to validate the effectiveness of MotionGPT at motion generation under diverse control signals like text, initial poses, final poses, and random keyframe poses. The results help demonstrate that MotionGPT can achieve competitive performance to prior specialized models, while using far fewer training parameters.In summary, the key research focus is on introducing and validating MotionGPT as a novel framework that can unify text and pose based motion generation within a single model by leveraging the capabilities of large language models. The paper aims to show LLMs can be readily adapted for human motion generation when provided with properly constructed multimodal instructions.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents experiments on two motion-language datasets, HumanML3D and KIT-ML, evaluating the performance of a proposed model called MotionGPT for text-based motion generation under multiple control conditions including text, initial poses, last poses, and random keyframe poses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in human motion generation:- It explores a novel setting of generating motions from both text and human pose inputs, which most prior works have not studied. Existing methods like TEMOS, MotionDiffuse, etc. focus only on text-to-motion generation. - The idea of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for motion generation is quite new and unexplored. The authors demonstrate the potential of using pre-trained LLMs as a strong motion prior for generation. This is a distinctive approach compared to other works.- Most current methods train specialized networks for motion generation. This paper shows that an LLM can be readily tuned into a motion generator by only updating a small subset of parameters. The simplicity and efficiency of this approach contrasts previous work.- It presents a unified framework named MotionGPT that is able to handle diverse control modalities (text, pose) and different tasks using adjustable instructions. This generality is novel compared to prior single-task or single-modality models.- The experimental results demonstrate MotionGPT achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art techniques while requiring far fewer parameters and training time. This efficiency is a major advantage over other models.- One limitation is that MotionGPT currently may not scale well to even larger datasets and longer sequences due to the computational cost. Some recent works have shown promise in scaling up motion generation.In summary, the core novelty of this work lies in adapting LLMs for multimodal motion generation in an efficient and unified manner. The simplicity yet generality of MotionGPT offers a new direction that contrasts most existing specialized solutions. If the efficiency can scale up, it may become an advantageous approach over current methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving motion generation quality and generalization capability by augmenting the amount of motion data used for fine-tuning the model. They suggest combining large volumes of unlabeled motion capture data with existing annotated motion-text datasets to enhance MotionGPT's performance.- Extending MotionGPT to support a wider range of human-related tasks beyond just motion generation, such as skeleton-based action recognition and motion denoising. They suggest leveraging LLMs for a unified understanding across tasks related to human motion.- Reducing the inference cost and improving the inference speed of MotionGPT, which currently requires passing through the entire LLM to generate each motion clip. Optimizing this could enable better real-time performance.- Validating MotionGPT on a more diverse set of control modalities beyond just text and pose, such as music and audio features. This could expand its applicability to more real-world use cases.- Exploring different LLM architectures as the base model for MotionGPT to harness advancements in foundation model capabilities. The authors suggest stronger LLMs could substantially enhance MotionGPT's performance.- Studying the potential of using MotionGPT for more advanced applications like human-robot interaction and motion control. The authors suggest it could enable more intuitive robot programming leveraging multimodal human knowledge.In summary, the main suggested directions are around scaling up data, expanding supported tasks and modalities, optimizing inference, integrating latest LLMs, and exploring advanced applications like human-robot interaction. The authors see MotionGPT as an initial step toward more versatile and unified motion generation systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents MotionGPT, a novel method for generating human motions using multimodal control signals like text and single-frame poses. MotionGPT converts poses into discrete motion codes using a pre-trained VQ-VAE. It then generates instructions by combining codes from textual and pose prompts. An LLM is fine-tuned to generate pose sequences answering these instructions through a localized rewiring approach. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate MotionGPT's effectiveness in motion generation under diverse control signals, while only requiring a small fraction of LLM parameters to be tuned. The approach also enables adapting the framework to various generation tasks by modifying instructions. Overall, the paper introduces an efficient way to leverage LLM capabilities for multimodal controllable motion generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents MotionGPT, a novel method for generating human motions using multimodal control signals such as text and single-frame poses. MotionGPT treats human motions as specialized word tokens and enables diverse and realistic motion generation by simply fine-tuning a large language model (LLM). The core idea is to leverage the extensive knowledge about human motions embedded within LLMs that arises from their pre-training on massive text corpora. MotionGPT first maps human poses to discrete codes using a pretrained VQ-VAE. It then constructs a unified prompt combining these motion codes, text conditions, and task instructions. By answering these prompts, the LLM is finetuned using a localized rewiring approach to output target motion sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate MotionGPT's effectiveness in motion generation under varying control signals, including text, initial/last poses, and keyframe poses. The unified framework achieves competitive results compared to prior work while only finetuning a small fraction of LLM parameters. MotionGPT provides more practical and fine-grained control over motion generation, opening up new possibilities for multimodal synthesis.In summary, this paper introduces MotionGPT, a novel LLM-based method for controllable human motion generation using both text and poses. Leveraging LLMs allows MotionGPT to achieve strong results with minimal finetuning. The unified framework offers more practical control modalities compared to prior single-condition approaches. MotionGPT demonstrates the potential of using pretrained LLMs for multimodal motion synthesis tasks.
