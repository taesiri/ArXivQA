# [On Convergence of Adam for Stochastic Optimization under Relaxed   Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03982)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the convergence behavior of the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm for stochastic optimization. Specifically, it considers the challenges of analyzing vanilla Adam under a realistic noise model that allows for unbounded gradients and affine variance noise (where the variance scales with the gradient norm). Most prior work requires simplifying assumptions like bounded gradients or alterations to Adam. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors provide a comprehensive noise model that covers affine variance noise as well as bounded and sub-Gaussian noise. Under this model, they show that vanilla Adam can find a stationary point with high probability at a rate of O(poly(log T)/âˆšT), without the need to tune step-sizes based on problem parameters. This matches the lower convergence rate for stochastic first-order methods. 

Key Technical Contributions:
- Constructs a new proxy step-size sequence to break the correlation between gradients and adaptive step-sizes, enabling the analysis.  
- Introduces a localized gradient bound based on the iteration number that is used in the proxy step-size and high-probability convergence analysis.
- Provides a refined induction argument to bound gradient norms, handling the potential for unbounded gradients.  
- Extends the analysis to generalized smoothness conditions, still ensuring convergence but requiring step-size tuning based on problem parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is a comprehensive analysis of Adam under realistic noise and smoothness assumptions, proving convergence rates without parameter tuning and highlighting conditions where tuning may be unavoidable. The technical novelty lies in the proxy step-size approach and localized gradient bounding technique.
