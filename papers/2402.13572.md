# [On the Expressive Power of a Variant of the Looped Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers show great performance across NLP and other domains, but their mathematical understanding remains limited. Some works view them simply as function approximators, while others show they can learn algorithms from data.
- Existing looped transformers have limitations in representing complex algorithms efficiently.

Proposed Solution:  
- Authors propose a new transformer block called "AlgoFormer", with a structure inspired by human-designed algorithms:
   - Pre-transformer: preprocesses input data
   - Looped transformer: acts as an iterative optimization algorithm
   - Post-transformer: postprocesses to output desired results
- This structure mirrors steps in practical algorithms - data preprocessing, optimization solver, postprocessing.

Main Contributions:
- AlgoFormer has lower parameters but higher expressiveness than standard transformers in algorithm learning.
- It can represent algorithms more efficiently than vanilla looped transformers.  
- Theoretically show AlgoFormer can solve challenging tasks by implementing algorithms like gradient descent.
- AlgoFormer can realize more complex algorithms like Newton's method.
- Extend theoretical results to decoder-only transformers.
- Experiments validate AlgoFormer outperforms standard & vanilla looped transformers in algorithmic tasks.
- Analysis shows transformers could be "smarter" than some human-designed algorithms.

In summary, the authors design a structured AlgoFormer transformer to enhance its algorithm learning capabilities. Both theoretically and empirically, AlgoFormer demonstrates greater expressiveness and effectiveness than standard/looped transformers in representing algorithms to solve complex tasks. The work provides valuable insights into interpreting transformers as algorithm learners.
