# [InstructEdit: Instruction-based Knowledge Editing for Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16123)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on single-task settings and have limited ability to generalize across tasks. 
- When evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks unseen during training, performance declines significantly.
- This requires training one distinct editor for each task, which is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes InstructEdit, an instruction-based editing technique for LLMs that facilitates adaptation to various tasks using simple instructions. 
- InstructEdit utilizes meta-learning to train an editor on meticulously curated instructions across diverse tasks. 
- The key idea is that instructions can enhance the editor's comprehension and control to enable multi-task editing capabilities with one unified editor.

Main Contributions:
- Constructs premium quality instruction datasets for multi-task editing by generating tailored instructions for each task.
- Empirically demonstrates InstructEdit's ability to equip the editor for multi-task editing, enhancing reliability by 14.86% on average.
- Experiments show InstructEdit yields 42.04% improvement on unseen out-of-distribution test set compared to baselines.  
- Analysis provides insights, like instructions helping control optimization direction and more tasks leading to better generalization.

In summary, the paper introduces the problem of generalizing knowledge editing to new tasks, proposes an instruction-based editing approach to address it, and provides extensive experimental validation and analysis. The main impact is enabling one unified editor to handle multi-task editing with improved efficiency.
