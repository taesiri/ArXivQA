# [Multi-Object RANSAC: Efficient Plane Clustering Method in a Clutter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Plane clustering in cluttered environments with objects of varying scales is challenging for robotic perception and manipulation. Existing plane clustering methods target large indoor structures and fail to segment objects properly in cluttered scenes. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Multi-Object RANSAC (MO-RANSAC), a novel plane clustering method specialized for cluttered environments. It consists of two main components:
  1) Deep Plane Clustering (DPC) module: Uses a backbone network and voting layers to cluster points into subplanes based on geometric features. Trained via self-supervision using RANSAC pseudo-labels.
  2) Post-processing: Refines subplane clusters from DPC by merging ones belonging to the same plane.

- Key ideas: 
  - Leverage neural networks and voting layers to effectively cluster planes amidst clutter.
  - Use RANSAC in a self-supervised manner to train DPC module.
  - Refine subplane clusters after initial deep clustering stage.

Contributions:
- Proposes MO-RANSAC, a specialized plane clustering technique for cluttered scenes with objects of vastly different scales.
- Introduces Deep Plane Clustering module trained in a self-supervised manner using RANSAC pseudo-labels.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art plane instance segmentation performance on benchmark datasets.
- Shows improved robotic suction grasping using MO-RANSAC over other plane clustering and grasping methods.

In summary, the paper puts forth an efficient neural network based approach for plane clustering in cluttered environments and shows its usefulness for robotic manipulation tasks through extensive experiments. The self-supervised training strategy and post-processing refinement make it adaptable to various complex scenes.
