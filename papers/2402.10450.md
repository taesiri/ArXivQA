# [PRISE: Learning Temporal Action Abstractions as a Sequence Compression   Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10450)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning useful temporal action abstractions (i.e. reusable, variable-timespan skills) from offline datasets can enable more efficient policy learning in continuous control tasks involving complex, high-dimensional observations and actions. However, discovering such skills automatically remains challenging.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new method called Primitive Sequence Encoding (PRISE) that formulates skill discovery as a sequence compression problem. It brings in techniques from natural language processing (NLP), specifically byte pair encoding (BPE) which is used for tokenization in large language models. 

The key ideas are:
(1) Learn a module to discretize/quantize the continuous action space into discrete codes. 
(2) Convert demonstration trajectories into sequences of these discrete codes.
(3) Apply BPE on the code sequences to identify commonly reoccurring patterns as skills. BPE starts with the codes and iteratively merges frequent pairs into new tokens.

This results in a vocabulary of reusable, variable-timespan skill tokens that capture common motion patterns across tasks. These skills can be used to learn policies more efficiently.

Contributions:
(1) Novel connection between skill discovery in control and sequence compression techniques from NLP. BPE is adapted to induce temporal abstractions.
(2) Empirically shown that policies learned using PRISE skills significantly outperform baselines on multi-task imitation learning and few-shot adaptation experiments.
(3) Extensive analysis provided to study the effects of different components and hyperparameters.

In summary, the paper introduces a new perspective to temporal skill discovery by framing it as a sequence compression problem and shows promising results on challenging vision-based manipulation benchmarks.
