# [An Empirical study of Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation: analyzing   NMT output, model's behavior and sentences' contribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12588)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) aims to develop high-quality translation models without relying on expensive human-translated parallel texts. However, there has been little analysis on model behavior and output quality beyond translation accuracy. 

Methodology
- The authors train English-French, English-Gujarati and English-Kazakh translation models with varying levels of supervision - unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised.
- They analyze model output across training stages for quality (BLEU), word order (Fuzzy Reordering Score, Translation Edit Rate), sentence contributions to translations (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation), robustness and consistency against input perturbations.

Key Findings
- Confirm existence of previously identified training stages in supervised NMT also hold for unsupervised and semi-supervised models. 
- Unsupervised methods generate more monotonic outputs compared to source sentences but are more semantically distant from references.  
- Backtranslation boosts influence of source sentences, especially in low-resource scenarios.
- Unsupervised models demonstrate higher robustness to perturbations and ability to recover from errors.
- Source sentence reliance is higher in limited training data regimes.

Main Contributions  
- First analysis highlighting UNMT advantages over supervised NMT beyond translation accuracy.
- Evaluation of model internal behavior and output characteristics for UNMT using diverse languages.
- Demonstration of source sentence influence and model robustness for UNMT models.
- Confirmation of consistent training stages across NMT paradigms.

The analysis provides significant insights into model behavior, while also evaluating quality aspects beyond precision for UNMT.
