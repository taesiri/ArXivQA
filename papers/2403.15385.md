# [LATTE3D: Large-scale Amortized Text-To-Enhanced3D Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15385)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent text-to-3D generation methods can produce impressive 3D models from text prompts, but often require expensive per-prompt optimization that takes up to an hour per sample. Methods like ATT3D optimize prompts simultaneously with a shared model to improve efficiency, but they struggle with scale, detail, and generalization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces LATTE3D, a new amortized text-to-enhanced-3D architecture, to achieve fast and high-quality generation from text prompts. Key ideas:

1) Scalable amortized optimization architecture that can handle orders of magnitude more prompts than prior methods. Trains on 101k prompts.

2) Incorporates 3D knowledge to improve quality and robustness, using 3D-aware diffusion priors, shape regularization losses, and pretraining for 3D reconstruction.

3) Amortizes both volumetric and surface-based stages to output textured meshes in one forward pass, capturing high-frequency details.  

4) Generates shapes in 400ms per prompt. Allows lightweight test-time optimization.

5) Can adapt the method for text-controlled 3D stylization by training on shape-prompt pairs.

Main Contributions:

- New amortized architecture that scales to 100k prompts with high visual quality
- Incorporation of 3D data via losses and pretraining to improve robustness 
- Amortization of both volumetric field and textured mesh generation
- 400ms interactive generation time, optional test-time tuning
- Application to text-controlled 3D stylization

The method achieves strong qualitative and quantitative results compared to optimization baselines. It represents an advance in scale, speed and quality for amortized text-to-3D generation.
