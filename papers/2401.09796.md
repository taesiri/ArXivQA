# [A Fast, Performant, Secure Distributed Training Framework For Large   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Distributed training of large language models (LLMs) using federated learning is important to leverage siloed domain-specific data. However, it faces security threats of parameters or data being stolen by malicious clients or servers.

Proposed Solution:
- A secure distributed LLM framework based on model slicing using trusted execution environments (TEEs) like Intel SGX and TDX on both client and server side. 

- Method 1: Small memory TEE on client side secures sensitive model parts like LoRA parameters or P-tuning embeddings. Lightweight encryption used for secure transmission. TEE on server aggregates gradients securely.

- Method 2: LLM split into two parts across layers. First part on client, second part on server's TEE. Clients generate embeddings on first part which are uploaded to server's TEE after encryption. Server fine-tunes second part using proposed Sparsification Parameter Fine-tuning (SPF).

Main Contributions:
- A secure distributed training framework for LLMs using model slicing and TEEs to prevent both client and server side threats.

- Two solutions catering to consumer-grade small memory TEEs and industrial-grade large memory TEEs balancing cost, security and accuracy.

- A new Sparsification Parameter Fine-tuning technique to selectively fine-tune important parameters improving accuracy with fewer overall parameters.

- Experiments validate high efficiency, security and accuracy of proposed techniques compared to baseline federated learning.

In summary, the paper proposes novel techniques to enable secure distributed training of LLMs, providing flexibility to balance cost, security needs and accuracy goals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a secure distributed language model training framework using model slicing, trusted execution environments, and lightweight encryption to prevent parameter and data leakage on both the server and client side while maintaining model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a secure distributed training framework for large language models (LLMs) to prevent leakage of model parameters and data on both the server side and client side. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes two methods to slice the LLM and deploy sensitive parts of the model structure inside trusted execution environments (TEEs) on the server and/or clients. Lightweight encryption using one-time pads is used to protect transmission between TEEs and GPUs.

2) Method 1 uses small-memory consumer-grade TEEs (Intel SGX) while Method 2 utilizes large-memory industrial-grade TEEs (Intel TDX). Users can choose between the two methods based on their cost and resource considerations. 

3) The paper also proposes a split fine-tuning scheme in Method 2, where the LLM is split into two parts. The first part is frozen while the second part is fine-tuned using a sparsification scheme that freezes subsets of parameters. This improves efficiency and accuracy.

4) Experiments show the proposed methods can provide security guarantees with minimal impact on accuracy compared to plain federated learning, while balancing cost and efficiency tradeoffs.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a secure and performant distributed training framework for LLMs that protects against leakage of sensitive model and data information.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two methods (Method1 and Method2) for secure distributed training of large language models. What are the key differences between these two methods in terms of system architecture and threat model assumptions? 

2. In Method1, the authors use a consumer-grade TEE (Intel SGX) which has limited memory. How does this impact the model partitioning strategy and what encryption schemes can be supported within the constraints of SGX?

3. The paper utilizes one-time pads (OTPs) for lightweight encryption of features between the TEE and GPU. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using OTPs? Why can OTPs only support linear operations efficiently?

4. In Method2, the authors propose a novel split fine-tuning approach where only certain heads of the self-attention layers are fine-tuned based on their L1 norms. What is the intuition behind this sparsification scheme? How does it compare to other structured pruning techniques?

5. For the QKV linear and dense linear layers in Method2, different fine-tuning ratios (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 62.5%, 100%) are experimented with. What trends do you observe regarding model accuracy, latency, and number of parameters from Table 2? How would you determine the optimal ratios?

6. The paper claims higher accuracy for Method2 over Method1. But from Table 1, the gains seem moderate other than for 1-2 datasets. What could explain this? Is there a way to further improve the accuracy of Method2?

7. Both methods only communicate model updates in encrypted form. What are the privacy implications if the model updates themselves were to leak? Could differential privacy or other techniques help?

8. The threat model in this work focuses on malicious attacks to steal model parameters or training data. What other threat models should be considered for secure federated learning of large language models?

9. Deploying TEEs incurs significant computational overheads as shown in Table 3. What hardware or software optimizations could help improve the efficiency while retaining security guarantees?

10. The proposed approach relies on deploying TEEs on both clients and servers which may limit adoption. Can you conceive of other system designs that provide security without needing expensive secure hardware everywhere?
