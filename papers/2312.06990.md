## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an AI-based Wildfire Prevention, Detection and Suppression System (WPDSS) to address the growing threat of destructive wildfires worldwide. WPDSS is an end-to-end solution that uses satellite data and machine learning algorithms to predict wildfire hotspots, detect active wildfires, and autonomously deploy drones to spray fire retardant to prevent and suppress fires. The system attains 98.6% and 98.7% accuracy in identifying hotspots and active fires respectively using a randomized forest classifier trained on labeled data. Once a hotspot or wildfire is identified, the location coordinates are sent to a drone that can spray up to 10 acres per hour with a 10kg payload of retardant. Analysis shows one to two drones are needed to cover a typical hotspot area. The system has the potential to significantly reduce the impacts of wildfires on ecosystems, economies, and human health and safety. By preventing ignition and spreading, WPDSS can help mitigate climate change impacts from carbon dioxide release. The authors suggest future work to integrate more environmentally friendly and rapid deployment drone technologies.
