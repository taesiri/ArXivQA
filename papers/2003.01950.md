# [AlignTTS: Efficient Feed-Forward Text-to-Speech System without Explicit   Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01950)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the speed and performance of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis systems using a non-autoregressive feed-forward architecture. 

Specifically, the key points are:

- Proposing AlignTTS, a feed-forward network to generate mel-spectrograms in parallel for fast TTS.

- Using a duration predictor to align text to mel-spectrograms instead of attention mechanism. 

- Introducing an alignment loss to precisely learn text-to-mel alignments during training.

- Achieving state-of-the-art performance while being over 50x faster than real-time TTS on LJSpeech dataset.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that using a feed-forward Transformer combined with explicit alignment modeling can achieve both high-quality and very fast parallel TTS compared to autoregressive methods like Tacotron. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.
