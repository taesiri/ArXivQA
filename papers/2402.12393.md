# [On Automating Video Game Testing by Planning and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "On Automating Video Game Testing by Planning and Learning":

Problem:
- Game testing is a complex but vital part of video game development. It involves testing diverse scenarios, UI/playability, stability, efficiency etc. Currently automation of testing methods has ample room for improvement, especially techniques that do not significantly alter developer workflow.  

- Planning is an underutilized tool for game testing. Two key difficulties are: 1) the authorial burden of writing good PDDL domain and problem descriptions, 2) efficient use of rare PDDL modeling experts by improving their productivity.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a workflow to help game developers use planners to generate PDDL-driven test scripts. This involves:
  1) Augmenting game logs for action model capture
  2) Applying action model learning (AML) to logs to automatically create PDDL models
  3) Manual validation/adjustment of models by PDDL experts 
  4) Using planners and goal templates to formulate test planning problems

- The workflow enables cooperation between developers without PDDL expertise and PDDL experts without game dev expertise.

Main Contributions:
- Definition of a general workflow for synthesizing PDDL models from game logs to leverage planning for automated game testing
- Demonstration of the workflow on a simple RPG game built using the Unity game engine
- Identification and discussion of multiple challenges related to further automation of logging and learning

The paper presents an initial step towards minimizing or eliminating the need for a PDDL modeling expert in the workflow, with the goal of making automated planning more accessible.
