# [On Automating Video Game Testing by Planning and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "On Automating Video Game Testing by Planning and Learning":

Problem:
- Game testing is a complex but vital part of video game development. It involves testing diverse scenarios, UI/playability, stability, efficiency etc. Currently automation of testing methods has ample room for improvement, especially techniques that do not significantly alter developer workflow.  

- Planning is an underutilized tool for game testing. Two key difficulties are: 1) the authorial burden of writing good PDDL domain and problem descriptions, 2) efficient use of rare PDDL modeling experts by improving their productivity.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a workflow to help game developers use planners to generate PDDL-driven test scripts. This involves:
  1) Augmenting game logs for action model capture
  2) Applying action model learning (AML) to logs to automatically create PDDL models
  3) Manual validation/adjustment of models by PDDL experts 
  4) Using planners and goal templates to formulate test planning problems

- The workflow enables cooperation between developers without PDDL expertise and PDDL experts without game dev expertise.

Main Contributions:
- Definition of a general workflow for synthesizing PDDL models from game logs to leverage planning for automated game testing
- Demonstration of the workflow on a simple RPG game built using the Unity game engine
- Identification and discussion of multiple challenges related to further automation of logging and learning

The paper presents an initial step towards minimizing or eliminating the need for a PDDL modeling expert in the workflow, with the goal of making automated planning more accessible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a workflow for automating video game testing by generating detailed gameplay logs, applying action model learning to obtain a PDDL model, formulating domain problems of interest for testing, and executing the resulting test scripts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method and workflow for automating the testing of certain video game aspects using automated planning and planning action model learning techniques. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a workflow that enables cooperation between game developers and planning experts to acquire a PDDL model representing the game's rules. This model can then be used for automated game testing.

- The workflow involves developers providing an informal structured description of game actions, implementing logging of necessary predicates, learning an initial PDDL model from logs, refinements by a planning expert, and verification using automatically generated plans/test scripts.

- The paper demonstrates this workflow on a simple RPG game example built in Unity, showing the process end-to-end.

- The paper also discusses challenges and future work related to further automating steps in the workflow, especially related to automated logging and mapping code functions to planning actions.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed method and workflow for leveraging planning and learning to automate certain aspects of game testing, demonstrated on a concrete example.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Automated planning
- Planning action model learning
- PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)
- Video game testing
- Game logs
- Workflow automation
- Action model synthesis
- Goal templates
- Test script generation
- Unity game engine

The paper proposes a workflow to leverage automated planning and planning action model learning techniques to help automate certain aspects of video game testing. It focuses on generating detailed gameplay logs, applying action model learning to obtain a PDDL model, and then using that model along with goal templates to automatically generate test scripts. A proof-of-concept demonstration is provided using a simple RPG game built with the Unity engine. Challenges and future work around further automating parts of the workflow are also discussed. So the core focus is on applying AI planning methods to aid video game testing automation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the level of abstraction for modeling the game rules cannot be too high, otherwise the learned domain would only generate nonspecific test scenarios. What are some strategies the authors could explore to determine the optimal level of abstraction that balances complexity and usefulness of the learned models?

2. The paper discusses challenges with automatically mapping game code functions to planning actions due to limitations of the STRIPS representation. What extensions to the planning language could help mitigate this issue and allow more complex game code functions to map to planning actions? 

3. The workflow relies on a clean handoff of information between the game developer and planning expert. What are some ways this communication could break down and how might the process be adapted to make it more robust?

4. The proof-of-concept example uses a simple grid abstraction for locations. In more complex games, what other types of location abstractions could be used instead to balance accuracy and complexity?

5. The paper mentions using planning to find gameplay dead-ends. What are some algorithms or search strategies that could be used to efficiently identify these states? How could the information then be presented back to the developer?

6. For more complex games, scalability of planning and learning may become an issue. What are some ways the workflow could be adapted to work on large-scale commercial games? 

7. The proof-of-concept focuses only on controllable game elements. How could the method account for stochasticity and uncontrolled events driven by physics, AI, etc?

8. The paper proposes automated testing of generated plans, but debugging failed tests could be challenging. What kind of information would need to be logged and presented to the developer to efficiently debug plan failures?

9. What safety considerations need to be made when using automated planning to generate a wide array of test cases? Could generated tests ever damage the integrity of a game state?

10. The paper focuses on testing, but how could automated planning analysis additionally be used to balance gameplay, prevent exploits/shortcuts, and improve the player experience?
