# [Prior Constraints-based Reward Model Training for Aligning Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This involves training a reward model on preference data using ranking loss. 
- However, the training procedure suffers from uncontrolled scaling of reward scores during RL due to lacking constraints while training the reward model. This can cause the reward model to predict scores with unnecessarily large margins.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Prior Constraints-based Reward Model (PCRM) training method to mitigate this problem. 
- PCRM incorporates prior constraints - specifically length ratio and cosine similarity between outputs - during reward model training. This regulates the optimization magnitude and controls score margins.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes PCRM method that adds constraints based on length ratio and cosine similarity when training the reward model. This prevents uncontrolled scaling of predicted reward scores.
- Comprehensively evaluates PCRM by testing rank correlation with human preferences and effectiveness for aligning LLMs. Results show PCRM significantly improves alignment performance.
- Demonstrates PCRM can be integrated into other rank-based alignment methods like direct preference optimization and yield consistent improvements.
- Provides analysis of PCRM including impact of constraint values and compares optimization process to vanilla ranking loss.

In summary, the key innovation is the proposed PCRM method that regulates reward model training through prior constraints. This enables better alignment of LLMs to human preferences compared to conventional RLHF approaches. The constraints prevent uncontrolled scaling of scores while retaining accuracy.
