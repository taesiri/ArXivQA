# [MP2D: An Automated Topic Shift Dialogue Generation Framework Leveraging   Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Managing topic shifts within dialogues is a key challenge for conversational systems, but limited training data availability hinders progress. 
- Existing topic shift dialogue datasets require laborious human annotation.
- There is a need for an automated way to generate high-quality dialogues with natural topic transitions.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose Multi-Passage to Dialogue (MP2D), an automated framework to generate conversational question answering datasets with topic shifts.
- MP2D leverages relationships between entities in a knowledge graph to map dialogue flow and retrieve relevant passages as the dialog progresses.
- It transforms passages into QA pairs using the Passage-to-Dialogue method, with LLMs generating questions.
- Additional instructions at topic boundaries guide LLM question generation.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to automatically generate topic shift dialogues, addressing data scarcity.
- Experiments show MP2D produces high quality dialogues both automatically (reference-free metrics) and manually (crowdworker/GPT-4 evaluation).
- A novel benchmark, TS-WikiDialog, enables model evaluation on topic shift tasks. Models trained on MP2D data outperform baselines.
- Analysis shows even large models struggle with topic shifts. MP2D data helps improve their performance.

In summary, MP2D is an impactful automated framework to create topic shift dialogues by leveraging knowledge graphs, helping advance dialogue systems' capability to handle topic transitions. Both automatic and human evaluations confirm the efficacy of MP2D.
