## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 After carefully reading the paper, it seems the central research question is:

What can we learn from existing datasets that contain human-annotated textual explanations, and what recommendations can we provide for collecting high-quality explainable NLP datasets in the future? 

The authors review and summarize the literature on collecting textual explanations for explainable NLP. They identify three main types of textual explanations that have been collected in datasets: highlights, free-text, and structured. The paper analyzes strengths and shortcomings of existing data collection methodologies for each explanation type. It highlights important considerations from the interplay between data collection, modeling, and evaluation assumptions. The authors provide recommendations for future data collection based on what has been learned so far in this emerging research area. The overarching goal is to promote better practices and standardization when creating new textual explanation datasets for explainable NLP.

- The paper surveys and categorizes 65 existing ExNLP datasets into three main types: highlights, free-text explanations, and structured explanations. It provides an overview of each dataset and how the explanations were collected.

- It highlights and discusses important lessons learned from analyzing existing ExNLP data collection methodologies. In particular, it focuses on two main case studies: (1) issues with using human-annotated highlights for evaluating model-generated highlights, and (2) the emergence of structured explanations as an alternative to purely free-text explanations. 

- It synthesizes best practices and gives recommendations for future ExNLP dataset construction. This includes suggestions for ensuring data quality, increasing diversity, embracing natural structure in explanations, and the importance of documenting data collection details and constraints.

Overall, the main contribution is a thorough literature review of ExNLP datasets coupled with an insightful critical analysis and synthesis of recommendations for the research community. The paper helps standardize practices around ExNLP dataset creation and highlights important considerations for using existing datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper reviews existing datasets for explainable NLP, categorizes them into three types (highlights, free-text, and structured), analyzes their collection methodologies, and provides recommendations for future dataset creation based on lessons learned.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on explainable natural language processing (ExNLP) datasets:

- Scope - This paper provides a broad review of 65 datasets with textual explanations, categorizing them into highlights, free-text, and structured explanations. Other surveys tend to focus on a specific explanation type or application area. For example, some reviews cover just free-text rationales or visual explanations. This paper aims to synthesize findings across different explanation formats.

- Critical analysis - The authors provide a more critical analysis of ExNLP dataset creation compared to other surveys. They highlight potential issues like insufficient or non-comprehensive highlights, lack of annotation diversity leading to artifacts, and over-constraining free-text explanations. Other reviews tend to just summarize datasets without as much discussion of limitations.

- Recommendations - A key contribution is the set of recommendations for creating higher quality ExNLP datasets. These cover best practices like using a "collect-and-edit" approach, assessing task explainability, and embracing natural structure in explanations. Other surveys focus less on guidelines for future data collection.

- Up-to-date - At 65 datasets, this is one of the most comprehensive reviews to date. The authors cover very recent datasets and preprints through 2021. Other surveys cover fewer or older datasets since this is a rapidly expanding field.

In summary, this review provides a uniquely broad, critical, and up-to-date analysis of ExNLP datasets compared to other literature surveys. The actionable recommendations for improving dataset creation are a notable addition not found in most reviews.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Studying how to best define and utilize the second class of "explaining observed events or phenomena" datasets (discussed in Section 3 and Appendix A). The authors suggest these datasets currently do not directly serve the three main goals of ExNLP, but could potentially be useful in the future.

- Exploring contrastive and negative explanations more thoroughly (Section 6.3), such as by collecting contrastive free-text or structured explanations. The authors believe these types of explanations could help train more robust and better-explaining models.

- Developing methods to automatically measure meaning overlap between explanations, which is needed to quantify diversity (Section 6.4). The authors suggest drawing from fundamental NLP research.

- Studying the quality-quantity tradeoff in automatic explanation collection methods (Section 5.1). The authors believe this is an important direction for future work.

- Exploring other potential necessary properties of human explanations besides those discussed in the paper (end of Appendix A). The authors focus on properties most relevant to current ExNLP research but acknowledge others may exist.

- Continuing to critically evaluate explanation collection methodologies to promote standardization and reveal implications for downstream uses (throughout). The authors call for explanation datasets and their constraints to be thoroughly documented.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: better defining the emerging second class of ExNLP datasets, collecting new annotation types like contrastive explanations, developing methods to quantify explanation diversity, studying the quality-quantity tradeoff, identifying other key properties of human explanations, and continued critical evaluation of explanation collection practices.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper reviews datasets for explainable natural language processing (ExNLP) that contain human-annotated textual explanations. It summarizes 65 existing ExNLP datasets into three main types: highlights, free-text explanations, and structured explanations. The paper analyzes the strengths and shortcomings of different data collection methodologies used for these datasets. Two key points are highlighted - first, that common methods for collecting highlight explanations can result in datasets that are insufficient or non-comprehensive, causing issues for model training and evaluation. Second, that while some researchers discard template-like free-text explanations as low quality, embracing structure in explanations can be useful when it naturally arises from a task. The paper also provides recommendations for creating higher quality ExNLP datasets in the future, such as using a "collect-and-edit" approach and increasing diversity of explanations. Overall, the paper aims to promote discussion and standardization around ExNLP dataset development.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper provides a review of existing datasets for explainable natural language processing (ExNLP) research. The authors identify and organize 65 existing datasets into three main types: those with highlight, free-text, or structured explanations. They analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different data collection methodologies that have been used. The key points made are:

Paragraph 1) For highlight explanations, the authors find that existing human annotations are not necessarily sufficient nor comprehensive for evaluating model-generated highlights. They recommend avoiding highlights with low sufficiency, collecting comprehensive highlights to evaluate faithfulness, and carefully reporting collection details like instructions given to annotators. They warn researchers to avoid making assumptions about properties like comprehensiveness based on general dataset descriptions. 

Paragraph 2) For free-text explanations, the authors use a case study of two datasets to show that not all template-like explanations are undesirable, and structured explanations should be embraced when appropriate for a task. The authors give recommendations to improve free-text explanation quality, like teaching the task, addressing ambiguity, using a collect-and-edit approach, recruiting diverse annotators, and collecting contrastive or negative explanations. They synthesize recommendations from related work to further increase diversity and reduce artifacts.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a review of datasets for explainable natural language processing (ExNLP). The authors first define key terminology related to ExNLP, such as highlights, free-text explanations, and structured explanations. They then provide an overview of 65 existing ExNLP datasets, categorizing them based on the type of textual explanation they contain - highlights, free-text, or structured. The datasets are summarized in tables detailing the task, type of explanation, collection method, number of instances, etc. 

The authors then analyze what can be learned from the various dataset collection methodologies. They focus on two important points - the traditional process of collecting highlight explanations and its discrepancies with evaluating highlight models, and the emergence of structured explanations. They argue that assumptions made during data collection influence downstream uses of the datasets. The authors also discuss strategies to increase explanation quality and diversity. Overall, the main method is a comprehensive literature review categorized into highlight, free-text, and structured explanation datasets, along with a critical analysis of collection methodologies and recommendations for future work.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is reviewing datasets that contain human-annotated textual explanations for machine learning models. These explanations are used to train more interpretable models and evaluate how well models can generate explanations. The key questions and goals of the paper are:

- To categorize and summarize existing datasets with textual explanations (highlights, free-text, and structured).

- To analyze the strengths and shortcomings of different data collection methodologies used for these explanation datasets. 

- To provide recommendations for collecting high-quality explanation datasets in the future.

The paper argues that dataset collection is an under-scrutinized aspect of machine learning research. By critically examining explanation dataset construction, the authors aim to highlight best practices, standardize procedures, and avoid common pitfalls. The paper focuses specifically on textual explanations as they are predominant across tasks and modalities. It provides an in-depth analysis of how data collection decisions influence downstream modeling and evaluation of interpretable systems.

In summary, the key focus is on reviewing and synthesizing prior work on collecting textual explanation datasets, in order to guide and improve future research in interpretable and explainable AI.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper presents a review of datasets for explainable natural language processing (ExNLP). It identifies three main types of textual explanations collected in these datasets - highlights, free-text, and structured explanations - and provides examples of each. 65 existing ExNLP datasets containing these explanation types are surveyed, with a focus on the data collection methodologies used. Several key observations are made about current practices: 1) assumptions made during data collection influence downstream modeling, e.g. requiring self-contained free-text explanations promotes certain model architectures; 2) evaluating model-generated highlights revealed issues with human-authored highlights, like lack of comprehensiveness; 3) not all template-like explanations are low quality. Recommendations are provided to mitigate these issues in future data collection: 1) use a two-stage collect-and-edit approach to increase quality; 2) embrace structure inherent to explanations for a task; 3) comprehensively document collection assumptions and decisions; 4) increase diversity of explanations and annotators. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive review of the emerging ExNLP subfield and offers constructive feedback to improve data collection practices.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper reviews datasets for explainable natural language processing (ExNLP) by categorizing them into three types: highlights, free-text explanations, and structured explanations. It surveys 65 existing ExNLP datasets, analyzing their collection methodologies and properties. The authors discuss issues with current practices of collecting highlights and free-text explanations, such as not reporting annotation instructions precisely, collecting non-comprehensive highlights, and discarding template-like free-text explanations. They argue that assumptions made during data collection can influence downstream modeling decisions, and caution against making these assumptions universal constraints. The authors recommend collecting explanations in two stages to control quality, embracing structure in explanations when appropriate rather than avoiding it, and collecting contrastive and negative explanations beyond just explanations for the gold label. They synthesize best practices from related work to mitigate artifacts and increase diversity. The paper serves as a starting point for discussion on collecting high-quality ExNLP datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage data collection process involving first collecting candidate explanations automatically or from crowdworkers, and then having other crowdworkers assess, edit, and refine the quality of the explanations. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this two-stage collection process compared to just having crowdworkers write explanations from scratch?

2. When collecting free-text explanations, the authors recommend first studying how people naturally explain the task and embracing any inherent structure in the explanations. What are some ways to run pilot studies to understand how people naturally explain a task before full-scale data collection?

3. The authors recommend collecting multiple explanations per instance when there is subjectivity in the task or diversity of correct explanations. What are some analysis techniques or metrics that could be used to quantify the subjectivity of a task and determine if multiple explanations are warranted?

4. For highlight explanations, the authors distinguish between sufficient, comprehensive, and non-comprehensive highlights. How might the data collection instructions and resulting dataset quality differ depending on whether sufficiency, comprehensiveness, or both are required of the highlights? 

5. When is it appropriate to filter out template-like explanations during data collection? What analysis could be done on the template explanations before filtering to see if they provide any signal?

6. The paper recommends collecting contrastive or negative explanations. What are some creative ways contrastive explanations could be collected, beyond simple textual edits of the input? How could negative explanations be generated during data collection?

7. What are some analysis techniques that could be used after data collection to quantify the diversity of explanations collected? If diversity is found lacking, how should this inform future data collection?

8. For complex tasks, the authors recommend teaching and testing understanding of the task itself during data collection. What are some ways this training could be built into the data collection interface or process?

9. The authors recommend adding ambiguity options for cases where annotators are unsure of the label being explained. How might these ambiguity options impact analysis of the collected explanations and their utility for training models?

10. The authors call for better documentation of data collection procedures and constraints. What are some key details about the data collection process that should be documented to aid future data collectors and consumers?
