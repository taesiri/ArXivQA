# [Once for Both: Single Stage of Importance and Sparsity Search for Vision   Transformer Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15835)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing vision transformer compression (VTC) methods follow a two-stage scheme - first evaluating the importance score of each model unit and then searching for the optimal sparsity based on that importance distribution. This separate evaluation process causes a gap between the continuous importance distribution and discrete sparsity distribution, leading to suboptimal search performance and efficiency. 

Solution: 
This paper proposes a one-stage VTC approach called "Once for Both" (OFB) that simultaneously evaluates both importance and sparsity scores in an entangled manner to determine each unit's prunability. 

Key ideas:

1) A bi-mask scheme is developed that entangles an importance score (learned via a soft mask) and a differentiable sparsity score (relaxed from architecture parameters) to jointly assess each unit's pruning potential.

2) An adaptive one-hot loss function is designed to convert the continuous bi-mask score into a discrete 0/1 pruning choice while satisfying the sparsity constraint. This realizes a progressive and efficient search for the compact subnet.  

3) A Progressive Masked Image Modeling (PMIM) technique that gradually increases the masking ratio is proposed. This progressively intensifies the feature space regularization as dimensions reduce during pruning to maintain representation ability.

Main Results:

- State-of-the-art compression performance over previous transformer architecture search and pruning methods under various vision transformers, while significantly improving search efficiency (e.g. 1 GPU day to compress DeiT-S on ImageNet).

- Detailed ablation studies validate the contribution of each component and the effectiveness of simultaneously optimizing the entangled importance and sparsity scores.

- Visualizations of the bi-mask optimization process demonstrate that importance scores guide the initial search stage before sparsity scores take over to determine pruning choices.

To summarize, the key novelty is the one-stage evaluation and search scheme enabled by the proposed bi-mask optimization strategy. This efficiently searches for optimally compact vision transformers while outperforming existing two-stage methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel one-stage transformer pruning approach called Once for Both (OFB) that simultaneously evaluates importance and sparsity scores in a entangled manner to efficiently search for optimal vision transformer architectures under resource constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing a one-stage search paradigm called "Once for Both" (OFB) to simultaneously learn the importance and sparsity scores for Vision Transformer compression. Specifically:

1) It develops a bi-mask weight-sharing scheme and adaptive one-hot loss function to entangle the importance and sparsity scores, enabling the joint assessment of each unit's prunability in a single search stage. 

2) It proposes Progressive Masked Image Modeling (PMIM) to progressively regularize the dimension-reduced feature space during searching, maintaining representation learning ability.

3) Extensive experiments show OFB can achieve superior compression performance over state-of-the-art searching-based and pruning-based Vision Transformer compression methods, with significantly improved search efficiency. For example, it only costs one GPU day to compress DeiT-S on ImageNet.

In summary, the key innovation is exploring the entanglement of importance and sparsity distributions for efficient one-stage Vision Transformer compression. This effectively bridges the gap between continuous importance distribution and discrete sparsity distribution for enhanced search capability.

The paper proposes a new method called "Once for Both" (OFB) for efficiently compressing Vision Transformers. The key ideas include simultaneously evaluating the importance and sparsity of model units using a bi-mask scheme, optimizing this with an adaptive loss function, and regularizing the features during compression with PMIM. This allows transforming compression into a single-stage search problem rather than the typical two-stage approach. The method entangles importance and sparsity distributions, allowing more effective discretization and search. Experiments show OFB can compress Vision Transformers very efficiently while maintaining accuracy.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to entangle the importance and sparsity distributions into a single bi-mask score. What is the motivation behind this? How does it help bridge the gap between importance and sparsity distributions compared to prior two-stage schemes?

2. The bi-mask scheme contains an importance score and a sparsity score. Explain the meaning and computation process of each score. Why is the importance score normalized between 0 and 1 while the sparsity score is a probability? 

3. The paper introduces a time-varying weight coefficient Î»(t) when computing the bi-mask score. Analyze the effect of this coefficient on balancing the optimization focus between the importance and sparsity scores over time.  

4. The adaptive one-hot loss contains an entropy term and a variance term for regularizing the sparsity score. Provide theoretical analysis on why these two terms can drive the sparsity score distribution towards a one-hot vector.

5. Compare and contrast the effects of the entropy and variance regularizations on optimizing the sparsity score. What are their respective strengths and weaknesses? Why is employing both together more effective?

6. Explain why the variance regularization term needs to be activated by the tangent function. What is the effect of this activation on the variance regularization strength and optimization direction during searching?

7. The progressive masked image modeling (PMIM) technique is proposed to maintain representation learning of the progressively pruned model during search. Explain how PMIM works and why a progressive masking strategy is more suitable than a fixed masking ratio.  

8. Analyze the differences between the proposed bi-mask search scheme and the ordinal importance score encoding method used in prior Transformer Architecture Search works. What causes the superiority of the bi-mask scheme?

9. The method claims to reduce the reliance on inductive biases by randomly initializing the architecture parameters. Verify this claim through ablation studies and explain the negative impacts of inductive biases.  

10. How does the proposed simultaneous optimization of importance and sparsity in a single stage reduce the gap between the continuous importance distribution and discrete sparsity distribution compared to prior works? Explain its advantage in search efficiency.
