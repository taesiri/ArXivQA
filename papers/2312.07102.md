# [Calibration-free quantitative phase imaging in multi-core fiber   endoscopes using end-to-end deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) through multi-core fibers (MCFs) is an emerging technique for minimally invasive in vivo endoscopic imaging. 
- However, conventional iterative phase retrieval algorithms are computationally demanding, limiting real-time imaging capabilities. A single phase image reconstruction takes over 8 minutes.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors demonstrate a deep learning-based approach to enable real-time QPI through MCFs without calibration.
- An innovative optical system is introduced to automatically generate an open-source dataset of 50,176 paired speckle and phase images from MNIST datasets. This serves as training data.
- A deep neural network (DNN) combines U-Net and ResNet architectures to predict phase images directly from speckle images.

Main Contributions:
- Ultrafast phase reconstruction speed of 5.5 ms per frame, enabling video-rate imaging at 181 fps.
- First open-source dataset specifically tailored for MCF phase imaging for robust DNN training.
-Calibration-free imaging pipeline significantly simplifies the workflow.
- DNN demonstrates excellent performance - mean fidelity of 99.8% for phase reconstruction.
- High reconstruction accuracy shown even for complex patterns like fashion MNIST.
- Advancement strengthens potential for MCF phase imaging techniques for real-time in vivo applications.

In summary, this work addresses a key limitation in MCF phase imaging by developing an end-to-end deep learning approach to achieve real-time, high-fidelity and calibration-free quantitative phase reconstruction. The generated dataset and proposed methodology help overcome barriers to practical adoption of such techniques.
