# [Calibration-free quantitative phase imaging in multi-core fiber   endoscopes using end-to-end deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07102)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper demonstrates a deep learning-based approach for achieving real-time quantitative phase imaging (QPI) through multi-core fiber (MCF) endoscopes. An innovative optical system is introduced that automatically generates over 50,000 paired speckle and phase images to serve as an experimental training dataset tailored for MCF phase imaging. By training a deep neural network (DNN) on this dataset, the authors achieve calibration-free QPI directly from speckle images with just 5.5 ms processing time per frame, enabling video-rate reconstruction at 181 fps. The trained DNN shows excellent phase reconstruction performance on the test datasets with fidelities up to 99.8%. This advancement in reconstruction speed and ease of use broadens the applicability of fiber-based QPI for real-time in vivo imaging in hard-to-reach areas requiring minimal invasiveness. Overall, this work underscores the potential of integrating deep learning techniques to push the frontiers of high-speed lensless endoscopic imaging.
