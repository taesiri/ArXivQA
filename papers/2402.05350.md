# [Descanning: From Scanned to the Original Images with a Color Correction   Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Definition:
- The paper defines a new image restoration problem called "descanning", which refers to restoring the original high-quality images from scanned copies. 
- Scanned images suffer from various distortions during printing, storing, and scanning processes. These are categorized into color-related degradations (CDs) like color fading, and non-color-related degradations (NCDs) like noises, textures, etc.

Main Contributions:
- A large-scale dataset called DESCAN-18K is introduced, containing 18K pairs of real scanned images and their original versions. The degradations are analyzed and categorized.

- A descanning model called DescanDiffusion is proposed, consisting of two main components:
   1) A color encoder that corrects the global color distribution of scanned images to match the original ones.
   2) A conditional DDPM that refines the images locally using a denoising diffusion process.

- Additional synthetic scanned data is generated to improve generalization. Experiments show DescanDiffusion restores complex mixtures of degradations effectively and outperforms other image restoration models, including commercial products.

In summary, this paper tackles the practical image restoration problem of converting low-quality scanned images to their original high-quality versions. Both an informative dataset and a dedicated two-stage model are designed to address this task. The method demonstrates strong performance and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new image restoration approach called DescanDiffusion, consisting of a color encoder for global color correction and a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model for local generative refinement, to address the novel problem of restoring high-quality images from degraded scanned copies containing multiple complex distortions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It defines a new image restoration problem called "descanning", which refers to restoring the original images from scanned copies by removing complex distortions introduced in the scanning process. 

2. It builds a large-scale dataset called DESCAN-18K with 18,360 pairs of scanned images and their original versions to facilitate research on the descanning problem. The dataset contains diverse image contents and multiple types of degradations commonly seen in real-world scanned images.

3. It proposes a new image restoration model called DescanDiffusion, composed of a color encoder for global color correction and a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model for local generative refinement. The model is tailored to address the multiple degradations in scanned images.

4. It provides comprehensive experiments and analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DescanDiffusion model in restoring scanned images. The model outperforms other baselines including commercial products.

In summary, the main contribution is defining the novel descanning problem, building a dataset for it, and proposing a dedicated solution to address this problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Descanning - The paper defines a new image restoration problem of restoring the original digital image from a scanned copy. This process is termed as "descanning".

- DESCAN-18K dataset - A large-scale dataset introduced in the paper containing 18,360 pairs of scanned images and corresponding original digital images. It contains complex degradations found in real-world scanned images.

- Degradations - The paper categorizes degradations in scanned images into two types - color-related degradations (CD) and non-color related degradations (NCD). These include things like noise, color fading, halftone patterns, etc. 

- DescanDiffusion - The image restoration model proposed in the paper to address the descanning problem. It consists of a color encoder module for global color correction and a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for local refinements.

- Diffusion models - DescanDiffusion is based on diffusion models, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), which have shown promise for image generation and restoration tasks recently.

- Generalization - The paper demonstrates the generalization ability of DescanDiffusion to restore images scanned from unseen scanner types not present in the training data.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a global color correction module and a local generative refinement module. What is the motivation behind this two-step approach? Why not use a single model to correct both color and local degradations?

2. The color encoder predicts the mean and standard deviation of the R, G, B channels. Why predict these simple statistics rather than a more complex color distribution model? Have the authors experimented with other ways to model the color distribution?

3. The paper claims the color encoder provides a superior starting point for the diffusion model compared to using histogram matching. What is the evidence to support this claim? How big is the performance difference?

4. The diffusion model is conditioned on both the color-corrected image and the color correction vector. What is the effect of each of these conditions individually? Is using both together critical for good performance? 

5. What diffusion model architecture choices were explored? Why was the unconditional DDPM model chosen over alternatives like DDIM or DDPM++?

6. The synthetic data generation scheme simulates several types of degradations. What is the evidence that these synthetic degradations accurately reflect real scanned image degradations? 

7. What was the process and rationale behind selecting the ratio of synthetic to real training data? Was an ablation performed to validate the 25%/75% split?

8. The inference time is slower compared to CNN/Transformer-based methods. Were any modifications explored to reduce inference latency, such as using a distillation token?

9. The model generalizes well to unseen scanner types. Does performance decrease substantially when evaluated on very different scanner types than those in the dataset? 

10. What aspects of the model design are specific for handling scanned image degradations vs general real-world image degradations? Could this method apply broadly to other real-world restoration tasks?
