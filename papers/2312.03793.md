# [AnimateZero: Video Diffusion Models are Zero-Shot Image Animators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models lack precise control over appearance and motion during video generation. The process is like a black box.
- Decoupling appearance and motion control can enable better controllability. Image animation methods separate a video into a single keyframe and corresponding motion. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AnimateZero, a zero-shot method to modify pre-trained T2V models to enable step-by-step controllable video generation from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-video (I2V).

- It inserts T2I intermediate latents into video generation to control first frame appearance.

- It replaces T2V global temporal attention with "positional-corrected window attention" to align other frames with first frame.

- Together this achieves spatial appearance control and temporal consistency control without re-training the T2V model.

Key Contributions:
- First work to unveil pre-trained T2V diffusion models to be zero-shot image animators. Enables controllable video generation and applications like interactive video creation.

- Achieves control over appearance by ensuring first frame matches given T2I image, and control over motion by explicitly aligning other frames.

- Experiments highlight AnimateZero's consistency with text prompts and T2I domains over baseline T2V model, and achieves comparable or better performance than current I2V methods across metrics.

In summary, the key idea is to modify pre-trained T2V models to enable precise appearance and motion control in a zero-shot fashion, proving their potential as image animators. This unveils new possibilities for controllable video generation and applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes AnimateZero, a method to modify pre-trained text-to-video diffusion models to enable controllable video generation by decoupling the appearance and motion aspects to achieve zero-shot image animation for generated images from text-to-image models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing AnimateZero, a novel controllable video generation method that modifies the architecture of pre-trained video diffusion models (specifically AnimateDiff) to enable:

1) Step-by-step video generation from text-to-image to image-to-video in a zero-shot manner, without requiring additional training. This is achieved by spatial appearance control to make the first frame identical to a given generated image and temporal consistency control to align other frames.

2) More precise control over appearance and motion in video generation by decoupling these two aspects. Users can first generate a satisfactory image and then animate it into a video.

3) Potential for various applications like interactive video generation, real image animation, etc. by proving video diffusion models can be zero-shot image animators for given images.

In summary, the key novelty is unveiling the black-box generation process of pre-trained video diffusion models through architectural modifications, allowing better controllability and enabling new applications, all in a zero-shot manner without needing to train models.

The paper proposes a new method called "AnimateZero" which modifies the architecture of pre-trained video diffusion models like AnimateDiff to enable more controllable video generation. Specifically, it introduces spatial appearance control and temporal consistency control to separate and control the appearance and motion of generated videos respectively. The goal is to achieve zero-shot image animation of generated images from text-to-image models. Key terms like "appearance control", "motion control", "spatial appearance control", "temporal consistency control" are associated with the proposed method. The paper also evaluates AnimateZero for image animation tasks by comparing it with existing text-to-video and image-to-video diffusion models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes both spatial appearance control and temporal consistency control. Explain the key ideas behind each and how they enable the zero-shot image animation capability of the method. 

2. Explain the modifications made to the attention mechanism in the temporal consistency control, including the shift from global attention to window attention, duplicating tokens from the first frame, and the position embedding corrections. Why are these important?

3. How exactly does the paper insert intermediate latents from a pre-trained T2I model into the video generation process? What is the purpose and benefit of doing this?

4. What are the advantages and limitations of basing the method on the AnimateDiff architecture? How could this be extended to other video diffusion models? 

5. The method claims to work in a zero-shot manner without retraining. What evidence supports this claim? Are there any parts that still require tuning or hyperparameters?

6. How does the performance of AnimateZero compare quantitatively and qualitatively to AnimateDiff? What metrics were used to measure this?

7. What applications are enabled by the controllable video generation capability? How could this be utilized in areas like video editing? 

8. What are the limitations of the motion prior in AnimateDiff that restrict the capabilities of AnimateZero? How could this be addressed in future work? 

9. Could this method be applied to real images instead of just generated images? What challenges would need to be overcome?

10. The paper compares to other image-to-video diffusion models. How does AnimateZero differ in terms of requiring the first frame to match the reference image? What advantages does this provide?
