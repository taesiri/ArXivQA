# [AnimateZero: Video Diffusion Models are Zero-Shot Image Animators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models lack precise control over appearance and motion during video generation. The process is like a black box.
- Decoupling appearance and motion control can enable better controllability. Image animation methods separate a video into a single keyframe and corresponding motion. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AnimateZero, a zero-shot method to modify pre-trained T2V models to enable step-by-step controllable video generation from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-video (I2V).

- It inserts T2I intermediate latents into video generation to control first frame appearance.

- It replaces T2V global temporal attention with "positional-corrected window attention" to align other frames with first frame.

- Together this achieves spatial appearance control and temporal consistency control without re-training the T2V model.

Key Contributions:
- First work to unveil pre-trained T2V diffusion models to be zero-shot image animators. Enables controllable video generation and applications like interactive video creation.

- Achieves control over appearance by ensuring first frame matches given T2I image, and control over motion by explicitly aligning other frames.

- Experiments highlight AnimateZero's consistency with text prompts and T2I domains over baseline T2V model, and achieves comparable or better performance than current I2V methods across metrics.

In summary, the key idea is to modify pre-trained T2V models to enable precise appearance and motion control in a zero-shot fashion, proving their potential as image animators. This unveils new possibilities for controllable video generation and applications.
