# [Explicit Visual Prompting for Low-Level Structure Segmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10883)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:

How can we develop a unified approach that performs well across various low-level structure segmentation tasks, including forgery detection, shadow detection, defocus blur detection, and camouflaged object detection? 

The key hypothesis is that by taking inspiration from pre-training and prompt tuning approaches in NLP, they can develop a new visual prompting model called Explicit Visual Prompting (EVP) that leverages explicit visual features from individual images to efficiently adapt a single model to diverse segmentation tasks. Their hypothesis is that EVP can significantly outperform other parameter-efficient tuning methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to task-specific solutions.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop a unified segmentation model for diverse low-level tasks. The key hypothesis is that explicit visual prompting based on image features can enable efficient tuning and strong performance across tasks compared to specialized models.
