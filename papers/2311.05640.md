## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces large Finnish language models FinGPT and BLUUMI trained on a diverse dataset of Finnish text. The models are evaluated on Finnish tasks and assessed for alignment, bias and toxicity. The largest model BLUUMI, obtained by continued pretraining of the multilingual BLOOM, substantially outperforms prior Finnish models while retaining English capability.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces several new large language models for Finnish, a lesser-resourced language spoken by less than 6 million people. The authors compiled an extensive dataset of Finnish text from diverse sources including web crawls, news, social media, Wikipedia, and books. They trained seven monolingual Finnish models from scratch with sizes ranging from 185 million to 13 billion parameters, as well as continued pretraining of the 176 billion parameter multilingual BLOOM model on a mix of its original data and Finnish data to create a model called BLUUMI. The models were evaluated on a new Finnish task suite called FIN-bench across few-shot settings. Results showed the monolingual models outperformed prior Finnish models, with performance generally improving with model size up to 8 billion parameters. BLUUMI also substantially outperformed the original BLOOM on Finnish tasks without losing capabilities on English tasks. Additional evaluations assessed model alignment, bias, and toxicity. The study demonstrates approaches for training high-quality models for lesser-resourced languages given limited data availability. The resulting models and evaluation resources advance the state of the art for natural language processing in Finnish.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces new large language models for Finnish, a lesser-resourced language spoken by fewer than 6 million people. The authors compiled an extensive Finnish dataset by combining web crawls, news, social media, ebooks, and other sources. They trained seven monolingual Finnish models from scratch, with sizes ranging from 185 million to 13 billion parameters. They also performed continued pretraining of the 176 billion parameter multilingual BLOOM model on a mix of its original training data and Finnish, creating a model called BLUUMI. To evaluate the models, the authors introduced FIN-bench, a version of BIG-bench adapted for Finnish. In few-shot evaluations, their models outperformed previous Finnish models, with the 8 billion parameter monolingual model achieving the best results. Continued pretraining substantially improved BLOOM's Finnish capabilities without compromising English performance. The authors also analyzed model alignment, bias, and toxicity, finding limitations that provide avenues for future improvement. Overall, the study provides a template for creating large models for lesser-resourced languages and introduces new state-of-the-art models for Finnish.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces new large Finnish language models including monolingual models up to 13B parameters and a 176B multilingual model, evaluates their capabilities on a new Finnish benchmark, and analyzes their alignment, bias and toxicity.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: What are the challenges of creating large language models for Finnish, a lesser-resourced language, and how can these challenges be addressed? 

The authors aim to study the feasibility and approaches for developing capable large language models for Finnish, which has limited training data compared to high-resource languages like English that most prior work has focused on. Their main goals are:

1) To compile a broad-coverage dataset of Finnish text from diverse sources for pretraining the models. 

2) To pretrain both monolingual Finnish models up to 13 billion parameters and also continue pretraining the multilingual BLOOM model by mixing in Finnish data.

3) To evaluate the capabilities of the resulting models using a newly introduced evaluation dataset for Finnish and additional assessments of alignment, bias, and toxicity.

4) To make the models, tools, and resources openly available to support research and applications for Finnish language processing.

Overall, the central hypothesis is that with careful data collection and model training strategies, it is feasible to create capable large language models even for lesser-resourced languages like Finnish. The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical experiments and analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- Compiling an extensive dataset of Finnish text from diverse sources such as web crawls, news, social media, eBooks, etc. to train large language models. The final preprocessed dataset consists of 38 billion tokens.

- Training several monolingual Finnish language models from scratch with up to 13 billion parameters, as well as continued pretraining of the multilingual 176B parameter BLOOM model on Finnish data to create the BLUUMI model. This represents a significant advance in model size and capability for Finnish.

- Introducing a new few-shot evaluation benchmark called FIN-bench for assessing Finnish language model capabilities, adapted from BIG-bench. 

- Evaluating the models on FIN-bench and other tests, finding substantially improved capability compared to prior Finnish models. The models and evaluation data are made openly available.

- Analyzing and attempting to reduce model toxicity, bias, and lack of alignment through data filtering and other techniques.

So in summary, the main contributions are creating much larger Finnish language models than previously available, evaluating their capabilities extensively, and releasing the models and data to advance Finnish NLP.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on large language models for smaller or low-resource languages:

- Dataset Collection: The authors compile a broad and diverse dataset for Finnish by combining multiple sources including web crawls, news, books, and social media. This continues a trend in recent work of utilizing varied data sources to create pretraining datasets for lesser-resourced languages.

- Monolingual Models: The approach of training a range of monolingual models from 185M to 13B parameters aligns with recent work on building dedicated models for smaller languages like Icelandic and Lithuanian. The scale achieved here for Finnish is greater than prior work.

- Multilingual Model: Continued pretraining of the multilingual BLOOM model to add Finnish while retaining performance in other languages has parallels in other work on extending multilingual models. The model size of 176B parameters is very large by current standards.

- Evaluations: Introducing comprehensive evaluations like FIN-bench and assessing model qualities beyond just accuracy like bias and toxicity follows recent trends in responsible and rigorous evaluation of LLMs.

- Limitations: The authors transparently acknowledge limitations related to data availability and quality, bias, toxicity, and replication. Discussing societal implications sets a good example.

Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions in pushing the state of the art for Finnish specifically, but also demonstrates good practices like diverse data collection, rigorous evaluation, and transparency about limitations that are highly relevant for research on lower-resource languages more broadly. The scale of models like 13B monolingual and 176B multilingual is at the leading edge globally.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further improving the alignment, reducing bias, and mitigating toxicity of the models through techniques like instruction tuning. The authors note limitations in these areas that need to be addressed before the models can be responsibly deployed in real-world applications.

- Exploring more efficient and environmentally sustainable approaches for training large language models for lesser-resourced languages. The authors aim to continue their work on this.

- Increasing the amount of high-quality Finnish text available for pretraining, possibly through data augmentation techniques or mixing in data from other modalities like code. This could help improve model performance, especially for the largest monolingual models. 

- Studying multitask training and determining optimal model sizes for different amounts of training data. The authors found some inconsistencies in their results that warrant further investigation in these areas.

- Evaluating the models on a broader range of tasks and datasets beyond FIN-bench. Extending the analysis of model capabilities and limitations.

- Performing further alignment fine-tuning and testing methods to create well-aligned foundation models that can be safely leveraged for downstream applications.

- Applying the training and evaluation methodology to other lesser-resourced languages to create models for them.

In summary, the main directions are improving model safety and usability, efficiency and sustainability of training, maximizing performance on limited data through data augmentation and model optimization, and extending the work to more languages.
