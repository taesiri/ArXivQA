# [LLMs with Chain-of-Thought Are Non-Causal Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16048)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is used in large language models (LLMs) to elicit step-by-step reasoning and improve performance, but empirically there is a mismatch between CoT correctness and answer correctness. 

- The paper finds that across models and tasks, there is a surprising frequency of correct answers despite incorrect CoTs, and vice versa. This indicates potential issues with reasoning in LLMs.

Methodology:
- The paper frames CoT reasoning in LLMs using causal analysis, modeling it as a structural causal model (SCM) with three key variables: Instruction, CoT, and Answer.  

- Four types of SCMs are proposed to characterize how CoT and answers are connected in LLMs: Causal Chain (ideal), Full Connection (default LLM), Common Cause (disconnected), and Isolated Answer (extreme disconnection).

- Interventions are used to uncover the implied SCM in LLMs across tasks, revealing the strength of causal connections between variables. The inferred SCM is compared to human reasoning.

Key Findings:
- LLMs show varying SCMs across different tasks - larger models tend to have more optimal SCM types, but this is not guaranteed. Suboptimal SCMs likely lead to reasoning errors.  

- Factors like in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning impact the causal links, especially between Instruction and Answer. This highlights issues in common LLM techniques.

Implications:
- There are noticeable discrepancies between LLM and human reasoning processes in terms of causal structures. The analysis provides a framework to anticipate potential LLM mistakes.

- More research is needed to develop faithful reasoning in LLMs. Causal analysis marks a preliminary step towards reliable and transparent LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores the causal relationship between chain-of-thought reasoning and model decisions in large language models, finding that the implied structural causal models vary across models and tasks, with techniques like in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning affecting the causal links.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using causal analysis to assess the cause-effect relationship between chain-of-thought (CoT) and answers in large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- The paper conducts experiments showing CoT does not consistently improve task performance or align with human reasoning. For example, there are frequent instances of correct answers following incorrect CoTs and vice versa. 

- The paper employs interventions to uncover the structural causal models (SCMs) that LLMs approximate in different tasks. It shows LLMs exhibit varying SCM types across tasks, often influenced by spurious correlations. 

- The paper links the identified SCM types to potential reasoning errors in LLMs. It provides an analysis framework for anticipating mistakes based on discrepancies from human reasoning SCMs.

- The paper investigates factors influencing the LLM-implied SCMs, finding techniques like in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning impact causal structures. This suggests commonly used LLM methods may not enhance reasoning.

In summary, the key contribution is using causal analysis of CoTs to reveal limitations in LLM reasoning and providing insights into developing more reliable LLMs. The analysis of causal structures offers a new perspective on comprehending how LLMs operate.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Chain of Thought (CoT) - The step-by-step reasoning process used by large language models. The analysis explores the causal relationship between CoT and model answers.

- Causal analysis - The paper analyzes the cause-effect relationships between instructions/CoT and answers using interventions to uncover the structural causal models that language models approximate. 

- Structural Causal Models (SCM) - Causal graphical models representing the data generative process. The study identifies 4 main types of SCMs that capture different reasoning behaviors.

- Reasoning errors - The analysis links the identified SCM types to potential reasoning errors like correct answers from incorrect CoT.

- In-context learning (ICL) - Providing demonstrations to influence model behavior. The study explores the effect of ICL examples on causal relationships.  

- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) - Fine-tuning models on human instruction-answer pairs. Shown to intensify the spurious correlation between instructions and answers.

- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - Aligning models to human preferences. Found to diminish the link between instructions and answers.

In summary, the key focus is on using causal analysis and interventions to evaluate the CoT reasoning process in language models, reveal the gaps from human reasoning, and understand factors influencing the identified discrepancies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses using interventions to uncover the structural causal model (SCM) that large language models (LLMs) approximate. What are some limitations or challenges with using interventions at scale to analyze the reasoning process of large LLMs?

2. The paper defines a "ladder of causal structures" where larger LLMs tend to have more optimal (Type I) SCMs. However, the data shows some inconsistencies. What factors might explain why larger LLMs do not always sit higher on this ladder? 

3. The analysis links the identified SCM types to potential reasoning errors made by LLMs. Can you expand more on why certain SCM types are more prone to certain errors? What other error types might emerge?

4. The paper finds supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strengthens spurious correlations between instructions and answers. What modifications could be made to SFT methods to diminish this effect while still enhancing performance?

5. Causal interventions are performed on simplified reasoning tasks in a controlled setting. How might the analysis differ if applied to more complex, open-ended reasoning? What are difficulties in scaling up the analysis?

6. The paper compares the LLM-implied SCM to human reasoning. What other cognitive science theories or models could further inform the analysis of LLM reasoning processes?

7. How robust is the ladder of causal structures finding - if different definitions/thresholds were used for the SCM types, would the finding still hold? How could the classification be strengthened?

8. The paper analyzes changes over model size and technique. How might the causal analysis differ over other factors like architecture, objective function, data domain? What findings might emerge?

9. The paper links techniques like SFT to weaker coherence between CoT and answers. Could adjusting these techniques to focus more on causal relations improve reasoning capability? What might that entail?

10. The analysis relies on simple correlation metrics between CoT and answers. Could more sophisticated semantic similarity measures reveal additional insights into the coherence of reasoning? What measures seem promising?
