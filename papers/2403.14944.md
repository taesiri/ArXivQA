# [CLIP-VQDiffusion : Langauge Free Training of Text To Image generation   using CLIP and vector quantized diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14944)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Text conditional image generation models require large paired text-image datasets which are costly to create. Famous face datasets like FFHQ don't have text descriptions, making it difficult to train text-to-image models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose CLIP-VQDiffusion, which leverages CLIP to provide text-image multimodal representations for language-free training of text-to-image generation. 
- It uses a vector quantized (VQ) diffusion model as the image generator. During training, CLIP image embeddings are provided as the condition instead of text embeddings. 
- At inference time, CLIP text embeddings can be used to generate corresponding images, thanks to the learned text-image multimodal representations.
- Gaussian noise is added to CLIP image embeddings during training to create "pseudo" text embeddings that better connect the text and image spaces.
- Classifier-free guidance is used during finetuning to further improve image quality.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a way to train text-to-image models without paired text-image datasets, using only images.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art for language-free training on FFHQ, outperforming prior works by 4.4% in CLIP score.
- Generates high quality and diverse images on FFHQ and COCO datasets, which align well with text conditions including out-of-distribution texts.
- Provides an effective way to leverage powerful CLIP representations for language-free conditional image generation.

In summary, the paper introduces a highly effective approach for text-to-image generation without paired text data by bringing together CLIP and vector quantized diffusion models. The results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in language-free training.
