# [ControlVideo: Training-free Controllable Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we enable efficient and high-quality controllable text-to-video generation without requiring heavy training of large-scale video generative models? The key hypothesis is that by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and incorporating motion sequences as coarse structure guidance, it is possible to synthesize high-quality and temporally consistent videos without extensive training. Specifically, the paper proposes that by adapting the image diffusion model ControlNet to the video domain through techniques like cross-frame interaction and adding modules like the interleaved-frame smoother, training-free controllable text-to-video generation can be achieved.In summary, the core hypothesis is that training-free text-to-video generation is feasible by building upon pre-trained text-to-image models and using motion sequences, rather than requiring end-to-end training of massive video generative models. The research aims to validate this hypothesis through the proposed ControlVideo framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a training-free framework called ControlVideo for controllable text-to-video generation. ControlVideo leverages the generation capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image models like ControlNet and the coarse temporal consistency from input motion sequences to produce videos without needing to train a full text-to-video model from scratch.2. Introducing a fully cross-frame interaction mechanism in ControlVideo to ensure appearance consistency between video frames by allowing all frames to interact via attention. This helps maintain the high image quality of the pre-trained model.3. Proposing an interleaved-frame smoother module that helps reduce structural flickering in videos by smoothing transitions between frames via frame interpolation. 4. Presenting a hierarchical sampling strategy to enable efficient synthesis of long videos by breaking the video into coherent short clips and generating them sequentially.5. Demonstrating superior video quality and temporal consistency compared to prior controllable video generation methods, while enabling efficient video synthesis in just a few minutes on a single GPU.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the propose of ControlVideo, a training-free approach to high-quality and consistent controllable text-to-video generation that is efficient and accessible with commodity hardware. The method cleverly adapts and extends image generation models using proposed techniques like cross-frame interaction and hierarchical sampling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes ControlVideo, a training-free framework for controllable text-to-video generation that produces temporally consistent videos by adapting ControlNet to video and introducing cross-frame interaction, frame smoothing, and hierarchical sampling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other recent research on controllable text-to-video generation:- This paper proposes a training-free framework called ControlVideo, which is adapted from the image counterpart ControlNet. In contrast, many other approaches like Tune-A-Video and Text2Video-Zero require some amount of finetuning or training on video data. Avoiding training makes this method more accessible.- The paper introduces fully cross-frame interaction to ensure appearance consistency between frames without sacrificing video quality. Other methods like Tune-A-Video and Text2Video-Zero use sparser cross-frame attention mechanisms that can degrade quality.- An interleaved-frame smoother is proposed to reduce flickering across the whole video. This type of explicit smoothing technique is unique compared to prior work. - A hierarchical sampler enables efficient synthesis of long videos with commodity GPUs. Other recent methods have focused on shorter videos or require more expensive hardware.- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a newly collected benchmark of motion-prompt pairs. Both quantitative metrics and user studies show improvements over baselines.- The approach generates videos in higher resolution (512x512) than some other controllable video synthesis methods that operate at lower resolutions like 256x256.Overall, the training-free nature, proposed consistency and smoothing techniques, efficient hierarchical sampling, and strong experimental results help advance controllable text-to-video generation, while avoiding the high training costs of large-scale video models. The ability to leverage pre-trained image models is a notable advantage over methods that require full video model training.
