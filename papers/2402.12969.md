# [GlórIA -- A Generative and Open Large Language Model for Portuguese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a shortage of large language models (LLMs), resources, and benchmarks for European Portuguese (PT-PT) compared to English and other high-resource languages. Existing PT-PT models are limited in scale and generative capabilities.

Proposed Solution - GlórIA:
- The authors propose GlórIA, a new 1.3B parameter decoder-only LLM for PT-PT based on the GPT-Neo architecture. 
- They assemble a diverse PT-PT corpus from multiple sources totaling 35 billion tokens for pretraining GlórIA. The data comprises web crawls, news, encyclopedic text, subtitles and parliament dialogs.
- Pretrain GlórIA for 3 million steps using causal language modeling objective. The model shows steady performance improvements during pretraining.

Main Contributions:
- Assemble large 35B token PT-PT corpus from diverse sources for pretraining models.
- Release GlórIA, first large open-sourced decoder LLM focused on PT-PT language generation.
- Introduce CALAME-PT, the first Portuguese language modeling benchmark for evaluating decoder LLMs.
- Evaluation shows GlórIA outperforms prior Portuguese decoder models significantly on CALAME-PT and generates coherent text across diverse domains.
- Strong performance compared to encoder models on discriminative tasks like GLUE-PTPT.
- Enable future work on scaling up models for PT-PT and advancing Portuguese NLP.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards advancing decoder-based LLMs for European Portuguese via datasets, models and benchmarks to enable future research.
