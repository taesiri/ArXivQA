# Exploring Prompt-based Few-shot Learning for Grounded Dialog Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How effective is a prompt-based method for few-shot learning in grounded dialog generation tasks? The key points are:- The paper proposes using continuous or discrete prompts to distinguish the different input constructs (grounding source, conversation context, different speakers' utterances) in grounded dialog tasks. This aims to help the model better handle the more complex inputs in these tasks.- Experiments are conducted with GPT2 to evaluate different prompt initialization methods and show that properly initialized prompts boost few-shot performance over no prompts. Discrete prompts generally outperform continuous prompts.- The prompting method is tested on various pre-trained models beyond GPT2, including T5, BART, DialoGPT and Blender. Key findings are that prompted language models like GPT2 and T5 achieve superior performance to conversational models, and prompting effectiveness relies on sufficient model size and suitable pre-training objectives.- Overall, the central hypothesis is that prompt-based methods can effectively improve few-shot learning for grounded dialog generation. The experiments provide empirical evidence to demonstrate and analyze this.In summary, the key hypothesis is on the utility of prompting for few-shot grounded dialog learning, which is explored through proposed methods and extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the key points about the contributions of this paper:- The paper proposes a simple prompt-based method for few-shot learning in grounded dialog generation tasks. The method uses continuous or discrete prompts to distinguish the complex input constructs (e.g. grounding source vs conversation context) in grounded dialog.- The paper empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed prompting method on three typical grounded dialog tasks. Results show that prompting boosts performance compared to not using prompts, especially in the few-shot setting.- The paper conducts extensive experiments to compare how the prompting method works with different pre-trained models. Key findings are:  - Prompted language models (GPT2, T5) achieve better performance than conversational models (DialoGPT, Blender)  - Prompting is effective across different model architectures but relies on large model size and general pre-training objectives  - Discrete prompts generally outperform continuous prompts- Overall, the paper explores prompt-based few-shot learning for grounded dialog generation, and provides analysis and insights about how prompting interacts with different pre-trained models in this setting. The work reveals the potential of prompting methods for low-resource grounded dialog tasks.In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating a simple yet effective prompt-based method to improve few-shot learning for grounded dialog tasks, as well as thoroughly investigating its effectiveness across different pre-trained models.
