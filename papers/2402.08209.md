# [Thresholding Data Shapley for Data Cleansing Using Multi-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Thresholding Data Shapley for Data Cleansing Using Multi-Armed Bandits":

Problem:
- Data cleansing aims to improve model performance by removing harmful training instances. 
- Data Shapley is an effective method to evaluate the contribution of each instance, but requires training on all subsets of data, which is computationally expensive.
- The paper tackles the problem of efficiently identifying a subset of instances with low Data Shapley values for data cleansing.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulates data cleansing as a thresholding multi-armed bandit problem, where the goal is to identify arms (instances) below a threshold.
- Proposes Thresholding Data Shapley (TDShap) method that uses the Anytime Parameter-free Thresholding (APT) bandit algorithm to iteratively estimate which instances have Data Shapley values below a threshold.
- Provides 3 enhancements to make TDShap faster and more accurate:
   1. Restriction on training subset cardinality to prevent overfitting
   2. Evaluating multiple instances per iteration
   3. Pre-training using the full dataset to reduce training time
   
Main Contributions:
- Formulation of data cleansing as a thresholding bandit problem
- TDShap method for efficient identification of low-Data Shapley instances 
- Theoretical guarantee on accuracy of TDShap based on bandit theory
- Empirical evaluation showing TDShap is much faster than Data Shapley and Leave-One-Out while maintaining accuracy
- Enhancements to improve speed and accuracy further

In summary, the paper proposes a novel thresholding bandit approach to efficiently solve the data cleansing problem by identifying low contributing instances. The TDShap method is shown to be effective both theoretically and empirically.
