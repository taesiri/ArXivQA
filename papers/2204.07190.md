# [Measuring Compositional Consistency for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07190)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we better evaluate compositional visual reasoning in video question answering models, beyond just looking at overall accuracy?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Breaking down compositional questions into sub-question DAGs will allow more granular analysis of where and why models fail at compositional reasoning. 

2) Models may exhibit "right for the wrong reasons" behavior, where they answer complex questions correctly despite failing at intermediate reasoning steps.

3) Models may make inconsistent predictions across related sub-questions, indicating a lack of true compositional reasoning. 

The paper introduces a framework for decomposing compositional questions into DAGs of sub-questions in order to test these hypotheses. It proposes new metrics like compositional accuracy, internal consistency, and "right for the wrong reasons" to provide more nuanced evaluation. The experiments seem focused on validating whether these new metrics based on question DAGs reveal limitations in compositional reasoning for current VQA models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a question decomposition engine that transforms a compositional question into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of simpler sub-questions. This allows for a more nuanced evaluation of video question answering models beyond just accuracy, using novel metrics like compositional accuracy, right for wrong reasons, and internal consistency. The paper also contributes a new benchmark dataset called AGQA-Decomp, containing over 4 million sub-questions associated with compositional questions in the AGQA dataset. By evaluating models on the DAGs, the authors find that state-of-the-art VQA models still struggle with compositional reasoning and rely on spurious correlations. The decomposed DAG structure enables identifying failure modes and inconsistent reasoning in models.

In summary, the key contributions are:

- A question decomposition engine to produce DAGs of sub-questions from compositional questions 

- The AGQA-Decomp benchmark with over 4 million sub-questions 

- Novel evaluation metrics like compositional accuracy and internal consistency

- Analysis showing current VQA models still struggle with compositional reasoning, even when accurate

- The DAG structure enables better understanding of model failure modes and inconsistencies


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a method to decompose compositional visual reasoning questions into graphs of simpler sub-questions and uses these graphs to analyze whether video question answering models can reason compositionally.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper focuses specifically on analyzing compositional reasoning in video question answering models, whereas much prior work has looked at compositional reasoning more broadly across vision and language tasks. The video QA setting allows the authors to design precise compositional reasoning tests using spatio-temporal relationships.

- The paper introduces a new question decomposition approach to generate hierarchies of sub-questions from complex compositional questions. This differs from prior decomposition methods like in Neuro-Symbolic Visual Reasoning that rely on syntactic dependency parses. The hand-designed decomposition enables targeted tests. 

- The paper proposes several novel metrics beyond accuracy for evaluating compositional reasoning, like compositional accuracy and internal consistency. Many prior studies still use standard accuracy, which can miss important failures in reasoning. The new metrics allow more thorough analysis.

- The paper studies compositional consistency in detail, including measuring whether models contradict themselves on related sub-questions. Most prior consistency evaluations just test if models are consistent on logically equivalent variants of the same question. Testing consistency throughout a reasoning hierarchy is more thorough.

- The compositional tests are targeted to specific relationships and compositions, as opposed to evaluating on broad benchmarks. This pinpoints model limitations. For example, models struggled with Choose and Equals compositions.

- Analysis is performed on state-of-the-art models for the task. Many recent consistency studies test simpler baseline models. Demonstrating failures on complex models like HCRN shows consistency issues persist despite advances.

Overall, the paper makes excellent progress in rigorously analyzing compositional reasoning for video QA. The decomposition approach, novel consistency metrics, and targeted tests allow thorough investigation of the limitations of current models. The analysis helps point the way forward for improving compositional reasoning in video QA models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Using consistency as a training loss: The authors suggest using consistency as an additional training signal to encourage models to behave compositionally, using large language models to generate consistent data augmentations. 

- Interactive model inspection: The authors propose exploring question DAGs as a tool for interactively analyzing model behavior on individual examples, since their metrics are motivated by how models that reason compositionally should behave.

- Explanations through question decompositions: The authors suggest using model answers to question hierarchies as justifications of predictions, with each answer explaining intermediate reasoning steps. 

- Expanding decomposition structure to other benchmarks: The authors encourage expanding the question decomposition structure to other VQA benchmarks beyond AGQA to create new evaluation methods.

- Consistency for trusting models: The authors suggest internal consistency could help determine whether to trust model predictions.

- Analysis beyond accuracy: The authors aim to analyze compositional visual reasoning beyond just accuracy.

In summary, the main future directions are leveraging the question decomposition structure for training, explanation, interactive analysis, and evaluation on new benchmarks. The overarching goal is moving beyond standard accuracy to better understand compositional reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a question decomposition engine that converts compositional questions into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of sub-questions. The engine decomposes questions from the AGQA benchmark into intermediate reasoning steps, exposing model performance on subsets of reasoning. This enables analyzing which compositions cause models to struggle and testing whether models are right for the right reasons. The authors construct the AGQA-Decomp benchmark containing question graphs and design novel metrics like compositional accuracy and internal consistency to evaluate models. They find that state-of-the-art video QA models frequently contradict themselves or rely on faulty reasoning to answer compositional questions. The decomposed DAGs provide transparency into models and suggest future work directions in rationales, consistency training objectives and interactive model analysis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a question decomposition engine that breaks down compositional questions about videos into graphs of simpler sub-questions. The goal is to evaluate the compositional reasoning capabilities of video question answering models. The engine takes a complex question as input and outputs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-questions, where each sub-question represents a subset of the reasoning steps needed for the original question. Sub-questions are generated using handcrafted functional programs and natural language templates. The DAG structure shows how sub-questions are composed together using handcrafted composition rules. 

Using this engine, the authors generate a dataset called AGQA-Decomp that contains over 2 million sub-question DAGs with 4.5 million total sub-questions for 9600 videos. They use the DAGs to analyze three state-of-the-art video QA models - HCRN, HME, and PSAC. The models are evaluated using novel metrics that measure compositional accuracy, identifying if models are right for the wrong reasons, and testing for internal consistency. The analyses reveal that the models frequently contradict themselves, rely on faulty reasoning, and struggle with certain types of compositional reasoning like comparisons and temporal reasoning. The decomposed question DAGs enable fine-grained analysis to pinpoint model weaknesses.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a question decomposition engine that breaks down compositional questions from the AGQA video question answering benchmark into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of simpler sub-questions. The engine represents the original compositional question as a functional program, decomposes this program into sub-programs representing intermediate reasoning steps, and converts the sub-programs into natural language sub-questions using hand-designed templates. The sub-questions isolate subsets of reasoning required for the original question, enabling detailed evaluation of models through novel metrics. These metrics measure compositional accuracy on sub-questions, test if models are right for the wrong reasons on the original question, and evaluate whether models are internally consistent across related sub-questions. Using the engine, the authors construct the AGQA-Decomp dataset containing over 2 million sub-question DAGs and use it to analyze three state-of-the-art video QA models. The metrics and dataset provide insights into deficiencies in the models' compositional reasoning abilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of evaluating compositional reasoning in video question answering models. Specifically, it aims to understand why state-of-the-art models struggle with compositional questions, and determine if they are relying on proper compositional reasoning or just exploiting biases in the data.

The key problems and questions the paper is trying to address are:

- Which types of compositional reasoning cause models to make mistakes? Existing benchmarks only show models struggle with compositional questions overall, but don't break down the specific failure modes. 

- Are models answering compositional questions correctly for the right reasons? Or are they relying on biases and correlations in the data instead of proper compositional reasoning?

- Can we measure if models are internally consistent when answering compositional questions? Internal inconsistency may indicate faulty reasoning.

- Can we design better evaluation metrics and benchmarks to diagnose these issues in compositional reasoning?

In summary, the paper aims to gain a deeper understanding of the deficiencies in compositional reasoning of current video QA models, and develop better tools for evaluating and analyzing this key capability.
