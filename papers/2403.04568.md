# [Improved Algorithm for Adversarial Linear Mixture MDPs with Bandit   Feedback and Unknown Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04568)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in adversarial Markov decision processes (MDPs) with linear function approximation, unknown transition dynamics, and bandit feedback. Specifically, it focuses on linear mixture MDPs where the transition kernel is modeled as a linear mixture model with unknown parameters. The goal is to design an algorithm that can learn the optimal policy despite the challenges of:

1. Adversarial and arbitrarily changing losses. 
2. Large/infinite state and action spaces requiring function approximation.
3. Unknown transition dynamics that need to be simultaneously learned.
4. Bandit feedback where only the loss of the visited state-action is revealed.

Previous Approaches and Limitations: 
Prior algorithms either focused only on the tabular adversarial setting or made assumptions like known transitions or full-information feedback. The only existing algorithm for this setting attained an $\tilde{O}(dS^2\sqrt{K} + \sqrt{HSAK})$ regret, with a gap compared to the lower bound of $\Omega(dH\sqrt{K} + \sqrt{HSAK})$. The suboptimal dependence on $S$ arises due to using the transition information of only a single "imaginary" next state, wasting data from other states.

Key Ideas and Contributions:
This paper proposes a new algorithm called VLSUOB-REPS that achieves an improved $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{HS^3K} + \sqrt{HSAK})$ regret. The key ideas are:

1. A new least-squares estimator of the transition parameters using data from all states, not just one state. This fully utilizes all the collected data.

2. A novel application of a self-normalized concentration lemma from the dynamic assortment literature to account for correlations between non-independent noises of different states. This is the first application of this technique in RL.

3. Optimistic online mirror descent updates over the occupancy measure space induced by the estimated transitions. 

The obtained bound is better than prior approaches whenever $H\leq S$ (true in layered MDPs) and also improves existing results for tabular MDPs when $d \leq \sqrt{HA/S}$. The use of data from all states and tools to address resulting technical challenges are the main contributions leading to the improvement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an improved algorithm for adversarial linear mixture MDPs with bandit feedback and unknown transitions, attaining an $\widetilde{O}(d\sqrt{HS^3K} + \sqrt{HSAK})$ regret.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new algorithm called VLSUOB-REPS for adversarial linear mixture MDPs with bandit feedback and unknown transitions. The algorithm achieves an $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{HS^3K} + \sqrt{HSAK})$ regret bound, which improves upon the previous best known regret bound of $\tilde{O}(dS^2\sqrt{K} + \sqrt{HSAK})$ for this setting.

2. It introduces a new least squares estimator to learn the unknown transition parameters, which utilizes the visit information of all states instead of only a single state used in prior work. This helps improve the utilization of data.

3. It adapts a self-normalized concentration lemma from the dynamic assortment literature to handle the non-independent noises introduced by correltions between state transitions. This allows bounding the cumulative estimation error of the transitions for all states simultaneously.

4. As a byproduct, the algorithm also improves the best known regret bound for tabular MDPs when $d \leq \sqrt{HA/S}$.

In summary, the key innovations are a new transition parameter estimator, adapted concentration lemma, and algorithm that together help advance the state-of-the-art for this challenging setting of adversarial linear mixture MDPs. The connections made to the dynamic assortment literature are also novel.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The key innovation of this paper is using the information of all states for estimating the transition parameter, instead of only one state as done previously. What is the main challenge when using all states and how does the paper address this challenge?

2) The paper introduces a new self-normalized concentration lemma (Lemma 3) that is tailored to handle non-independent random noises. What is the intuition behind this lemma and how does it enable using the information of all states?

3) How does the proposed least squares estimator in Equation (4) leverage the visit information of all states? What is the closed-form solution and how is it decomposed to highlight the role of the transition noise term?

4) Explain the generalized elliptical potential lemma (Lemma 9) and its role in deriving the tighter occupancy measure difference bound. How is it designed specifically for the analysis in this paper?

5) The regret bound has improved dependence on the episode length H compared to prior work. Intuitively explain why utilizing information from more states leads to the improvement in terms of H.  

6) Discuss the similarities and differences between the technique used in this paper and value-targeted regression used in prior works on mixture MDPs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

7) The lower bound has a term $\Omega(dH\sqrt{K})$ while the upper bound replaces H with $\sqrt{HS^3}$. Explain why eliminating the dependence on S remains an open challenge.

8) This paper makes a connection between reinforcement learning and the dynamic assortment problem. Explain this connection and discuss if insights from one area can be further borrowed to advance the other.  

9) The techniques introduced in this paper utilize properties of linear mixture MDPs. Discuss the potential and limitations of extending the techniques to more general function approximation settings.

10) The regret bound improves over prior work when $d \leq \sqrt{HA/S}$. Discuss what types of problems satisfy this condition and when the proposed algorithm will be most suitable.
