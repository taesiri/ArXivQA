# [Self-supervised Video Representation Learning by Uncovering   Spatio-temporal Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13426)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we learn effective spatio-temporal video representations in a self-supervised manner without relying on manually labeled data?The main hypothesis is that by designing a pretext task that uncovers spatio-temporal statistics from unlabeled videos, such as locations and motion directions of salient motions, a neural network can be trained to learn powerful and transferable spatio-temporal representations for video understanding.Specifically, the key hypotheses are:1) Learning to uncover spatio-temporal statistics like dominant motions and color changes from videos can serve as an effective pretext task for self-supervised video representation learning. 2) The learned representations can transfer well and achieve strong performance on various downstream video analysis tasks such as action recognition, video retrieval, dynamic scene recognition, etc.3) The proposed pretext task is simple and intuitive yet captures informative spatio-temporal characteristics of videos, compared to techniques like predicting future frames which can be ambiguous.4) Explicitly encoding spatial locations instead of regressing to exact coordinates makes the learning task easier and more feasible.5) A curriculum learning strategy can further boost the representation learning by presenting more difficult examples gradually.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by carefully designing a pretext task based on spatio-temporal statistics, informative and transferable video representations can be learned effectively in a self-supervised manner. The paper conducts experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over several backbone architectures and on various downstream tasks.

Evaluating on diverse architectures shows the generalizability.- Downstream tasks: This paper tests the learned representations on multiple downstream tasks - action recognition, video retrieval, dynamic scene recognition, action similarity labeling. Some other works focus evaluation mainly on action recognition. Evaluating on diverse tasks demonstrates transferability.- Dataset scale: This paper studies the impact of pre-training data scale by experimenting with different portions of Kinetics-400. Some works use smaller datasets like UCF101 or Kinetics-100. Using larger dataset shows potential for further improvement.- Analysis: This paper provides in-depth ablation studies and analysis on factors like pretext task components, backbone networks, pretext vs downstream correlation. Such analysis provides useful insights into self-supervised video representation learning.Overall, the proposed pretext task, comprehensive evaluations, and detailed analysis help advance the field and provide new understanding compared to prior arts.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Investigate the importance of different training samples in improving downstream task performance. The authors suggest it is an interesting direction to study how the large amount of video data could be utilized more efficiently for self-supervised learning.- Explore more clever ways to leverage the inner structure of video for curriculum learning. The authors mention that despite the great success of curriculum learning in images, the curriculum learning of video is not so straightforward and more clever ways that utilize the inner structure of video should be investigated. - Study the relationship between pretext task and downstream task performances. The authors suggest it is an interesting direction to reveal why a better pretext task performance does not always lead to a better downstream task performance.- Explore contrastive learning approaches for self-supervised video representation learning. The authors mention recent success of contrastive learning in images could inspire more works to extend the concept of contrastive learning to the video domain.- Leverage multi-modality sources to enhance self-supervised video representation learning, such as video-audio and video-text joint modeling. - Develop better downstream tasks to evaluate the transferability of self-supervised video representations. The authors suggest the action similarity labeling could serve as a complementary evaluation protocol.- Investigate the effectiveness of different backbone networks. The authors mention this is still an open question and suggest more controlled studies could help understand whether the performance gain is from internal self-supervised learning methods or external network architectures.In summary, the key future directions focus on building better pretext tasks, developing better evaluation protocols, and gaining a deeper understanding of self-supervised video representation learning.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel pretext task for self-supervised video representation learning. The key idea is to train a neural network to uncover spatio-temporal statistical summaries from unlabeled video clips, mimicking how humans quickly grasp impressions of motions and appearances when watching videos. Specifically, the network is asked to identify spatial locations and distributions of the largest motion, the most rapidly changing color region, and the most stable color region over time in a video clip. To encode the spatial locations, the frames are divided into regions using different spatial partitioning patterns. The statistics are quantified into discrete labels which serve as supervision signals for self-supervised representation learning. Several variants of 3D CNNs are employed as backbone networks and trained end-to-end to predict the spatio-temporal statistical labels from video inputs in this pretext task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the learned representations improve various downstream video analysis tasks compared to training from scratch and other self-supervised methods.
