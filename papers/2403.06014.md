# [Hard-label based Small Query Black-box Adversarial Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks using maliciously crafted inputs that cause misclassification. 
- Black-box attacks rely only on predictions from the model and are more practical, but suffer from needing a large number of queries to find adversarial examples.
- Hard-label black-box attacks only have access to the predicted class, making query efficiency even more critical.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Small-Query Black-Box Attack (SQBA) that integrates transfer-based and hard-label based attacks. 
- It uses a surrogate model to generate gradients and guide the search direction. The gradients help accelerate the search compared to random sampling.
- It estimates a second gradient using Monte Carlo sampling for when the surrogate model gradients become ineffective. The two gradients are combined based on their expected reliability.
- A line search finds examples near the decision boundary to improve query efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- A novel transfer-based iterative gradient estimation method to guide the search direction in hard-label black-box attacks.
- The SQBA attack method integrating surrogate model guidance and Monte Carlo stochastic gradients.
- Experiments across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and models demonstrating SQBA achieves much higher attack success rates than benchmarks, especially for small query budgets of 100-250 queries. SQBA needs 5x fewer queries to achieve similar attack performance.
- Analysis of SQBA's robustness against defended models, where performance degrades significantly but still exceeds benchmarks.

In summary, the paper presents a more query-efficient hard-label black-box attack using ideas from transfer-based attacks, while remaining practical by not needing model internals or soft-labels. The higher attack success rate for low queries highlights its real-world applicability.
