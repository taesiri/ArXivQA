# [RicMonk: A Three-Link Brachiation Robot with Passive Grippers for   Energy-Efficient Brachiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Brachiation is an energy-efficient mode of locomotion used by primates like gibbons to swing between branches. Developing robots that can mimic this could enable applications like agricultural surveillance, forest exploration, and biomimetic design. 
- Prior brachiating robots have limitations in only being able to move forwards, requiring active grippers, lacking agility and efficiency. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces RicMonk, a three-link underactuated robot with passive grippers and a tail, designed to enable robust and efficient bi-directional brachiation.

Key Contributions:
- Mechatronic Design: Compact and modular design with 3D printed components. Uses two actuators and a tail structure to resemble a gibbon, enhance agility and inject energy. Employs improved passive grippers over prior work for stability.

- Behavior Generation: Defines atomic "swing" behaviors between fixed configurations. Stitches these together with gripper release/catch heuristics to enable bi-directional brachiation.

- Trajectory Optimization: Uses direct collocation to generate minimum-energy trajectories for the swing maneuvers respecting constraints. Applies heuristics to bridge sim-to-real gap.

- Trajectory Stabilization: Employs time-varying LQR control for trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection on the real system.

- Experimental Validation: Demonstrates robust bi-directional brachiation, tolerance to added weight/disturbances. Compares to prior 2-link robot, shows improved efficiency.

- Reproducibility: Entire system including hardware, software and controllers is open-sourced to enable further research.

In summary, the paper presents a novel brachiating robot designed for efficiency and maneuverability, enabled by optimizations and control. It demonstrates robust bidirectional brachiation in experiments and benchmarks improvements over prior work. The open-source release aims to spur further research.
