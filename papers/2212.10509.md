# Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for   Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we augment chain-of-thought prompting for open-domain, knowledge-intensive tasks that require complex, multi-step reasoning when the necessary knowledge is either unavailable to the LLM or not up-to-date within its parameters?The key hypothesis appears to be that a one-step retrieve-and-read approach using question-based retrieval is insufficient for multi-step reasoning QA. Instead, the authors propose an interleaving approach called IRCoT where retrieval is interleaved with chain-of-thought reasoning steps to mutually guide each other.In summary, the paper aims to address the limitations of one-step question-based retrieval for multi-step open-domain QA by interleaving retrieval with chain-of-thought reasoning steps. The central hypothesis is that this interleaving approach will improve both retrieval and downstream QA performance compared to one-step retrieval methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new approach called IRCoT for multi-step question answering that interleaves retrieval with steps (sentences) in a chain of thought (CoT). The key ideas are:- Using the CoT to guide retrieval, and using retrieved results to improve the CoT in an interleaved, iterative fashion. - This allows retrieving more relevant information for later reasoning steps, compared to standard one-step retrieval using just the question.- Evaluations using GPT3 show substantial gains from IRCoT in both retrieval (up to 21 points) and downstream QA (up to 15 points) over baseline methods on four multi-step QA datasets.- IRCoT also reduces factual errors in the generated CoTs and works well without training on smaller models like Flan-T5.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating IRCoT, a new interleaved retrieval and reasoning approach for multi-step open-domain QA that can improve performance and reduce factual errors without training, even on smaller models.
