# [Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for   Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10509)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we augment chain-of-thought prompting for open-domain, knowledge-intensive tasks that require complex, multi-step reasoning when the necessary knowledge is either unavailable to the LLM or not up-to-date within its parameters?

The key hypothesis appears to be that a one-step retrieve-and-read approach using question-based retrieval is insufficient for multi-step reasoning QA. Instead, the authors propose an interleaving approach called IRCoT where retrieval is interleaved with chain-of-thought reasoning steps to mutually guide each other.

In summary, the paper aims to address the limitations of one-step question-based retrieval for multi-step open-domain QA by interleaving retrieval with chain-of-thought reasoning steps. The central hypothesis is that this interleaving approach will improve both retrieval and downstream QA performance compared to one-step retrieval methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new approach called IRCoT for multi-step question answering that interleaves retrieval with steps (sentences) in a chain of thought (CoT). The key ideas are:

- Using the CoT to guide retrieval, and using retrieved results to improve the CoT in an interleaved, iterative fashion. 

- This allows retrieving more relevant information for later reasoning steps, compared to standard one-step retrieval using just the question.

- Evaluations using GPT3 show substantial gains from IRCoT in both retrieval (up to 21 points) and downstream QA (up to 15 points) over baseline methods on four multi-step QA datasets.

- IRCoT also reduces factual errors in the generated CoTs and works well without training on smaller models like Flan-T5.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and evaluating IRCoT, a new interleaved retrieval and reasoning approach for multi-step open-domain QA that can improve performance and reduce factual errors without training, even on smaller models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes IRCoT, a new approach for multi-step QA that interleaves retrieval with reasoning steps in a chain-of-thought, using each to guide the other and improve both retrieval and QA performance without training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in multi-step open-domain question answering:

- The main novelty is in using chain-of-thought (CoT) generation to guide retrieval in an interleaved manner, rather than doing one-shot retrieval based only on the question. Other work has explored iterative retrieval, but not in a zero/few-shot setting and without explicitly generating reasoning chains to guide retrieval.

- Compared to other few-shot/zero-shot prompting approaches like SelfAsk, DecomP, and ReAct, this paper shows substantially higher QA performance without requiring model training. Those works also did not focus as much on improving the retrieval process. 

- For supervised approaches, this paper presents a way to achieve multi-step reasoning and retrieval in a zero-shot manner. Supervised methods rely on large training datasets which is not required here.

- The paper shows that by improving the retrieval, they can reduce factual errors in the generated reasoning chains compared to just using the model's parameters. Other prompting works have not analyzed the factual accuracy in this way.

- They demonstrate the effectiveness on large models like GPT-3 as well as smaller models like Flan-T5 without training. Showing it works for smaller models makes the approach more accessible.

- The evaluations are on a diverse set of multi-step reasoning datasets covering different domains and complexity levels. This shows the general applicability of the approach.

Overall, the key novelties are in interleaving CoT generation with retrieval for zero-shot QA, analysis of factual accuracy, and demonstrations on both large and small models. The results significantly advance prompting-based reasoning and retrieval compared to prior works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring strategies to rerank and select the retrieved paragraphs instead of passing all of them to the LM, to alleviate the need for the LM to support long inputs.

- Dynamically deciding when to retrieve more information versus perform more reasoning with current information, to reduce computational cost. 

- Adapting the approach to work well with smaller LMs, since currently it relies on large LMs with strong zero-shot reasoning abilities.

- Improving factuality and reducing hallucination in the generated chains of reasoning.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of open-domain QA datasets and tasks.

- Comparisons to other related methods like ReAct, SelfAsk, DecomP in a controlled head-to-head setting.

- Reducing the need for human-written demonstrations and prompting recipes.

- Integrating external knowledge in a more seamless way during reasoning and retrieval.

In summary, some key directions are improving efficiency, scalability to smaller models, generalizability across tasks, factuality of reasoning chains, and reducing human involvement.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes IRCoT, a new approach for multi-step open-domain question answering that interleaves retrieval with generating steps in a chain of thought (CoT) reasoning process. IRCoT first retrieves documents using the question, then alternates between generating the next sentence in the CoT using the question, retrieved paragraphs, and previous CoT sentences, and retrieving more paragraphs using the last generated CoT sentence. This allows the retrieval to be guided by the ongoing reasoning and vice versa. Experiments using GPT3 on four QA datasets show IRCoT substantially improves retrieval recall and downstream QA accuracy compared to standard one-step retrieval, reduces factual errors in the generated CoTs, and is effective even for much smaller LMs like Flan-T5 without additional training. IRCoT also works well in out-of-distribution settings. The results demonstrate the value of interleaving retrieval with CoT generation for complex, knowledge-intensive open-domain QA.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes IRCoT, a new approach for multi-step question answering that interleaves retrieval with generating steps in a chain of thought (CoT). Large language models can generate natural language reasoning chains when prompted, but struggle when knowledge is unavailable or outdated in their parameters. Using just the question for retrieval helps, but is insufficient for multi-step QA where later retrieval depends on earlier reasoning. IRCoT addresses this by alternating between generating the next reasoning sentence in the CoT and retrieving paragraphs to expand knowledge, letting them guide each other. 

Experiments using IRCoT with GPT3 on 4 QA datasets - HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue and IIRC - substantially improve retrieval recall by 11-21 points and downstream QA F1 by up to 15 points versus one-step retrieval baselines. It reduces factual errors in CoTs by up to 50% and works well for smaller models like Flan-T5 without training. The paper demonstrates the value of interleaved reasoning and retrieval for complex open-domain QA. Overall, IRCoT advances the state of the art for few-shot knowledge-intensive multi-step QA using retrieval-augmented LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes IRCoT, a new approach for multi-step question answering that interleaves retrieval with steps (sentences) in a chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. It starts by retrieving documents using the question as a query. Then it alternates between a reasoning step, where it generates the next sentence in the CoT using the question, retrieved paragraphs, and previously generated CoT sentences, and a retrieval step, where it retrieves more paragraphs using the last generated CoT sentence as the query. This process continues, with reasoning steps guiding retrieval and retrieval guiding reasoning, until the CoT generates an answer or a maximum number of steps is reached. The collected paragraphs are then used as context for a QA model to produce the final answer. By interleaving retrieval and CoT reasoning steps, IRCoT is able to retrieve more relevant information for later reasoning steps compared to standard one-step retrieval using only the question.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problems/questions being addressed in this paper are:

1. Large language models (LLMs) struggle at multi-step question answering when the knowledge required is unavailable in their parameters or out of date. 

2. The standard approach of using the question to do a one-shot retrieval from an external knowledge source is insufficient for complex multi-step reasoning questions.

3. The paper investigates how to augment chain-of-thought prompting for open-domain, knowledge-intensive tasks that require complex multi-step reasoning.

4. Specifically, it proposes an approach called IRCoT that interleaves retrieval steps with chain-of-thought reasoning steps, allowing them to guide each other. 

5. The paper evaluates whether IRCoT can improve retrieval, reduce factual errors in reasoning, and boost overall QA performance compared to one-shot retrieval baselines.

6. It also investigates if IRCoT is effective on both large 175B parameter models like GPT-3 as well as smaller LMs without any training.

So in summary, the key problems are handling knowledge requirements for multi-step QA with LLMs and limitations of one-shot retrieval, which IRCoT aims to address by interleaving retrieval with reasoning steps.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes IRCoT, a novel method that interleaves retrieval and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance on complex, multi-step open-domain QA tasks. The key idea is that for such tasks, retrieval needs to be iterative and guided by reasoning steps, and reasoning needs to leverage retrieved knowledge. IRCoT first retrieves paragraphs using the question, then alternates between generating the next CoT sentence and retrieving paragraphs relevant to that reasoning step. This reciprocally reinforces reasoning and retrieval. Experiments using GPT3 and Flan-T5 on 4 multi-step QA datasets show IRCoT substantially improves retrieval recall and downstream QA accuracy over standard one-step retrieval, reduces factual errors in CoT, and is effective even for much smaller LMs. The gains hold up even in out-of-distribution settings. Without training, IRCoT exceeds recently published results, setting a new state-of-the-art for few-shot prompting on complex open-domain QA.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach called IRCoT for improving retrieval and question answering performance on complex, multi-step reasoning questions. It does so by interleaving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps with retrieval steps in a mutually reinforcing way - using the CoT to guide retrieval and using retrieval to improve the CoT. Specifically, it first retrieves documents using the question, then alternates between generating the next sentence in the reasoning chain based on retrieved info so far, and retrieving more documents conditioned on that reasoning sentence. This iterative process allows later retrieval steps to be more focused compared to one-shot retrieval with the question. Experiments on 4 multi-hop QA datasets show IRCoT significantly improves retrieval recall and downstream QA accuracy compared to baseline one-shot retrieval, for both large LLMs like GPT-3 and smaller models like Flan-T5. It also reduces factual errors in the generated reasoning chains. The gains hold up even when transferring demonstrations from one dataset to test on another (out-of-distribution setting).
