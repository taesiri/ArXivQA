# [Using Generative Text Models to Create Qualitative Codebooks for Student   Evaluations of Teaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11984)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Student evaluations of teaching (SETs) provide important feedback for instructors and administrators. However, analyzing large volumes of textual SET data is time-consuming and challenging. This prevents institutions from fully utilizing the insights from student feedback. There is a need for efficient methods to analyze large SET datasets.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel natural language processing (NLP) method to automatically generate a qualitative codebook from SET data. The method involves:

1) Extracting the key ideas from thousands of SET responses using a text generation model. 
2) Representing those ideas as vectors using semantic text embeddings.  
3) Clustering the vectors to group similar ideas.
4) Summarizing each cluster into a code using another text generation model.

This results in a codebook with concise labels, definitions and examples for the main themes in the SET data. The authors test this on 5000 SET responses and produce a 159-code codebook. They show that it captures similar themes to a manually generated codebook from a subset of the same data.

Main Contributions:

- A scalable NLP workflow (extract, embed, cluster, summarize) to inductively generate a qualitative codebook from textual data

- Demonstrates the workflow on a dataset of 5000 SET responses, automatically producing a detailed 159-code codebook  

- Codebook covers comparable themes to a manually generated codebook, showing the method replicates human qualitative analysis  

- Suggests applications beyond SETs for analyzing documents like student writing, research papers, interview transcripts  

- Proposes an efficient way to extract insights from textual data to overcome challenges of scale using modern NLP techniques

The paper introduces an innovative methodology leveraging AI to automate qualitative analysis, making it more scalable. This enables institutions to better utilize extensive textual feedback data.
