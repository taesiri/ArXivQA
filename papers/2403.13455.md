# [FACT: Fast and Active Coordinate Initialization for Vision-based Drone   Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13455)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Swarm robot systems need accurate relative pose estimation between robots for collaborative tasks. However, this is challenging with only onboard sensors on small drones due to limited field-of-view (FoV), anonymous measurements between drones, and safety concerns.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a complete vision-based system called FACT to address these challenges and achieve fast and robust coordinate initialization.

- To handle limited FoV, drones rotate in place for observations from different orientations. A lightweight neural network called DG-VDT is used for drone detection in images.

- For anonymous measurements, the problem is divided into rotation and translation estimation. The rotation estimation is formulated as a semi-definite programming problem to obtain the global optimal solution. The translation and correspondence problem uses Hungarian algorithm.  

- For safety and complete observations, an active planning strategy selects positions for next observations and plans trajectories avoiding collisions.

Main Contributions:
- A full system integrating observation, estimation, and planning for vision-based swarm coordinate initialization with only onboard sensors.

- A method to transform the non-convex rotation estimation into a convex semi-definite programming problem to achieve global optimization.

- Experiments in simulation and real-world with drones validate the system, showing superior accuracy and speed compared to local optimization methods, even with noise and partial observations.

In summary, the paper presents a complete solution FACT to enable fast, accurate and robust relative pose estimation for drone swarms using only onboard vision sensors, overcoming limitations like FoV and anonymous measurements. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.
