# [Query Augmentation by Decoding Semantics from Brain Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15708)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional query augmentation relies on extracting information from initially retrieved documents, which can be limited if those documents are of low quality. There is increasing research showing brain signals can be used to understand users' search intentions, but it has not been explored for directly augmenting queries.

Proposed Solution - Brain-Aug:
The paper proposes directly refining queries by incorporating semantic information decoded from users' brain signals. It uses two techniques:

1) Prompt construction with brain signals: Brain signals are decoded into the language model's latent space to construct prompts that integrate textual and brain information.

2) Training based on next token prediction and ranking-oriented inference: The model is trained to predict tokens in relevant documents as query continuations. Ranking-oriented features like IDF are used during inference to generate continuations that distinguish documents.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes Brain-Aug to directly augment queries using brain signals, without reliance on document quality.
- Demonstrates Brain-Aug can accurately expand queries and improve document ranking, especially for ambiguous queries.  
- Opens opportunities for new methods that understand users by decoding semantics from brain signals as a natural part of users perceiving information.

In summary, the key innovation is using brain signals to directly refine queries instead of just predicting relevance, enabled by prompt construction and training techniques. The results show brain signals provide useful semantics for augmentation and improve ranking.
