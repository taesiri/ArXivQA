# [SemTra: A Semantic Skill Translator for Cross-Domain Zero-Shot Policy   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07418)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper explores the challenging problem of cross-domain zero-shot policy adaptation for long-horizon tasks, where a multi-modal user input can prompt complex behaviors for different domains. 
- Achieving robust adaptation across domains without additional data collection or fine-tuning remains difficult, especially for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Proposed Solution - SemTra Framework:
- Presents a novel semantic skill translator (SemTra) framework that leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to interpret user inputs and adapt policies to new domains.

- Uses a two-tiered hierarchical adaptation approach:
   1) Task-level: Translates user input to target domain skills using PLMs 
   2) Skill-level: Disentangles skills from domain contexts and optimizes each skill through parametric instantiation

- Key Components:
   - Multi-modal encoders to extract skills
   - PLM-based decoder for task-level translation 
   - Context encoders to capture domain factors 
   - Behavior decoder conditioned on skills and context

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new SemTra framework for complex cross-domain policy adaptation through semantic skill translation
- Proposes a hierarchical approach with task and skill-level optimization using PLMs
- Evaluated extensively on Meta-World, Franka Kitchen, RLBench and CARLA showing superior adaptation capabilities 
- Demonstrates applicability for cognitive robots interpreting instructions and autonomous vehicles operating under varied configurations
- Overall, the first unified framework to tackle multi-modal inputs for policy adaptation across diverse domains without additional data or fine-tuning
