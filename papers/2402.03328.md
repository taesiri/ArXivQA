# [Large-scale Generative AI Models Lack Visual Number Sense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates whether state-of-the-art AI models can reliably judge the number of objects (numerosity) in visual scenes, which is an intuitive capability in humans and many animal species. Even infants are sensitive to numerosity, suggesting it is a foundational numerical ability that emerges before formal education.

Approach: 
The authors systematically tested the visual number sense of advanced generative AI systems using two key behavioral tasks - numerosity naming (stating the number of objects in an image) and numerosity production (generating images with a target number of objects). The models tested include transformer-based vision-language models (ViLT, BLIP-2) for naming, and text-to-image generation models (DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion 2.1) for production. Numerosity judgments were tested in the range of 1-10 items from five object categories (apples, people, butterflies, dots, abstract shapes).

Key Findings:
1) The models showed very low accuracy in numerosity naming (ViLT 28%, BLIP-2 30%) and production (DALL-E 39%, Stable Diffusion 33%), even for small numbers of items. This demonstrates they lack basic counting abilities and would be classified as 2-3 year old "knowers".

2) There was no evidence the models form abstract numerical representations - their responses drastically varied between object categories. 

3) The pattern of errors did not systematically follow Weber's law of scalar variability as found in human/animal numerical cognition. 

Main Conclusions:  
The study reveals a striking failure of advanced AI systems to understand basic visual numerosity. It highlights a key limitation in their higher-level reasoning abilities. The authors argue substantial progress in architecture design is needed to enable AI systems to properly acquire basic numerical and mathematical knowledge.
