# [VideoGLUE: Video General Understanding Evaluation of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03166)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: How do existing foundation models (FMs) perform on video understanding tasks compared to specialized video models? More specifically, the authors evaluate six representative FMs on three video tasks - action recognition, temporal localization, and spatiotemporal localization, using eight datasets and four adaptation methods. The key hypotheses they test are:1) Existing FMs still underperform specialized video models on these tasks, unlike the superiority FMs have shown on language and image tasks. This suggests the need for better video-focused FMs.2) Video-native FMs outperform image-native FMs on motion-rich videos and temporal/spatiotemporal reasoning, likely because of video data in pretraining.3) Light adaptation (e.g. frozen backbones) benefit video-native FMs more than full finetuning, while image-native FMs excel at full finetuning. This highlights the importance of both tasks and adaptation methods in FM evaluation.In summary, the central research question is assessing how current generalist FMs perform on specialized video understanding tasks compared to state-of-the-art specialized models. The key hypotheses examine if video-native pretraining and choice of adaptation impact FM performance on motion-rich video tasks.
