## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Real-world food detection faces challenges in detecting novel food classes. Conventional food detectors trained on fixed seen classes fail to recognize new unseen food categories. To address this, the paper benchmarks the task of Zero-Shot Food Detection (ZSFD) to enable detection of novel unseen food objects without requiring labeled data of new classes. However, ZSFD faces issues like inter-class similarity and complex food attributes, making it difficult to synthesize discriminative features to distinguish fine-grained food classes.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a ZSFD framework called ZSFDet with two main components - Knowledge-Enhanced Feature Synthesizer (KEFS) and an object detection module. KEFS contains:

1) Multi-Source Graph Fusion (MSGF): Fuses multi-source graph embeddings from knowledge graph, hyperclass graph and probability graph to learn knowledge representations capturing correlations between food categories and complex attributes. 

2) Region Feature Diffusion Model (RFDM): A diffusion model based generator that produces diverse and realistic region features for unseen classes by reversing the additive noise process, conditioned on knowledge representations from MSGF.

Together, KEFS generates discriminative unseen features to train robust ZSFD. The detection module is first trained on seen classes, then updated with parameters from unseen classifier trained on synthesized features.

Main Contributions:

1) Benchmarks ZSFD task and introduces dataset FOWA with rich bounding box and attribute annotations to facilitate ZSFD research.

2) Proposes ZSFDet framework to address inter-class similarity and complex attributes via knowledge-enhanced feature synthesis using multi-source semantic knowledge.

3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ZSFD datasets FOWA and UECFOOD-256. Also shows effectiveness on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO for general zero-shot detection.
