# [Efficient Transformers: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we make Transformers more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational complexity, particularly with regards to the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism?

The paper surveys and categorizes the various techniques that have been proposed for developing more efficient Transformer models, focusing especially on innovations related to the self-attention mechanism. It provides a taxonomy of models based on their approach, such as using fixed patterns, combinations of patterns, learnable patterns, memory, low-rank methods, kernels, recurrence, downsampling, and sparsity. 

The main hypothesis seems to be that there are a variety of ways to improve Transformer efficiency, many of which have shown promise on certain tasks or domains. However, there is still a lack of clarity on which fundamental efficient Transformer block performs the best across different scenarios. The paper aims to provide a structured overview of the landscape of efficient Transformer techniques to help researchers understand the state of the field.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on efficient Transformers:

- It provides a broad taxonomy and overview of many recent efficient Transformer models across domains like NLP and computer vision. This makes it a fairly comprehensive survey of techniques for improving Transformer efficiency. Many previous papers focus on proposing a new efficient Transformer variant, without reviewing the wider landscape.

- The paper categorizes efficient Transformer techniques into groups like fixed patterns, combination of patterns, learnable patterns, low-rank methods, kernels, recurrence, downsampling, and sparse models. This high-level abstraction offers a useful way to conceptualize the different approaches.

- It gives a detailed walkthrough of many influential efficient Transformer models, explaining their core ideas and tradeoffs. This provides good background on seminal works like Sparse Transformers, Performers, Linformers, etc.

- The paper discusses evaluation practices and analyzes some trends in model design over time. It provides retrospective thoughts on how the field has evolved and future directions. This meta-level commentary is less common in research papers.

- Compared to some other surveys, this paper spans both NLP and vision domains in its coverage of efficient Transformers. Many models were proposed separately in NLP and CV communities, so reviewing both areas is useful.

- The scope goes beyond self-attention to also mention orthogonal efficiency efforts like weight sharing, distillation, NAS, etc. This gives a more complete picture of the topic.

In summary, this paper delivers an extensive survey and analysis of recent efficient Transformers, covering key techniques, models, and trends across NLP and CV in more depth than most prior works on this topic. The taxonomy, detailed walkthroughs, and discussion offer significant value to researchers in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Developing standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols to enable easier comparison and assessment of different efficient Transformer models. The current lack of unified evaluation makes it challenging to determine the relative strengths of different models.

- Continuing to explore combinatorial approaches, such as models that incorporate multiple techniques like downsampling and low-rank approximations. The authors point out that recent models are starting to combine methods, and this may be a promising direction.

- Designing models where efficiency is "baked in" from the start, rather than as an afterthought or side model. The ideal efficient Transformer would have efficiency and scalability as core design principles.

- Considering whether the "true" efficient Transformer will still rely on attention mechanisms, or explore alternate architectures. The authors wonder if future breakthroughs may come from outside the attention paradigm.

- Developing models that retain universality and perform well across diverse tasks, not just specialized long-range tasks. Avoiding tradeoffs in speed, memory, and task flexibility.

- Simplifying model designs and implementations so efficient Transformers are easy drop-in replacements, without excessive engineering.

- Exploring how techniques like sparsity and conditional computation can improve efficiency beyond just the attention modules. 

- Evaluating new models under pretraining and fine-tuning, not just standalone benchmarks, for a robust test.

In summary, the authors emphasize the need for standardized evaluation, continued exploration of hybrid techniques, simplified and universal architectures, and testing models under realistic training regimes as key future directions for efficient Transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the Sinkhorn Transformer, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention to linear. It partitions the input sequence into fixed size blocks and sorts the keys and values within each block using a learned soft sorting network based on Sinkhorn iterations. This allows the model to rearrange keys and values to reflect relevance while still enabling block-wise attention patterns for efficiency. During training, it applies an autoencoding loss to reconstruct the sorted sequences, acting as a regularization to prevent trivial solutions. Experiments demonstrate the Sinkhorn Transformer achieves competitive performance on generative and discriminative language tasks while requiring less memory than full attention Transformers. Overall, it provides an efficient attention mechanism through learned block-wise sorting of keys and values.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a survey of efficient Transformer models for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Transformers have become ubiquitous in deep learning, but their self-attention mechanism has quadratic complexity which hinders scalability. Recently, many "X-former" models have been proposed to improve the efficiency of Transformers. The paper categorizes these models into groups: fixed patterns, combination of patterns, neural memory, learnable patterns, low rank methods, kernels, recurrence, downsampling, and sparse models. It provides a detailed walkthrough of key models in each category, analyzing techniques like compressed attention, axial attention, global memory tokens, routing transformers, linear transformers, and mixture of experts layers. The paper also discusses evaluation of efficient Transformers, noting challenges in benchmarking due to differing evaluation metrics and task domains. It observes design trends starting with simple fixed patterns and progressing to more complex methods combining techniques. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions like standardized benchmarks, designing elegance into next-generation Transformers, and determining if the ideal efficient Transformer will still be a Transformer. Overall, the paper delivers a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of recent work on efficient Transformers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient transformer architecture that reduces the quadratic complexity of self-attention. It does so by using a combination of fixed sparse attention patterns (local and strided windows) and additional global memory tokens. Specifically, the model splits the self-attention heads into two types - some heads use a fixed local window to only compute attention within a small neighborhood, reducing complexity from O(N^2) to O(N). The other heads use a fixed strided pattern to attend to a sparse subset of tokens. In addition, the model introduces a small number of global memory tokens that have access to the entire sequence context. Attention scores are computed between normal tokens and these memory tokens to efficiently incorporate global information. The combination of fixed sparse patterns and global memory tokens allows the model to handle much longer sequences while remaining efficient in memory and computation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper appears to be providing a survey and taxonomy of "efficient Transformer" models. The main problem it seems to be addressing is the quadratic complexity of the standard Transformer self-attention mechanism, which can make it difficult to apply Transformers to very long sequences. 

The key points I gathered are:

- The standard Transformer self-attention operation has quadratic complexity in the sequence length. This restricts its applicability for very long sequences.

- Many recent works have proposed "efficient Transformer" variants to reduce this complexity and enable Transformers to better handle long sequences. 

- This paper categorizes and surveys these models, providing a taxonomy based on their core techniques:
  - Fixed patterns (local, strided, compressed attention)
  - Combinations of patterns 
  - Neural memory modules
  - Low rank approximations
  - Kernel methods
  - Recurrence
  - Downsampling
  - Sparse models

- The paper walks through details and tradeoffs of prominent models in each category.

- It discusses evaluation challenges and design trends in this space. 

- The paper concludes by reflecting on progress in the past year, and pondering future research directions towards finding an ideal efficient Transformer model.

In summary, this paper aims to provide a broad survey and taxonomy of the quickly evolving landscape of efficient Transformer variants, to help researchers understand techniques and tradeoffs in this area.
