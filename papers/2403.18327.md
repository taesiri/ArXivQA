# [Can LLMs Converse Formally? Automatically Assessing LLMs in Translating   and Interpreting Formal Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Stakeholders often describe system requirements informally using natural language (NL). These are then manually converted to formal specifications by domain experts, which is costly. 
- Existing methods to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on formal specification translation have limitations around quality/scale of datasets, bidirectional translation assessment, and truth maintenance.

Proposed Solution:
- Present an automated approach to evaluate LLMs on formal syntax translation without human involvement. 
- Generate scalable datasets with formal syntax grammars that have adjustable complexity.
- Use two copies of an LLM for bidirectional translation between NL and formal syntax. 
- Assess translation accuracy using off-the-shelf verifiers to check equivalence rather than exact syntactic match.

Key Contributions:
1) Method to automatically generate test datasets using grammars for formal languages like propositional logic.
2) Hands-free approach for bidirectional LLM assessment on NL<>formal syntax translation. 
3) Empirical evaluation showing current LLMs still lack adequate performance even on simple SAT and FOL specifications.

In summary, the paper proposes and demonstrates an automated technique to evaluate how well LLMs can translate between natural language and formal specifications in both directions, using dataset generation and equivalence checking instead of human annotation. Initial results indicate significant room for improvement in LLM performance on this task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an automatic approach to assess the capabilities of large language models in translating between natural language and formal logic specifications, showing that state-of-the-art models still lack adequate performance even on simple tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an automatic, hands-free approach to assess the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in translating between natural language and formal specifications without requiring any additional human input. 

Specifically, the key contributions highlighted in the paper are:

1) Proposing the generation of scalable datasets using formal syntax grammars to automatically create test cases that can be categorized by complexity.

2) Putting forth an automatic evaluation methodology utilizing two copies of an LLM and off-the-shelf verifiers to assess the translation accuracy in both directions (natural language to formal syntax and vice versa) without human intervention. 

3) Conducting an empirical study to demonstrate that current state-of-the-art LLMs are still lacking in adequately solving this translation task, even for simple specifications such as propositional and first-order logic.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a completely automated technique to evaluate LLMs on formal specification translation without needing manual verification.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an automated approach to assess the capabilities of LLMs in translating between natural language and formal specifications. How does this approach specifically allow evaluating both natural language to formal specification (NL->FS) and formal specification to natural language (FS->NL) capabilities?

2. The paper utilizes two copies of the same LLM in its evaluation approach to avoid contextual knowledge transfer. Why is avoiding contextual knowledge transfer important in assessing the standalone capabilities of an LLM?

3. The paper generates datasets using grammars of formal languages like propositional logic. In what ways does this approach for dataset creation have advantages over using human-annotated datasets?

4. The CNF formula generator used in the experiments can control the difficulty of generated formulas by varying parameters like clause density. How can controlling such parameters lead to more rigorous testing of LLM capabilities?

5. The prompts play a critical role in eliciting the desired behavior from LLMs. How did the authors design and refine prompts to ensure the LLMs perform formal syntax translation and interpretation appropriately?

6. What were some of the common issues faced by LLMs in translating CNF formulas to natural language descriptions, as noted in the results? How may these issues limit the application of LLMs for such tasks?

7. Why would inclusion of additional logical operators like implication make the first order logic formulas more challenging for LLMs to translate even when number of overall operators are kept the same?

8. How might the human interpretability of formulas in terms of predicates and constants familiar in natural language affect the capability of LLMs in translating them?

9. The paper compares capabilities across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. What common issues did these LLMs face in translating between formal logic and natural language?

10. The results demonstrate current limitations of LLMs on formal translation tasks. What are some promising future research directions suggested that could address these limitations?
