# [YOLO-Former: YOLO Shakes Hand With ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Object detection is an important computer vision task with applications like automated driving systems, robotics, etc. Prior work like R-CNN, SSD and YOLO make tradeoffs between accuracy and inference speed. This paper aims to improve upon the YOLOv4 object detector by incorporating transformer-based attention to achieve higher accuracy while retaining real-time performance.

Methods:
The authors propose YOLO-Former, which integrates convolutional self-attention modules into the YOLOv4 architecture. Specifically, they replace some residual blocks in YOLOv4 with convolutional transformer modules. These modules apply convolutional self-attention based on scaled dot product attention used in transformers. Several variants of the self-attention module are evaluated like single-head, multi-branch, and multi-head attention.

The model is trained on Pascal VOC dataset augmented with COCO images, using extensive data augmentation like RandAugment, cutout, mosaic augmentation etc. Additional regularization techniques like scheduled dropblock and shake-shake regularization are also utilized.

Results: 
YOLO-Former achieves state-of-the-art 85.76% mAP on Pascal VOC test set, outperforming YOLOv4 (83.75% mAP), while maintaining high speeds (10.85 FPS). The multi-head multi-branch attention variant performs best with 86.01% mAP. So the integration of convolutional self-attention helps improve accuracy over YOLOv4.

Conclusion:
The paper demonstrates how combining ideas from YOLO and transformers can lead to better object detectors. The proposed YOLO-Former module is shown to enhance YOLOv4 accuracy on Pascal VOC while retaining real-time performance. The core contribution lies in design and evaluation of the convolutional self-attention module integrated into the YOLO architecture.
