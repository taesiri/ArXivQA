## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is critical for effective analysis and interpretation of hyperspectral data. However, simultaneously modeling global and local features is rarely explored to enhance HSI denoising.
- Two main challenges: 1) Finding the optimal hybrid architecture to model both global and local features; 2) Improving the single-scale feature aggregation limitation of the feed-forward network (FFN) in Transformer.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Hybrid Convolution and Attention Network (HCANet) that leverages strengths of both CNNs and Transformers for HSI denoising.

Key Contributions:
- Design a convolution and attention fusion module (CAFM) to capture long-range dependencies and neighborhood spectral correlations to enhance modeling of global and local features.
- Propose a multi-scale feed-forward network (MSFN) to improve multi-scale information aggregation and extract features at different scales to enhance denoising.
- Experiments on benchmark HSI datasets show HCANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Effectively removes various types of noise while preserving details.
- First work to combine convolution and attention for HSI denoising task. Provides optimal hybrid architecture to model global and local features. Improves feature aggregation through MSFN.

In summary, the paper explores the problem of simultaneously modeling global and local features for enhanced HSI denoising. A hybrid convolution and attention network (HCANet) is proposed leveraging CNNs and Transformers. The convolution and attention fusion module and multi-scale feed-forward network allow optimal modeling of global and local features and multi-scale feature aggregation. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in removing complex noise while preserving details.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hybrid convolution and attention network (HCANet) for hyperspectral image denoising that fuses global and local features through a convolution and attention fusion module and extracts multi-scale features through a multi-scale feed-forward network to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a hybrid convolution and attention network (HCANet) for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising, which combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers to simultaneously model both global and local features. 

2) It designs a convolution and attention fusion module (CAFM) to capture both long-range dependencies via attention and neighborhood spectral correlations via convolution.

3) It proposes a multi-scale feed-forward network (MSFN) to improve multi-scale feature aggregation and enhance denoising performance.

4) Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HCANet, outperforming state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

In summary, the key innovation is the hybrid convolution and attention architecture to effectively fuse global and local contexts for enhanced HSI denoising, outperforming previous CNN-only or Transformer-only approaches. The proposed ideas of CAFM and MSFN also contribute to improved performance.
