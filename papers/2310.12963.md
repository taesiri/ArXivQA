# [AutoMix: Automatically Mixing Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12963)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: 

\textit{How can we strategically combine different sized language models in a resource-efficient manner to optimize the tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost?}

In particular, the authors propose an approach called AutoMix which automatically routes queries to larger language models only when necessary, based on an initial verification of the output from a smaller model. The key ideas are:

- Using a smaller "base" language model (SLM) for initial generation to minimize cost

- Employing few-shot learning to self-verify the SLM's output without separate training 

- Introducing a "meta-verifier" to refine noisy verification and decide if rerouting to a larger model is warranted

- Optimizing the tradeoff between accuracy gains and computational costs when mixing models of different sizes 

The central hypothesis seems to be that by intelligently switching between different sized models based on few-shot self-verification and meta-verification, AutoMix can outperform strategies that use a single model size for all queries. The authors test this on several context-based reasoning tasks using SLM/LLM pairs.

In summary, the key research question is how to efficiently combine models of different capabilities by routing queries where larger models provide sufficient accuracy gains to justify their additional computational expense. AutoMix is proposed as an approach to address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces AutoMix, a method for strategically mixing different sized language models to optimize the trade-off between computational cost and performance. The key ideas and contributions are:

- AutoMix uses only black-box access to language model APIs, avoiding the need for access to gradients, logits, or model weights. It relies on few-shot learning and meta-verification.

- It introduces a context-grounded few-shot self-verification method to estimate reliability of a small model's outputs without labeled training data. 

- A meta-verifier is proposed to handle potential noise in the few-shot self-verification judgments. This meta-verifier can use techniques like thresholding or POMDPs.

- A new metric called Incremental Benefit Per Unit Cost (IBUC) is proposed to evaluate efficiency of mixing different sized models. 

- Experiments on 5 context-grounded reasoning datasets demonstrate that AutoMix outperforms baselines, improving IBUC by up to 89% using a POMDP-based meta-verifier.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective method to mix black-box language model APIs using few-shot learning and meta-verification to optimize the cost-performance tradeoff. The introduction of metrics like IBUC and techniques like context-grounded self-verification are also notable contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces AutoMix, a method to optimize cost and performance when using black-box language model APIs by strategically routing queries to larger models based on self-verification and meta-verification scores.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- Novelty of approach: This paper presents a new method/framework/model called AutoMix that strategically combines different sized language models to optimize cost and performance. This is a novel approach compared to most prior work that focuses on using a single model. 

- Leveraging black box APIs: The AutoMix method is designed to work with black box language model APIs, rather than requiring access to model weights or gradients. This makes it more practical for real-world application with commercial APIs.

- Use of few-shot learning: AutoMix relies on few-shot learning for the solution generation and verification steps, avoiding the need for task-specific training. This contrasts with some related work that trains specialized models.

- Meta-verifier for noisy self-verification: A key contribution is the meta-verifier, which adds a secondary check to handle potential noise in the self-verification process. Other methods generally trust the self-verification outputs directly.

- Focus on longer reasoning tasks: AutoMix is evaluated on question answering datasets that involve reasoning over longer contexts like stories and articles. Much prior work has focused more on shorter inputs.

- Novel cost-performance metric: The paper introduces a new efficiency metric called Incremental Benefit per Cost that accounts for both accuracy gains and computational expenses.

Overall, AutoMix introduces a novel model-routing framework tailored to leveraging black box LLMs through few-shot learning and robust meta-verification. The experiments on reasoning tasks over long contexts also represent a unique evaluation setting.
