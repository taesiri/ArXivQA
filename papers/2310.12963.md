# [AutoMix: Automatically Mixing Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12963)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be: 

\textit{How can we strategically combine different sized language models in a resource-efficient manner to optimize the tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost?}

In particular, the authors propose an approach called AutoMix which automatically routes queries to larger language models only when necessary, based on an initial verification of the output from a smaller model. The key ideas are:

- Using a smaller "base" language model (SLM) for initial generation to minimize cost

- Employing few-shot learning to self-verify the SLM's output without separate training 

- Introducing a "meta-verifier" to refine noisy verification and decide if rerouting to a larger model is warranted

- Optimizing the tradeoff between accuracy gains and computational costs when mixing models of different sizes 

The central hypothesis seems to be that by intelligently switching between different sized models based on few-shot self-verification and meta-verification, AutoMix can outperform strategies that use a single model size for all queries. The authors test this on several context-based reasoning tasks using SLM/LLM pairs.

In summary, the key research question is how to efficiently combine models of different capabilities by routing queries where larger models provide sufficient accuracy gains to justify their additional computational expense. AutoMix is proposed as an approach to address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces AutoMix, a method for strategically mixing different sized language models to optimize the trade-off between computational cost and performance. The key ideas and contributions are:

- AutoMix uses only black-box access to language model APIs, avoiding the need for access to gradients, logits, or model weights. It relies on few-shot learning and meta-verification.

- It introduces a context-grounded few-shot self-verification method to estimate reliability of a small model's outputs without labeled training data. 

- A meta-verifier is proposed to handle potential noise in the few-shot self-verification judgments. This meta-verifier can use techniques like thresholding or POMDPs.

- A new metric called Incremental Benefit Per Unit Cost (IBUC) is proposed to evaluate efficiency of mixing different sized models. 

- Experiments on 5 context-grounded reasoning datasets demonstrate that AutoMix outperforms baselines, improving IBUC by up to 89% using a POMDP-based meta-verifier.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective method to mix black-box language model APIs using few-shot learning and meta-verification to optimize the cost-performance tradeoff. The introduction of metrics like IBUC and techniques like context-grounded self-verification are also notable contributions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- Novelty of approach: This paper presents a new method/framework/model called AutoMix that strategically combines different sized language models to optimize cost and performance. This is a novel approach compared to most prior work that focuses on using a single model. 

- Leveraging black box APIs: The AutoMix method is designed to work with black box language model APIs, rather than requiring access to model weights or gradients. This makes it more practical for real-world application with commercial APIs.

- Use of few-shot learning: AutoMix relies on few-shot learning for the solution generation and verification steps, avoiding the need for task-specific training. This contrasts with some related work that trains specialized models.

- Meta-verifier for noisy self-verification: A key contribution is the meta-verifier, which adds a secondary check to handle potential noise in the self-verification process. Other methods generally trust the self-verification outputs directly.

- Focus on longer reasoning tasks: AutoMix is evaluated on question answering datasets that involve reasoning over longer contexts like stories and articles. Much prior work has focused more on shorter inputs.

- Novel cost-performance metric: The paper introduces a new efficiency metric called Incremental Benefit per Cost that accounts for both accuracy gains and computational expenses.

Overall, AutoMix introduces a novel model-routing framework tailored to leveraging black box LLMs through few-shot learning and robust meta-verification. The experiments on reasoning tasks over long contexts also represent a unique evaluation setting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different model architectures and training techniques for the verifier module, such as supervised learning or reinforcement learning approaches. The authors mention that the simple threshold-based meta-verifier can likely be improved.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of language models and task types beyond the settings studied in the paper. The authors suggest applying AutoMix to model pairs of varying scale beyond just small and large models. 

- Extending AutoMix to settings with more than two language models. The current work focuses on routing between a small and large model, but the authors propose expanding this to incorporate multiple model sizes.

- Applying AutoMix in streaming settings across sequences of queries, rather than just single queries. The POMDP framework used for meta-verification can handle sequential decisions.

- Combining AutoMix with other techniques like prompt engineering to further boost the performance of the verifier module. The impact of task-specific prompts on verification is analyzed.

- Exploring different cost metrics beyond the pricing model used. The cost calculation could be enhanced to account for various complexities in model inference.

- Analysis of AutoMix behavior and performance across a broader range of language tasks. The paper analyzes results on question answering datasets.

In summary, key directions are: improvements to the verifier and meta-verifier components, expanding AutoMix to new models and tasks, applying the approach in streaming or conversational settings, integrating prompt engineering, and using more advanced cost modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents AutoMix, an approach for strategically routing queries to large language models (LLMs) of different sizes in order to optimize the trade-off between computational cost and performance. AutoMix uses a smaller, low-cost LLM to generate an initial answer to a query. It then employs few-shot learning to self-verify the accuracy of this initial answer based on its consistency with the provided context, without requiring training data. To account for potential noise in the self-verification, AutoMix applies a meta-verifier module to refine the reliability assessment of the verification and determine whether to accept the initial answer or route the query to a larger, more accurate yet costly LLM. Experiments using the LLAMAS language model pair on five reasoning datasets demonstrate that AutoMix outperforms baselines by enhancing the incremental benefit per cost by up to 89%. The method provides an effective strategy for leveraging black-box LLM APIs by circumventing the need for separate models or access to logits. AutoMix also introduces the notion of "unsolvable" queries that are unlikely to be addressed even by large models, allowing it to judiciously allocate resources. Overall, the work demonstrates the promise of few-shot self-verification and meta-verification techniques for improving LLMs at inference time.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces AutoMix, a method for strategically routing queries to large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes in order to optimize performance and cost. AutoMix utilizes a smaller, low-cost LLM to generate initial answers to queries. These preliminary answers are then self-verified by prompting the smaller LLM to check if the answer aligns with the provided context. To account for potential noise in the self-verification, AutoMix employs a meta-verifier, implemented as either a confidence threshold or a POMDP, to vet the verifier's conclusions. Based on the meta-verifier's assessment, the query is either returned with the smaller LLM's answer or routed to a larger, more accurate yet expensive LLM. 

The paper evaluates AutoMix on five context-grounded reasoning datasets using smaller and larger LLaMA models. The results demonstrate that AutoMix outperforms baselines like FrugalGPT in terms of the proposed Incremental Benefit Per Unit Cost metric. AutoMix enhances the efficiency of performance gains relative to cost increases by up to 89% over just using the larger model for all queries. The analysis shows the few-shot self-verification can effectively leverage context for consistency checking, and the meta-verifier boosts robustness. Overall, AutoMix provides an effective approach to optimize cost and accuracy trade-offs when using black-box access to LLM APIs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes AutoMix, an approach to strategically route queries to larger language models (LLMs) based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LLM. Central to AutoMix is a few-shot self-verification mechanism, where the smaller LLM prompts itself to assess the reliability of its own outputs without requiring training. However, recognizing that self-verification can be inconsistent, AutoMix employs a meta-verifier to refine the accuracy of these assessments. Specifically, it formulates the meta-verification as a POMDP that learns to balance performance gains against computational costs based on validation set statistics. During inference, if the meta-verifier deems the smaller LLM's output reliable, it is returned. Otherwise, the query is routed to the larger LLM to enhance accuracy. Experiments using LLaMa2-13b and LLaMa2-70b on five reasoning datasets show AutoMix improves cost-efficiency, measured via a proposed metric called Incremental Benefit Per Cost, over baselines by up to 89%.
