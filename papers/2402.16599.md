# [Resolution-Agnostic Neural Compression for High-Fidelity Portrait Video   Conferencing via Implicit Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video conferencing demands high fidelity and extremely low bandwidth, but most classic video compression methods cannot achieve this. 
- Recent neural compression works use 2D image warping which fails with large motions and lacks support for high resolutions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a neural compression framework using implicit 3D neural radiance fields (NeRF) to reconstruct high-fidelity talking heads.
- Extract facial expression features and pose using 3D Morphable Face Models at sender side.
- Further compress features using entropy coding before transmitting over network.  
- At receiver, use features to drive NeRF-based face reconstruction model built on AD-NeRF to render photo-realistic portraits.

Key Outcomes:
- Achieves ultra low bandwidth video conferencing through feature substitution while maintaining high visual quality.  
- NeRF representation ensures robustness to pose changes compared to 2D warping approaches.
- Framework is resolution-agnostic - low bandwidth independent of video resolution.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in rate-distortion performance.
- Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate high fidelity facial reconstruction at extremely low bitrates.

Main Contributions:
- First work to apply NeRF for neural video compression and conferencing.
- Complete system design from sender to receiver end for NeRF video compression.
- Resolution-agnostic compression with implicit Neural Radiance Fields.
- Fine-tuned feature embedding for improved compression rate.
- State-of-the-art rate-distortion performance demonstrated through comparisons.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel NeRF-based approach for model-driven video conferencing that can achieve extremely low bandwidth while preserving visual quality through controllable 3D facial reconstruction.
