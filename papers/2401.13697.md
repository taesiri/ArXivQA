# [Toward Robust Multimodal Learning using Multimodal Foundational Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13697)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal learning models rely on the assumption of complete multimodal data during training and testing. However, in real-world scenarios, modalities are often incomplete or missing. 
- Methods like cross-modal reconstruction perform poorly due to misaligned semantic spaces across modalities. 
- Recently proposed multimodal foundation models (like CLIP) learn aligned semantic spaces but cannot handle missing modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose TRML, a robust multimodal learning framework that enhances multimodal foundation models to address missing modalities.

- It has three main components:
   1) Multimodal Foundation Model (MFM) that learns latent cross-modal semantics
   2) Missing Modality Inference module that generates virtual modalities to replace missing ones
   3) Semantic Matching module that aligns semantic spaces of original and virtual modalities

- For a missing modality, the corresponding virtual modality is generated using the prompt of available modalities. 

- The semantic matching loss aligns original and virtual modalities to ensure generated modalities capture semantics of missing ones.

- Virtual modalities replace missing ones during training and inference.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework to enhance robustness of multimodal foundation models for missing modalities
- Tailored missing modality inference and semantic matching modules
- Aligns semantic spaces of original and virtual (generated) modalities
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets
- Qualitative analysis shows generated modalities capture semantics of missing ones

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to handle missing modalities in multimodal learning by enhancing robustness of foundation models via modality generation and semantic alignment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multimodal learning framework called TRML that extends clip-based multimodal foundation models to handle missing modalities during training and inference by generating virtual modalities through cross-modal semantic alignment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Designing a simple yet robust multimodal learning framework that extends the capabilities of multimodal foundation models to handle missing modalities by utilizing latent semantic associations to enhance robustness. 

2. Designing a missing modality inference module to generate virtual visual/text modalities, and a semantic matching learning module to align the semantic spaces of virtual and original modalities. This ensures the virtual modalities can learn the semantics of missing modalities.

3. Achieving superior performance compared to previous works on three multimodal sentiment analysis benchmark datasets - CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD. The model can also handle missing modalities at the frame level, which existing models cannot.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework to enhance the robustness of multimodal foundation models like CLIP to handle missing modalities during training and inference. This is done by generating virtual modalities and aligning their semantic spaces with original modalities.

The paper proposes a framework called TRML that extends multimodal foundational models like CLIP to handle missing modalities during training and testing. It does this by generating virtual modalities to replace missing ones and aligning the semantic spaces between original and generated modalities. The goal is to make multimodal learning models more robust to missing data in real-world applications. The method is evaluated on sentiment analysis tasks using standard multimodal datasets.
