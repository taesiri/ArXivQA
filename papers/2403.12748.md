# [Building Brain Tumor Segmentation Networks with User-Assisted Filter   Estimation and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Brain tumor segmentation in MRI images is challenging and deep learning models have shown the best results. However, training these models requires many manually annotated images, which is tedious and time-consuming. 
- Questions remain on how many annotated images are needed, what network architecture works best, and if it's possible to build a network layer-by-layer by selecting the most relevant filters.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called Multi-Step Feature Learning from Image Markers (MS-FLIM) for user-assisted filter estimation and selection. 
- The user draws scribbles (markers) on a few MRI images indicating important regions. 
- For the first convolutional layer, FLIM is run multiple times to estimate varying numbers of filters per marker. The user observes the activations and selects the most relevant filters.
- FLIM then automatically estimates filters for subsequent layers. This builds an encoder capturing all problem-related regions.

Main Contributions:
- A new method called MS-FLIM that involves the user in filter estimation and selection for the first convolutional layer.
- Builds a specialized encoder from just a few user-annotated images.
- Evaluated on glioblastoma segmentation in MRI, comparing MS-FLIM encoder versus FLIM and standard backpropagation.
- MS-FLIM model achieves effectiveness close to state-of-the-art models, showing the promise of user-guided filter learning.
- Demonstrates possibility to build network layer-by-layer by estimating and selecting the most relevant filters.
