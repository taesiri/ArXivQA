# [Rerender A Video: Zero-Shot Text-Guided Video-to-Video Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07954)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How to adapt pre-trained image diffusion models to generate high-quality and temporally coherent videos from text prompts in a zero-shot manner? Specifically, the key challenges are:1) Ensuring temporal consistency across video frames generated by the image diffusion models. Directly generating each frame independently leads to flickering artifacts.2) Achieving this video generation capability in a zero-shot manner without needing to retrain the models on large-scale video datasets.3) Maintaining flexibility and compatibility with existing customized image diffusion models like DreamBooth for more precise style control.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel framework consisting of:1) Key frame translation using an adapted image diffusion model with hierarchical cross-frame constraints to generate temporally coherent key frames.2) Full video translation to efficiently propagate the key frames to other frames using temporal-aware patch matching and blending. This allows high-quality and temporally consistent video generation without retraining, while remaining compatible with customized image models.In summary, the core research contribution is a zero-shot framework to adapt image diffusion models to video domain through innovative hierarchical cross-frame constraints, balancing quality, efficiency and flexibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel zero-shot framework for text-guided video-to-video translation that achieves both global style and local texture temporal consistency without requiring training. Specifically, the key contributions are:- A zero-shot framework consisting of key frame translation with an adapted diffusion model and full video translation with temporal-aware patch propagation and blending. This allows high-quality coherent video generation without training.- Hierarchical cross-frame consistency constraints that enforce temporal coherence in shapes, textures and colors when adapting image diffusion models to videos.- A hybrid diffusion-based generation and patch-based propagation approach to balance quality and efficiency. Diffusion generates high-quality key frames while patch propagation efficiently interpolates the remaining frames.- A fidelity-oriented image encoding method to facilitate the patch-based propagation by reducing autoencoder distortion and error accumulation.The proposed framework is compatible with existing image diffusion models and techniques like custom object generation and spatial control, allowing it to leverage these advances. Experiments demonstrate that it outperforms existing zero-shot video translation methods in terms of temporal consistency while maintaining high visual quality and content-prompt relevance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes a novel zero-shot framework for text-guided video-to-video translation that achieves temporal consistency by applying hierarchical cross-frame constraints to adapt pre-trained image diffusion models to videos, without requiring training or fine-tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a novel framework for text-guided video-to-video translation using diffusion models. It focuses on adapting image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion to generate temporally coherent videos in a zero-shot manner without any training. This sets it apart from other video diffusion models like Video Diffusion Model and Imagen Video which require large-scale training on video datasets.- Compared to other zero-shot video editing methods like Tune-A-Video, Edit-A-Video, and Text2Video-Zero, this paper uniquely proposes hierarchical cross-frame constraints at different diffusion sampling steps to achieve both global style consistency and local texture coherence. The pixel-aware latent fusion is a key contribution for low-level consistency.- The proposed compatibility with customized image diffusion models like DreamBooth and LoRA is valuable, allowing the framework to leverage them for more accurate video stylization without retraining. This flexibility is not present in other recent zero-shot video editing works.- The hybrid diffusion generation and patch-based propagation balances quality and efficiency well. Using optical flow for propagation is not new, but integrating state-of-the-art EbSynth into the framework is an effective design choice.- Compared to seminal patch-based works like image analogy and EbSynth, this paper's coherence between key frames generated by the adapted diffusion model significantly reduces ghosting artifacts during propagation.In summary, the hierarchical cross-frame constraints, pixel-aware fusion, and flexibility of this framework are novel contributions over prior arts. The hybrid strategy also balances well between quality and speed. This paper pushes the state-of-the-art in zero-shot text-guided video editing using diffusion models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Improving optical flow estimation for videos with large motions or appearance changes, which currently limits the performance of their method. They suggest exploring user-interactive translation where users can manually assign key frames.- Exploring different key frame sampling strategies beyond uniform sampling, such as adaptive sampling based on content changes.- Applying the proposed method to other text-guided video editing tasks like video super-resolution, inpainting, etc.- Further improving the fidelity of the image encoding module to better preserve details during the diffusion process.- Extending the framework to leverage additional side information like segmentation masks or depth maps.- Evaluating the method on a wider range of video datasets and prompts.- Improving computational efficiency and reducing video translation time.- Developing extensions for video generation instead of just translation/stylization.In summary, the main future directions are around improving optical flow and key frame selection, applying the framework to more tasks, enhancing the fidelity and efficiency, and extending it for video generation. The compatibility of the proposed method also opens up possibilities to integrate with other diffusion techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper presents a novel zero-shot framework for adapting pre-trained image diffusion models to text-guided video-to-video translation. The key idea is to apply hierarchical cross-frame constraints during the diffusion sampling process to achieve both global style consistency and local texture/shape consistency across video frames. This is done by using the first frame as an anchor, the previous frame as a reference, and optical flow alignment to guide the sampling at different stages. Specifically, cross-frame attention maintains global style consistency, early latent fusion achieves shape coherence, mid-step latent fusion with a proposed fidelity-oriented image encoding achieves texture coherence, and late-step adaptation matches colors. The framework has two parts: key frame translation with the adapted diffusion model, and full video translation by propagating the key frames to non-key frames using temporal-aware patch matching and blending. The zero-shot approach is compatible with existing image diffusion techniques like DreamBooth and ControlNet. Experiments demonstrate the ability to generate high-quality and temporally-coherent stylized videos without retraining the models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a novel zero-shot framework for text-guided video-to-video translation, which can render a source video into a new stylistic video guided by a text description. The framework has two main components: 1) An adapted diffusion model to generate coherent key frames. It applies hierarchical cross-frame constraints on shapes, textures, and colors to achieve both global style consistency and local temporal consistency between key frames. 2) A hybrid diffusion and propagation approach to render the full video. Key frames are generated with the adapted diffusion model, then interpolated to remaining frames using temporal-aware patch matching and blending. The proposed framework is zero-shot, requiring no training or fine-tuning. It is compatible with existing image diffusion models and techniques like DreamBooth and ControlNet. This allows leveraging customized image models for precise video stylization. Experiments demonstrate the framework generates high-quality and temporally coherent stylized videos. It outperforms recent zero-shot video translation methods in visual quality, content-prompt balance, and temporal consistency. Limitations include reliance on accurate optical flow and key frame coverage. Overall, the proposed hierarchical constraints offer an effective strategy to adapt image diffusion models to coherent video generation.
