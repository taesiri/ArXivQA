# [Rerender A Video: Zero-Shot Text-Guided Video-to-Video Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07954)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How to adapt pre-trained image diffusion models to generate high-quality and temporally coherent videos from text prompts in a zero-shot manner? Specifically, the key challenges are:1) Ensuring temporal consistency across video frames generated by the image diffusion models. Directly generating each frame independently leads to flickering artifacts.2) Achieving this video generation capability in a zero-shot manner without needing to retrain the models on large-scale video datasets.3) Maintaining flexibility and compatibility with existing customized image diffusion models like DreamBooth for more precise style control.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel framework consisting of:1) Key frame translation using an adapted image diffusion model with hierarchical cross-frame constraints to generate temporally coherent key frames.2) Full video translation to efficiently propagate the key frames to other frames using temporal-aware patch matching and blending. This allows high-quality and temporally consistent video generation without retraining, while remaining compatible with customized image models.In summary, the core research contribution is a zero-shot framework to adapt image diffusion models to video domain through innovative hierarchical cross-frame constraints, balancing quality, efficiency and flexibility.
