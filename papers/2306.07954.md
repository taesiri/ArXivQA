# [Rerender A Video: Zero-Shot Text-Guided Video-to-Video Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07954)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How to adapt pre-trained image diffusion models to generate high-quality and temporally coherent videos from text prompts in a zero-shot manner? Specifically, the key challenges are:1) Ensuring temporal consistency across video frames generated by the image diffusion models. Directly generating each frame independently leads to flickering artifacts.2) Achieving this video generation capability in a zero-shot manner without needing to retrain the models on large-scale video datasets.3) Maintaining flexibility and compatibility with existing customized image diffusion models like DreamBooth for more precise style control.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel framework consisting of:1) Key frame translation using an adapted image diffusion model with hierarchical cross-frame constraints to generate temporally coherent key frames.2) Full video translation to efficiently propagate the key frames to other frames using temporal-aware patch matching and blending. This allows high-quality and temporally consistent video generation without retraining, while remaining compatible with customized image models.In summary, the core research contribution is a zero-shot framework to adapt image diffusion models to video domain through innovative hierarchical cross-frame constraints, balancing quality, efficiency and flexibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel zero-shot framework for text-guided video-to-video translation that achieves both global style and local texture temporal consistency without requiring training. Specifically, the key contributions are:- A zero-shot framework consisting of key frame translation with an adapted diffusion model and full video translation with temporal-aware patch propagation and blending. This allows high-quality coherent video generation without training.- Hierarchical cross-frame consistency constraints that enforce temporal coherence in shapes, textures and colors when adapting image diffusion models to videos.- A hybrid diffusion-based generation and patch-based propagation approach to balance quality and efficiency. Diffusion generates high-quality key frames while patch propagation efficiently interpolates the remaining frames.- A fidelity-oriented image encoding method to facilitate the patch-based propagation by reducing autoencoder distortion and error accumulation.The proposed framework is compatible with existing image diffusion models and techniques like custom object generation and spatial control, allowing it to leverage these advances. Experiments demonstrate that it outperforms existing zero-shot video translation methods in terms of temporal consistency while maintaining high visual quality and content-prompt relevance.
