# [Learning the Causal Structure of Networked Dynamical Systems under   Latent Nodes and Structured Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers the problem of learning the hidden causal network structure (graph) of a linear networked dynamical system (NDS) from partial time series observations of the system states, under the challenging condition of correlated noise driving the dynamics. Reconstructing the underlying network is important for applications like modeling brain connectivity, gene regulatory networks, etc. However, correlated noise creates spurious associations between node pairs, making accurate inference very difficult, especially with partial observability.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel feature-based framework for this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Design informative features for each node pair that can distinguish between connected and disconnected pairs even under correlated noise. This is done by combining multiple covariance-based statistics. 

2) Prove new theoretical results showing these features can identify connectivity despite correlated noise, if the noise heterogeneity satisfies certain constraints.

3) Use supervised learning on the features to classify each node pair as connected/disconnected and reconstruct the full network. Neural networks are used for classification.

Main Contributions:

- New identifiability theorems for linear NDS showing network structure can be recovered under correlated noise if noise heterogeneity constraints are met (Theorem 2). This provides fundamental limits on reconstructability.  

- Introduction of new hand-crafted features for each node pair that are robust to drifts/perturbations from correlated noise and enable accurate classification (Eq. 6).

- Demonstration that simple feedforward neural networks trained on these features can accurately reconstruct sparse/dense synthetic networks and real-world brain networks under various noise correlation levels. 

In summary, the paper provides important new analysis on identifiability of causal networks under challenging noise conditions, designs informative features to enable learning despite this noise, and shows via experiments that the approach accurately recovers network structure in varied scenarios.
