# [CritiqueLLM: Scaling LLM-as-Critic for Effective and Explainable   Evaluation of Large Language Model Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18702)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes CritiqueLLM, a new critique generation model for evaluating the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs). The key goal is to develop an effective LLM-based evaluator that can provide high-quality critiques including scores and explanations without relying on external services. The proposed method includes: (1) automatically constructing a training dataset using a dialogue-based prompting approach to get high-quality referenced and reference-free human annotations from GPT-4; (2) supervised fine-tuning of CritiqueLLM models with different scales (6B to 66B parameters) on this dataset; and (3) generating critiques using decoding strategies like self-consistency. Experiments on AlignBench show CritiqueLLM-66B achieves comparable performance to GPT-4 in referenced evaluation and even outperforms it in 3 out of 8 tasks for reference-free evaluation. Detailed analysis demonstrates good scaling properties of data and models, the utility of generated explanations, and the efficacy of critiques as feedback to improve existing LLMs. The results highlight the potential of CritiqueLLM to replace GPT-4 evaluation with further scaling.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Critique generation - The paper focuses on training models called "CritiqueLLM" to generate critiques (including scores and explanations) to evaluate the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs). 

- Referenced and reference-free evaluation - The critiques can be generated in referenced settings (comparing to a reference text) or reference-free settings.

- Dialogue-based prompting - A method proposed in the paper to collect high-quality referenced and reference-free training data by prompting the LLM GPT-4 in a two-turn dialogue.

- Scaling properties - The paper analyzes the impact of model scale and training data size on the quality of generated critiques, studying the scaling capabilities.

- Feedback to improve LLMs - Demonstrates the utility of generated critiques as scalable feedback to directly enhance the quality of language generation by LLMs.

- Evaluation metrics - Uses metrics like Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation coefficients to evaluate critique quality at text-level and system-level.

- AlignBench dataset - Uses this benchmark dataset for evaluating instruction following in open-ended tasks for Chinese language.

In summary, the key focus is on scaling up critique generation models to provide effective and explainable evaluation as well as feedback for improving LLMs.
