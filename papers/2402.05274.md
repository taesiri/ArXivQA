# [Convergence for Natural Policy Gradient on Infinite-State Average-Reward   Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05274)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies infinite-state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with average reward objectives. These models are important for optimizing queueing systems and other engineering problems. 

- Prior work has studied the Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithm for finite-state MDPs. NPG lies at the core of many reinforcement learning algorithms. However, there are no convergence guarantees for NPG in infinite-state average reward MDPs.

- Existing convergence proofs for finite MDPs make assumptions that fail to hold in the infinite setting. New proof techniques are needed.


Contributions:

- The paper proves the first sample complexity bound for NPG in infinite-state average reward MDPs. Specifically, it shows that given a good initial policy, NPG achieves $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence to the optimal policy.

- The analysis relies on novel state-dependent bounds on the growth rate of the relative value function for NPG iterate policies. This allows setting a state-dependent step size schedule.  

- For an important class of queueing MDPs, the paper shows the popular MaxWeight policy satisfies requirements for a good initial policy. So NPG with MaxWeight initialization provably converges.

- Methodologically, the state-dependent analysis framework is novel and could enable convergence proofs for other RL algorithms in infinite MDPs.

In summary, the paper provides the first convergence rate guarantee for an important policy optimization algorithm in infinite-state average reward MDPs. It also demonstrates the guarantee for a useful class of queueing models. The state-dependent analysis approach is innovative. Overall, this is an important theoretical contribution towards reliable reinforcement learning in infinite models.
