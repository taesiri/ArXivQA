# [Composite Active Learning: Towards Multi-Domain Active Learning with   Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02110)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Composite Active Learning: Towards Multi-Domain Active Learning with Theoretical Guarantees":

Problem:
- Existing active learning (AL) methods focus on a single-domain setting, where all data comes from the same domain/dataset. However, many real-world applications involve data from multiple domains.
- Applying standard single-domain AL separately on each domain is suboptimal because it (1) ignores similarity among domains when assigning labeling budget and cross-domain generalization, and (2) fails to handle distribution shift across domains.

Proposed Solution - Composite Active Learning (CAL):  
- Key idea: Construct a "surrogate" domain for each original domain, consisting of a weighted collection of labeled data from all domains. Weights indicate cross-domain similarity.
- Jointly estimate similarity weights and learn an encoder to map inputs to an aligned feature space, thereby reducing distribution shift. This is done by minimizing an upper bound on the average error over all domains.
- Assign labeling budget to each domain proportional to its total similarity weight (similarity to all domains).  
- Apply any standard AL query strategy (uncertainty/diversity-based) for instance-level selection.

Main Contributions:
- First general deep AL method to incorporate both domain-level and instance-level information for multi-domain AL.
- Theoretically analyze CAL and prove it achieves better error bounds compared to standard AL baselines. 
- Empirically demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art AL methods on both synthetic and real-world multi-domain datasets.
- Approach is compatible with any existing instance-level query strategies.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel deep active learning framework, CAL, specifically designed for multi-domain data by effectively modeling domain similarities and handling distribution shifts. Both theoretical and empirical results validate the advantages of CAL over traditional single-domain active learning methods.
