# [KnowGPT: Black-Box Knowledge Injection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06185)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes KnowGPT, a novel framework for black-box knowledge injection into large language models (LLMs) for question answering. The key idea is to leverage external knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT, while only having access to their prediction APIs (treating them as black boxes). KnowGPT has two main components: (1) A deep reinforcement learning-based path extraction module that searches the KG to find relevant and concise reasoning paths connecting question concepts to potential answers. This helps select the most informative knowledge. (2) A multi-armed bandit strategy for prompt construction that learns to pick the best combination of path extraction method and prompt template for each question. Experiments on CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA and MedQA datasets show KnowGPT significantly outperforms existing methods. Notably, it improves ChatGPT's accuracy by 23.7% on average, and even surpasses state-of-the-art GPT-4 despite only using ChatGPT's API. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of black-box knowledge injection in enhancing reasoning for LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes KnowGPT, a black-box knowledge injection framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to extract relevant paths from knowledge graphs and uses multi-armed bandits to construct optimal prompts to inject knowledge into large language models through their APIs to improve their question answering performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It formally defines the problem of "black-box knowledge injection for large language models" in complex question answering. This refers to integrating knowledge graphs into language models that only provide an API, without access to the model internals.

2. It proposes KnowGPT, a framework for black-box knowledge injection that has two main components:
(a) A deep reinforcement learning method to extract informative and concise reasoning paths from a knowledge graph. 
(b) A multi-armed bandit algorithm to automatically select the best knowledge extraction strategy and prompt template for each question.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on three QA datasets, including both commonsense and domain-specific QA, which demonstrate KnowGPT's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, KnowGPT achieves 91.6% accuracy on the OpenbookQA leaderboard, comparable to human performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and effective framework, KnowGPT, for injecting knowledge graphs into black-box language models to improve their reasoning and question answering abilities.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generative large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer superior performance on many NLP tasks. However, they often give inaccurate responses when faced with questions requiring domain-specific knowledge not covered in their training data. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art LLMs are not open-source, making it hard to inject knowledge into them. 

The paper formally defines the problem of "black-box knowledge injection for LLMs" - integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into LLMs using only their model APIs, without access to model internals. The challenges are: (1) identifying the most relevant knowledge from large KGs, and (2) effectively encoding the knowledge into prompts for the LLM.

Proposed Solution - KnowGPT:
The paper proposes KnowGPT, a black-box knowledge injection framework with two key components:

1. Path Extraction using Deep Reinforcement Learning: Extracts reasoning paths from the KG connecting question entities to answer entities. Uses a tailored reward scheme promoting reachability, context-relatedness and conciseness of paths. 

2. Prompt Construction using Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB): Selects the best path extraction strategy and prompt template for each question by balancing exploration and exploitation. Implemented with 2 strategies and 3 templates.

Main Contributions:
1. Formally defines black-box knowledge injection problem for LLMs 
2. Proposes KnowGPT framework using deep RL for path extraction and MAB for prompt construction
3. Extensive experiments on 3 QA datasets show KnowGPT significantly outperforms SOTA methods and enhances ChatGPT by 23.7% on average

In summary, the paper addresses an important problem of effectively integrating knowledge into black-box LLMs like ChatGPT. The proposed KnowGPT framework provides an effective solution using deep RL and MAB, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
