## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes KnowGPT, a novel framework for black-box knowledge injection into large language models (LLMs) for question answering. The key idea is to leverage external knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT, while only having access to their prediction APIs (treating them as black boxes). KnowGPT has two main components: (1) A deep reinforcement learning-based path extraction module that searches the KG to find relevant and concise reasoning paths connecting question concepts to potential answers. This helps select the most informative knowledge. (2) A multi-armed bandit strategy for prompt construction that learns to pick the best combination of path extraction method and prompt template for each question. Experiments on CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA and MedQA datasets show KnowGPT significantly outperforms existing methods. Notably, it improves ChatGPT's accuracy by 23.7% on average, and even surpasses state-of-the-art GPT-4 despite only using ChatGPT's API. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of black-box knowledge injection in enhancing reasoning for LLMs.
