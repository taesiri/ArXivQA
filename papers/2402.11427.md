# [OptEx: Expediting First-Order Optimization with Approximately   Parallelized Iterations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
First-order optimization (FOO) algorithms like stochastic gradient descent are pivotal for many applications like machine learning. However, they require a large number of sequential iterations to converge which is inefficient, especially for complex tasks like neural network training. Parallel computing has been used to reduce the time per iteration but the inherent iterative dependency in FOO makes it hard to parallelize the iterations themselves.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework called "First-Order Optimization Expedited with Approximately Parallelized Iterations" (OptEx) to enable approximate iteration parallelism in FOO using the following key ideas:

1) Kernelized gradient estimation: Uses gradient history to estimate gradients at any input, enabling proxy updates to approximate future iterations and bypass FOO's iterative dependency. Provides theoretical guarantees on estimation quality.

2) Multi-step proxy updates: Uses FOO and estimated gradients to approximate inputs for next N iterations, breaking iteration dependency. Maintains optimizer states across proxy updates.

3) Parallel iterations: Runs FOO with evaluated gradients on the N inputs from proxy updates in parallel. Dynamically selects input for next iteration.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework to enable approximate iteration parallelism in FOO using gradient history, breaking inherent dependency. Enables iteration speedup through parallelism.

2) Theoretical analysis proving estimation errors reduce as history grows, and SGD-OptEx can achieve iteration complexity speedup of Θ(√N) given parallelism N.

3) Empirical evaluation on synthetic functions, RL tasks and neural network training demonstrating consistent acceleration over vanilla FOO algorithms through OptEx's iteration parallelism. Up to 2x speedup shown.

In summary, the paper makes algorithmic and theoretical contributions to enable approximate iteration parallelism in FOO through kernelized gradient prediction. This helps mitigate FOO's iterative bottlenecks, accelerating performance on complex tasks, with broad applicability.
