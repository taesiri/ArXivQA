# [NToP: NeRF-Powered Large-scale Dataset Generation for 2D and 3D Human   Pose Estimation in Top-View Fisheye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18196)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Human pose estimation (HPE) using top-view fisheye cameras is a promising application, but lacks large-scale datasets with high-quality 2D and 3D keypoint annotations.
- Existing top-view HPE datasets are scarce, synthetic, or low-resolution. The domain gap limits performance. 

Proposed Solution:
- Present a pipeline called NToP to generate high-quality semi-synthetic top-view HPE datasets using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).
- Train one NeRF model per person on existing multi-view datasets like Human3.6M and GeneBody. 
- Render images from top-view virtual fisheye cameras around the person using novel poses.
- Extract 2D and 3D keypoint ground truth annotations.

Main Contributions:
- NToP pipeline to render realistic top-view human images tailored for HPE using NeRF.
- Large-scale dataset called NToP570K with over 570K images rendered from 43 actors across 3 source datasets.
- 2D and 3D keypoint annotations, segmentation masks, camera parameters provided. 
- Finetuning state-of-the-art pose estimators like ViTPose and HybrIK-Transformer on NToP570K gives 33.3% AP gain and 53.7mm error reduction, proving its efficacy.

In summary, the paper presents a way to use NeRF to generate high-quality semi-synthetic data to tackle the problem of lack of datasets for the promising top-view human pose estimation application. The large-scale NToP570K dataset bridges the domain gap and could enable future innovations in this area.
