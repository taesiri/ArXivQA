# [DreamVideo: Composing Your Dream Videos with Customized Subject and   Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04433)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DreamVideo, a novel approach for customized video generation that can synthesize videos featuring a user-specified subject endowed with a desired motion. It decouples video customization into subject learning and motion learning stages. For subject learning, it first optimizes a textual identity to represent the coarse concept, then trains an identity adapter on provided images to capture fine details. For motion learning, it designs a motion adapter trained on given videos to capture the inherent motion pattern, while using an image feature as guidance so the adapter focuses solely on motion. These lightweight adapters allow flexible customization of any subject with any motion. Extensive experiments on a dataset with 20 customized subjects and 30 motions demonstrate DreamVideo's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in generating videos with customized subjects and motions. Key advantages are its flexibility in arbitrarily combining customized subjects and motions, efficiency from the lightweight adapters, and high visual quality.
