# [Vehicle: Bridging the Embedding Gap in the Verification of   Neuro-Symbolic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Vehicle: Bridging the Embedding Gap in the Verification of Neuro-Symbolic Programs":

Problem:
The paper identifies two key issues in verifying neural-symbolic programs (programs containing both machine learning and symbolic components):

1) The "embedding gap": There is a lack of techniques for linking high-level, semantically meaningful "problem space" properties of machine learning components to low-level "embedding space" properties that verification tools reason about. This makes it difficult to verify how the ML components influence the overall system behavior.

2) Lack of integration between disparate verification tools: Proving properties about neural networks requires specialized ATPs, while proving properties about the broader system requires ITPs. These use very different input formats/semantics, requiring tedious replication of specifications.

Proposed Solution - The Vehicle Framework:

The paper proposes Vehicle, a framework aimed at facilitating the end-to-end verification of neural-symbolic programs. Vehicle provides:

1) A high-level language for specifying meaningful "problem space" properties of neural networks.

2) A compiler that automatically compiles these into:
   a) Loss functions for training neural networks to satisfy properties
   b) Queries for neural network verifiers like Marabou
   c) Formal embeddings of properties in ITPs like Agda
   
This allows for modular reasoning - using ATPs for neural network components and ITPs for system properties. Specifications need only be written once.

The framework is designed to be general, supporting various specification logics and verification techniques.

Contributions:

1) Identification of the "embedding gap" as a key challenge in verifying neural-symbolic programs.

2) Vehicle framework and language for writing meaningful specifications and linking neural network verification to system verification.

3) Methodology for end-to-end modular formal verification of neural-symbolic systems using Vehicle.

4) Case study demonstrating utility of Vehicle by verifying safety of a neural network controlled autonomous car.

5) Formal proof in Agda of soundness of Vehicle's compilation to training loss functions and verifier queries.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Vehicle, a tool to facilitate the end-to-end verification of neural-symbolic programs by bridging the embedding gap through automatic compilation of human-readable specifications to machine-readable formats for training, verification, and integration with larger system proofs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Vehicle, a tool designed to facilitate the end-to-end verification of neural-symbolic programs. Specifically:

- Vehicle provides a convenient language for specifying "problem-space" properties of neural networks and declaring their relationship to the "embedding-space". 

- It features a powerful compiler that automates interpretation of these specifications in the languages of various machine learning training environments, neural network verifiers, and interactive theorem provers.

- This allows for modular, end-to-end verification of neural-symbolic programs, leveraging the strengths of different tools. Vehicle bridges the "embedding gap" - the previous lack of techniques for linking high-level properties to equivalent properties over neural network embeddings.

- The authors demonstrate Vehicle's utility by using it to formally verify the safety of a simple autonomous car controller implemented with a neural network. This modular proof utilizes both automated theorem provers and interactive theorem provers.

In summary, Vehicle enables interpretability and reuse of specifications across training, verification, and integration of neural components into larger system proofs, facilitating the end-to-end verification of neuro-symbolic programs.

The paper introduces Vehicle, a tool to facilitate the end-to-end verification of neural-symbolic programs. It identifies the "embedding gap" in linking semantic problem space properties to equivalent embedding space properties as a key challenge.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper identifies the "embedding gap" as a key issue in verifying neuro-symbolic programs. What specifically constitutes this embedding gap and why is it an obstacle to verification?

2) The paper proposes a modular, end-to-end verification approach for neuro-symbolic programs. Can you explain the key components of this approach and how they fit together? In particular, discuss the roles of the specification language, training platform, verifiers, and interactive theorem provers. 

3) The Vehicle specification language allows expressing high-level, problem-space properties of neural networks. What key features of this language enable convenient specification of neural networks? Discuss notions like binding neural networks and datasets, first-class quantifiers, higher-order functions etc.

4) Explain in detail the process of compiling a Vehicle specification to (i) a Tensorflow loss function for training and (ii) a set of queries for the Marabou verifier. What translations and transformations are involved?

5) The paper claims the Vehicle compiler automates interpretation of problem-space properties in the languages of various backend tools. Substantiate this claim by elaborating the interface with training platforms and verifiers.

6) Discuss the soundness of the Vehicle compiler. What formal artifacts have been constructed to argue the correctness of compilation to different backends? Give a brief overview.

7) The paper demonstrates the utility of Vehicle by verifying a neuro-symbolic car controller. Summarize this example and discuss how the modular verification approach was applied on it.

8) What are some limitations of Vehicle's domain of applicability? When can its methodology NOT be applied currently? Discuss how the tool relates to verification of complex ML models without clearly defined specifications.

9) The paper identifies integrating specifications into training as an important consideration for neuro-symbolic systems. Elaborate why directly training networks for verification properties is significant.

10) Vehicle focuses on the problem-space for specifications. Discuss the benefits of problem-space specifications over conventional network-space specifications expressed directly over embeddings.
