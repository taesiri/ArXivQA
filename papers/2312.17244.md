# [The LLM Surgeon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
State-of-the-art language models are becoming very large in order to achieve high performance on available textual data. However, their huge size makes deployment difficult due to computational, environmental or device constraints. Training smaller models from scratch is not always a good solution. Therefore, the authors explore data-driven compression of existing pretrained models as an alternative.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a method called "LLM Surgeon" to compress large language models in a data-driven way. The key ideas are:

1) Use Kronecker-factored approximations of the loss landscape curvature, which scales to large models while remaining practical. This allows computing costs of removing parameters as well as updated values for remaining parameters.

2) Provide a general framework for unstructured, semi-structured and structured pruning. Go beyond independent weight updates to consider correlations between weights for better updates.

3) Prune in multiple shots - remove some parameters, update others, reestimate curvature, and repeat. This handles larger parameter changes.

4) Allow trading off compute time during compression for accuracy by considering more weight correlations and more shots.

5) Use optional low-rank updates between shots to further improve performance.

Main Contributions:

- First method to successfully perform structured pruning of language models, removing entire rows/columns of weight matrices.

- State-of-the-art results for unstructured and semi-structured pruning of large language models. 

- General framework supporting unstructured, semi-structured and structured pruning as well as trading off compression time and accuracy.

- Can compress models substantially (20-30% smaller) with minimal performance loss, allowing "horizontal scaling" between existing models.

In summary, the paper provides an effective data-driven compression technique to reduce the huge computational and memory costs of large language models for improved deployment. The method is general, achieves state-of-the-art results, and uniquely supports structured pruning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces LLM Surgeon, a method that uses data-driven compression based on scaling Kronecker-factored curvature approximations to optimally prune large language models in an unstructured, semi-structured or structured way while minimizing impact on performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a general framework called LLM Surgeon for unstructured, semi-structured and structured pruning of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- It scales up block-diagonal Kronecker-factored approximations of the empirical Fisher to enable accurate structured pruning of LLMs. This allows removing entire rows and columns from weight matrices while minimizing the increase in loss.

- It provides a way to compute costs and weight updates for correlated removal of multiple rows, columns or individual weights. This accounts for more correlations between weights compared to prior work. 

- It introduces a multi-shot pruning schedule and optional interleaved low-rank updates to improve compression performance.

- Experimentally, LLM Surgeon achieves state-of-the-art results in unstructured and semi-structured LLM pruning. More importantly, it gives the first practically usable results for structured pruning of LLMs, allowing models to be compressed by up to 30% with minimal impact on performance.

In summary, LLM Surgeon enables accurate structured pruning for large language models by better approximating the loss landscape curvature and considering weight correlations. It provides a general framework applicable to different pruning types and improves compression performance over strong baselines.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Language models (LLMs) - The paper focuses on compressing and pruning large language models to make them more efficient. LLMs like OPT and Llama are used in the experiments.

- Pruning - Removing or zeroing out parameters from neural networks to make them smaller and more efficient. Different pruning techniques like unstructured, structured, and semi-structured pruning are explored.

- Compression - Reducing the size of models while trying to maintain performance. This is done through pruning as well as weight updates to account for removed parameters.

- Kronecker-factored approximations - Using Kronecker factorizations of the Fisher information matrix to approximate the curvature of the loss landscape. This allows the method to scale to large models.

- Correlated weight updates - Computing weight updates that account for correlations between parameters that are pruned instead of treating them independently. 

- Dynamic weight allocation - Allowing different layers to be pruned to different levels by using a global threshold, rather than fixing the pruning rate per layer.

- Multi-shot pruning - Pruning networks progressively in multiple steps instead of one-shot pruning. This allows for more accurate curvature approximation.

So in summary, the key focus is on computationally efficient compression techniques like pruning for large language models, using approximations of the loss curvature to guide the process.

8. How does the use of global thresholding enable dynamic allocation of sparsity levels across layers? What are the expected benefits of this data-driven approach compared to uniform layerwise pruning?

9. The method computes layerwise Fisher blocks from input activations and output gradients. What are some potential issues with the quality of this approximation and how might the nearest Kronecker product estimation help?

10. The paper focuses on structured pruning for large transformer models. What modifications would be needed to apply the method to convolutional neural networks or other architectures? What new challenges might arise?
