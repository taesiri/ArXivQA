# [MultiFIX: An XAI-friendly feature inducing approach to building models   from multimodal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal machine learning approaches that combine different data types can outperform single-modality methods. However, most state-of-the-art approaches rely on complex deep neural networks that are not interpretable or explainable.
- Interpretability and explainability are critical in high-stake domains like healthcare, but current interpretable multimodal learning methods are limited. 

Proposed Solution - MultiFIX:
- A new multimodal learning framework focused on interpretability by explicit feature induction from each modality.
- Uses end-to-end deep learning initially to enable joint training.
- Images: Attention maps highlight important regions using Grad-CAM. 
- Tabular: Genetic Programming is used to evolve small symbolic expressions describing contributions.
- Fusion: Genetic Programming also explains how induced features are combined.

Key Contributions:
- Enables embedded feature engineering from multiple modalities.
- Provides visual and symbolic explanations of induced features and fusion. 
- Demonstrated on synthetic and real-world skin lesion classification.
- Identifies limitations of using backpropagation for very complex multimodal dependencies.
- Calls for deeper integration of evolutionary methods to scale to more complex multimodal problems.

In summary, MultiFIX is a new interpretable multimodal learning pipeline that induces explanatory features from each data type and fuses them to make predictions. It provides modular explanations of the model via heatmaps and symbolic expressions. Results indicate strengths on simpler problems and limitations on very complex feature dependencies, highlighting needs for advanced evolutionary machine learning.
