# [MultiFIX: An XAI-friendly feature inducing approach to building models   from multimodal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal machine learning approaches that combine different data types can outperform single-modality methods. However, most state-of-the-art approaches rely on complex deep neural networks that are not interpretable or explainable.
- Interpretability and explainability are critical in high-stake domains like healthcare, but current interpretable multimodal learning methods are limited. 

Proposed Solution - MultiFIX:
- A new multimodal learning framework focused on interpretability by explicit feature induction from each modality.
- Uses end-to-end deep learning initially to enable joint training.
- Images: Attention maps highlight important regions using Grad-CAM. 
- Tabular: Genetic Programming is used to evolve small symbolic expressions describing contributions.
- Fusion: Genetic Programming also explains how induced features are combined.

Key Contributions:
- Enables embedded feature engineering from multiple modalities.
- Provides visual and symbolic explanations of induced features and fusion. 
- Demonstrated on synthetic and real-world skin lesion classification.
- Identifies limitations of using backpropagation for very complex multimodal dependencies.
- Calls for deeper integration of evolutionary methods to scale to more complex multimodal problems.

In summary, MultiFIX is a new interpretable multimodal learning pipeline that induces explanatory features from each data type and fuses them to make predictions. It provides modular explanations of the model via heatmaps and symbolic expressions. Results indicate strengths on simpler problems and limitations on very complex feature dependencies, highlighting needs for advanced evolutionary machine learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MultiFIX, a multimodal machine learning framework that induces separate explainable features from different data types which are then combined to make final predictions, enabling model transparency regarding the contribution of each data modality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing MultiFIX, a new interpretability-focused multimodal data fusion pipeline. Specifically:

1) MultiFIX induces separate features from different data types (e.g. images, tabular data) that can subsequently be combined to make a final prediction. 

2) An end-to-end deep learning architecture is used to train a predictive model and extract representative features of each modality. 

3) Each part of the model is then explained using explainable AI techniques: attention maps for images, symbolic expressions evolved with genetic programming for tabular features, and another symbolic expression for the fusion.

4) This allows understanding the contribution of each modality to the final prediction, aiming to maximize explainability.

5) Results on synthetic problems and a real dataset for skin lesion classification demonstrate MultiFIX's ability to build accurate and interpretable multimodal models. 

In summary, the main contribution is proposing MultiFIX as an interpretable pipeline for fusing and explaining predictions from multimodal data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. MultiFIX consists of separate feature-inducing blocks for each data type and a fusion block. What are the key advantages of having an explicit feature induction phase before fusion? How does this impact model interpretability compared to other multimodal approaches?

2. The paper mentions using different types of models (e.g. neural networks, genetic programming) in the feature-induction and fusion blocks. What are the tradeoffs in using different models? Why was genetic programming chosen for obtaining symbolic expressions?  

3. Heatmaps and symbolic expressions are used to explain the induced features from images and tabular data respectively. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these explanation techniques? When would you choose one over the other?

4. The paper identifies a key limitation of MultiFIX in modeling complex dependencies between modalities, specifically for problems like the 3-gated XOR. It mentions more sophisticated optimization without backpropagation as a potential solution. What specific techniques could help address this limitation?  

5. For the XOR problem, adding an autoencoder helped enable learning. Why was the autoencoder pre-training useful in this case? How did temporarily freezing vs unfreezing the autoencoder impact results?

6. The results show that MultiFIX improved over single modality performance on most synthetic datasets. But for the real-world melanoma dataset, no clear benefit from multimodal modeling was observed. What could be the reasons behind this?

7. The paper concludes that stronger integration of evolutionary methods is needed for MultiFIX to scale effectively. What specific roles could evolutionary computation play in the future development of MultiFIX?

8. How suitable is MultiFIX for online learning scenarios where new modalities are progressively added? Would you need to retrain from scratch each time?

9. Feature selection is performed implicitly in MultiFIX based on predictive performance. Should explicit dimensionality reduction be added before the feature induction blocks? What benefits would this provide?

10. What additional modalities could MultiFIX be applied to? Would certain modalities like video, text etc. require custom modifications to the overall framework?
