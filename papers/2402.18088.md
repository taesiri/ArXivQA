# [Bimanual Manipulation of Steady Hand Eye Robots with Adaptive Sclera   Force Control: Cooperative vs. Teleoperation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common eye disease that can lead to vision loss. Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a potential surgical treatment but is very challenging due to the small size of retinal veins (150 μm) compared to typical surgeon hand tremors (182 μm RMS amplitude). 

- Existing cooperative control methods for surgical robots assisting with RVC, like the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER), do not adequately control scleral forces. Excess scleral forces can distort and damage eye tissue.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a bimanual adaptive teleoperation (BMAT) control framework that integrates an adaptive scleral force control algorithm. 

- It uses two SHER robots (SHER 2.0 and SHER 2.1) along with two force-sensing tools equipped with FBG sensors to measure scleral forces. The adaptive controller automatically adjusts robot motion to maintain safe scleral forces below 120mN.

- BMAT provides teleoperation capabilities lacking in existing cooperative control methods, like intuitive motion scaling and clutching for repositioning. This can improve surgeon precision, comfort and patient safety.

- Experiments compare BMAT to bimanual adaptive cooperative control on an anatomically accurate phantom eye, having surgeons perform a vessel following task simulating cannulation. Both sitting and standing postures are tested.

Contributions:
- First implementation of a bimanual adaptive teleoperation control framework with adaptive scleral force control for robot-assisted retinal surgery.

- Demonstrated that BMAT can safely manipulate the eye bimanually without robot registration, avoiding unsafe stretching of tissue.  

- Showed comparable or better performance of BMAT over cooperative control in metrics like scleral forces, completion times and percentage over safe scleral force thresholds.

- Showed BMAT capabilities like motion scaling and repositioning improve surgeon precision and comfort over cooperative control.

In summary, the paper presents a novel bimanual adaptive teleoperation control framework for robot-assisted retinal surgery that integrates scleral force control to improve surgeon precision and patient safety. Experiments demonstrate safe bimanual manipulation and advantages over existing cooperative control methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a bimanual adaptive teleoperation control framework integrated with an adaptive sclera force control algorithm for robot-assisted retinal microsurgery using two Steady-Hand Eye Robots (SHER 2.0 and SHER 2.1), compares its performance to a bimanual adaptive cooperative control mode in vessel-following experiments under a microscope in sitting and standing postures, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the bimanual teleoperation mode in improving safety and precision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the implementation and evaluation of a bimanual adaptive teleoperation (BMAT) control framework integrated with an adaptive sclera force control algorithm on the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) systems for robot-assisted retinal microsurgery. Specifically:

- They extended a previously developed single-manual adaptive teleoperation framework with adaptive sclera force control to a bimanual control framework using two SHER robots (SHER 2.0 and SHER 2.1) and two force-sensing tools. 

- They compared the performance of this bimanual teleoperation framework against a bimanual adaptive cooperative (BMAC) control framework in vessel-following experiments using an eye phantom model. Experiments were conducted for both sitting and standing postures.

- The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bimanual adaptive teleoperation framework in limiting sclera forces and completion times comparably or better than the cooperative control mode. This shows its promise in improving safety and surgeon comfort in robot-assisted retinal microsurgeries.

- To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to implement and evaluate a bimanual adaptive teleoperation control integrated with adaptive sclera force control on surgical robots for retinal microsurgery applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes an adaptive sclera force control algorithm to minimize the tool-sclera interaction force. Can you explain in detail how this algorithm works and how the desired sclera force trajectories fdx and fdy are calculated? 

2) The paper integrates the adaptive sclera force control algorithm into both a bimanual cooperative control framework (BMAC) and a bimanual teleoperation framework (BMAT). Can you walk through the specific control algorithms used in each framework and highlight the key differences between BMAC and BMAT?

3) The BMAT control framework consists of three components: a high-level controller, a mid-level optimizer, and a low-level joint velocity controller. Can you explain the role of each component and how they work together to enable bimanual teleoperation? 

4) Two FBG-based force-sensing tools are used in the experiments to measure sclera force and tooltip force. How are these sensors calibrated? And what is the advantage of using FBG sensors over other force sensing modalities?

5) The performance of BMAC and BMAT are compared through a vessel-following experiment using an eye phantom. Can you explain the specifics of this experiment in detail and how the phantom eye is designed to replicate key features of a human eye?

6) Various metrics are used to evaluate and compare BMAC versus BMAT, including mean/max sclera force, percentage of time above safe sclera force threshold, user hand force/torque, and task completion time. Why are each of these metrics important for assessing performance?

7) Experiments are conducted in both sitting and standing postures. What are the observed differences in performance between these postures and why does the user perform better sitting versus standing?

8) What are the potential benefits offered by the bimanual teleoperation framework over the cooperative control framework for robot-assisted retinal surgery? Can you expand on some of these benefits beyond what is discussed in the paper?

9) The paper focuses on controlling sclera forces. However, what other forces should ideally be controlled during intricate retinal procedures? Why would controlling these additional forces be important?

10) The results demonstrate feasibility of safe bimanual manipulation without registering the two robots by regulating sclera forces. However, for clinical adoption, what additional experimentation with more realistic tissue models needs to be conducted before human trials?
