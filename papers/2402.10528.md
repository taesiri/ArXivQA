# [Can We Verify Step by Step for Incorrect Answer Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10528)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, there is little research on quantitatively assessing whether evaluating the intermediate reasoning steps can predict correctness of the final outputs. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces a new benchmark called R2PE (Relationship of Rationales to Performance Evaluation) spanning 5 domains with data from 6 LLMs to quantitatively analyze the link between rationales and end-task performance.

- They propose a process discernibility score (PDS) framework that outperforms answer checking baseline by exploiting information in multiple reasoning chains to detect potential inconsistencies.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of a diverse R2PE benchmark with 38K instances labeled as true/false across variety of reasoning tasks and LLMs.

- Introduction of PDS that combines implicit answer checking and explicit process supervision across chains, improving F1 by 5.1% over 45 R2PE subsets.

- Demonstration of incorporating PDS into existing verify-and-edit framework to further boost accuracy in open-domain QA.

In summary, the paper establishes a comprehensive benchmark and introduces a novel scoring technique to quantify the relationship between the quality of reasoning chains and correctness of the final predictions generated by LLMs. The analysis and methods open up new directions for enhancing reliability of model outputs.
