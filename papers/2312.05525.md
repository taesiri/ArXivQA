# [You Only Learn One Query: Learning Unified Human Query for Single-Stage   Multi-Person Multi-Task Human-Centric Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Human-centric visual perception tasks like pedestrian detection, pose estimation, segmentation, and attribute analysis are important in applications such as sports analysis, VR/AR. But research has focused on individual tasks, lacking a unified framework for single-stage multi-person multi-task human-centric perception (HCP). Also missing is a benchmark dataset for comprehensive model development and evaluation across these HCP tasks.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces:

1) COCO-UniHuman dataset:
- First large-scale benchmark covering all key HCP tasks - detection, segmentation, pose, attributes 
- Extends COCO annotations with gender and age labels 
- 273K annotated identities across 200K images
- Enables unified model development and evaluation

2) HQNet: Unified single-stage framework 
- Key idea: Learn shared Human Query representations encoding multi-granularity instance-specific features  
- Flexible integration with various backbones like ResNet, Swin, ViT
- Lightweight task heads enable easy scalability
- State-of-the-art on HCP tasks, strong generalization ability  

Main Contributions:

1) COCO-UniHuman benchmark unifying diverse HCP tasks at scale
2) HQNet - simple yet effective baseline for single-stage multi-person multi-task HCP
- Competitive performance vs task-specific models  
- State-of-the-art among multi-task HCP models
- Learnt Human Query shows strong transferability to novel tasks like face detection and tracking

The key novelty is the introduction of a large-scale benchmark for comprehensive evaluation and a strong yet simple baseline framework for unified human perception. The presented approach and analysis help shed light on future research directions for unified human-centric scene understanding.
