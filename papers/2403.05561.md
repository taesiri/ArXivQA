# [Detecting a Proxy for Potential Comorbid ADHD in People Reporting   Anxiety Symptoms from Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Up to 53% of adults with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder. However, patients presenting with anxiety symptoms may be treated for anxiety without their ADHD being considered. This misdiagnosis can lead to inadequate treatment. 

- The goal is to gain insight into the connection between anxiety and ADHD, specifically where ADHD is comorbid with anxiety.

Methodology:
- The authors collected Reddit posts from the Anxiety and ADHD subreddits. They identified a subset of users who posted first in the Anxiety subreddit and later in the ADHD one. 

- This subset acts as a proxy for people presenting anxiety symptoms who later became concerned they may have ADHD.

- Models are trained to classify posts from the Anxiety subreddit into two classes - users who will later post in the ADHD subreddit versus those that do not.

Key Results:
- Keyword based models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) perform poorly on this task (54-59% accuracy)
- A RoBERTa transformer model achieves 76% accuracy, significantly outperforming the baselines.

- This demonstrates there are complex differences between the posting patterns of the two classes that simple keyword models cannot capture.

Contributions:
- Novel task formulation using Reddit data to study connection between anxiety and ADHD
- First demonstration that transformers can make progress on this task
- Way to gain qualitative insight into anxiety-ADHD connection by visualizing classifier predictions

Limitations:
- Biases from Reddit data demographics
- Classifier not intended for diagnosis
