# [DetToolChain: A New Prompting Paradigm to Unleash Detection Ability of   MLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DetToolChain: A New Prompting Paradigm to Unleash Detection Ability of MLLM":

Problem:
Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V and Gemini struggle with precise object detection tasks such as detecting occluded, small, or rotated objects. This significantly limits their applicability to real-world use cases like defect detection and sports analysis. 

Solution: 
The paper proposes DetToolChain, a new prompting paradigm to unlock the object detection potential of MLLMs without needing dataset-specific fine-tuning. DetToolChain has two main components:

1. Detection Prompting Toolkits: Includes intuitive visual prompts leveraging detection priors like rulers, compasses, zooming, splitting images etc. to guide the MLLM's focus and spatial comprehension. Also has detection reasoning prompts to verify predictions using spatial relationships and commonsense knowledge.

2. Detection Chain-of-Thought (Det-CoT): Manages the prompting process by formatting the input, decomposing the task into subtasks, sequentially applying suitable prompts from the toolkit, verifying outputs, and returning final detections.

Key Contributions:

1. A new methodology DetToolChain that transforms MLLMs into highly capable zero-shot detectors using strategic multimodal prompting guided by detection priors and human-like reasoning.

2. Comprehensive detection prompting toolkits with tailored visual and textual prompts targeting specific challenges like occlusion, orientation, small objects etc.

3. A Detection Chain-of-Thought approach to methodically select and apply prompts for progressive refinement of detections.

Results:
DetToolChain provides absolute gains of 20-50% in multiple detection metrics over baseline MLLMs and also sets new state-of-the-art for open vocabulary detection (+21.5% AP50 on Novel Classes), described object detection, and referring expression comprehension, demonstrating its widespread applicability.

The paper delivers an impactful prompting-based technique to unlock formidable detection skills in frozen MLLMs like GPT-4V without any fine-tuning, serving as an easily adaptable and low-cost solution for diverse real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DetToolChain, a new prompting paradigm with detection prompts toolkits and multimodal chain-of-thought to unleash the zero-shot object detection ability of multimodal large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are two-fold:

1. It proposes a new prompting paradigm called DetToolChain to instruct multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V and Gemini to manage object detection. This includes a detection prompting toolkit with visual processing prompts and detection reasoning prompts, as well as a multimodal detection Chain-of-Thought (Det-CoT) to apply these prompts. 

2. It proposes the detection prompting toolkits that include visual processing prompts (e.g. regional amplifier, spatial measurement standard, scene image parser) to facilitate MLLMs on detection tasks, and detection reasoning prompts (e.g. problem insight guider, self-verification promoter) to improve reliability of predictions.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel DetToolChain framework consisting of tailored detection prompts and reasoning instructions that can unleash the zero-shot object detection abilities of large multimodal language models. When using GPT-4V with DetToolChain, the paper shows significant performance gains across tasks like open-vocabulary detection, described object detection and referring expression comprehension.
