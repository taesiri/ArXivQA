# [Probing the Moral Development of Large Language Models through Defining   Issues Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we effectively evaluate and measure the ethical reasoning capabilities and moral development of large language models using psychological assessment tools?

Specifically, the authors propose using the Defining Issues Test (DIT), a tool from moral psychology, to assess the Kohlbergian stages of moral development exhibited by large language models like GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc. 

The key hypothesis appears to be that the DIT framework can be adapted to estimate the moral reasoning sophistication of LLMs by evaluating the types of moral considerations they prioritize when analyzing ethical dilemmas. The authors aim to bridge human psychology and AI by applying this established tool for human moral measurement to advanced AI systems.

In summary, the core research focus is on developing an evaluation methodology grounded in moral psychology to delineate the ethical reasoning abilities and stages of moral development demonstrated by modern large language models. The DIT serves as the primary instrument they utilize to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing an evaluation framework based on the Defining Issues Test (DIT) from moral psychology to assess the ethical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 

2. Establishing a connection between the fields of human psychology and AI by applying a tool used to study moral development in humans (DIT) to evaluate AI systems.

3. Conducting experiments to estimate the Kohlbergian stages of moral development that prominent LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT v1, ChatGPT v2, and LLamaChat-70B operate at using the DIT framework. 

4. Calculating metrics like the P-score, stage-wise scores, and schema scores to quantify the moral reasoning demonstrated by these LLMs.

5. Comparing the moral development levels achieved by different LLMs based on the DIT evaluation.

6. Providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in ethical reasoning and judgment. 

7. Demonstrating how tools and concepts from moral philosophy/psychology can be useful for responsible and ethical AI research.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and implementing a novel evaluation methodology for assessing the moral development of AI systems by adapting an established framework from psychology. This helps bridge human and artificial intelligence in an important aspect of ethics and values.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on evaluating the ethical reasoning capabilities of large language models:

- The use of the Defining Issues Test (DIT) framework is a novel approach in this field. Most prior work has focused on classification-based evaluations or collecting purpose-built ethical datasets. Using an established psychological assessment tool like the DIT provides a more nuanced way to benchmark the moral development stages of LLMs.

- Mapping LLMs to Kohlberg's stages of moral development is an insightful way to situate their capabilities relative to human cognition. This aligns with the goal of developing models that can make ethical judgments adaptable to diverse contexts, rather than imposing a single value system.

- The curation of new moral dilemmas covering non-Western scenarios is a useful contribution. Many critics have pointed out the Western cultural bias in the original DIT. The new dilemmas help address this limitation and expand the DIT's cross-cultural applicability.

- The large-scale evaluation across multiple models provides useful comparative insights. The model-wise observations highlight relative strengths and weaknesses in moral reasoning, and track progress from older models like GPT-3 to latest ones like GPT-4.

- The stage-wise score analysis gives granular insights beyond the aggregate P-score. Breaking down performance by Kohlberg's stages could help diagnose which aspects of moral development need improvement in future work.

Overall, I think this paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing literature on evaluating and improving the ethical capabilities of LLMs. The novel application of the DIT is a creative approach compared to prior work. The cross-model analysis also provides useful comparative insights. Expanding the methodology to even more diverse contexts and dilemmas could further enrich this line of research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Expanding the evaluation to more diverse dilemmas and larger models. The authors used a limited set of moral dilemmas and evaluated only a handful of LLMs. Testing on a wider range of dilemmas and latest LLMs like PaLM, Bloom, etc. could provide further insights. 

- Incorporating additional metrics beyond P-score to capture different facets of moral reasoning. The authors mainly relied on P-score but other indices like N2 score, Human Subjectivity score etc. could reveal more nuances.

- Comparing LLMs against human performance on the DIT test. The authors benchmark LLMs against each other but comparing them to actual human responses could better contextualize the capabilities and limitations.

- Training and fine-tuning LLMs explicitly on moral reasoning datasets before evaluation. The pretrained LLMs may exhibit biases, so targeted training could improve moral judgment.

- Developing modified DIT scenarios tailored to AI systems and capabilities. The original DIT focuses heavily on human contexts, custom dilemmas for AI agents could be more relevant.

- Testing cross-cultural and multilingual validity of the framework. The authors acknowledge the Western bias of DIT - evaluating models trained on non-English data could help.

- Correlating DIT performance with downstream task performance involving ethics. Testing if higher DIT scores translate to ethical behavior in real applications.

- Using insights to improve training objectives and architectures of LLMs. The evaluation could inform building morally aligned LLMs.

In summary, the authors lay out an initial framework but highlight several promising areas for extending this research on evaluating and improving the moral capabilities of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using the Defining Issues Test (DIT) framework from moral psychology to evaluate the ethical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The DIT is based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development stages and assesses an individual's level of moral judgment. The authors designed prompts containing ethical dilemmas and value statements adapted from the DIT. They evaluated LLMs including GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPTv1, ChatGPTv2, and LLamaChat-70B by sequentially asking them three questions about the dilemmas and ranking the importance of value statements. The models' responses were scored to determine their Principled Morality Score (P-score) indicating the level of post-conventional moral reasoning. The results showed substantial differences between models, with GPT-3 and Text-davinci-002 performing poorly while GPT-4, ChatGPTv1, and LlamaChat achieved higher P-scores corresponding to post-conventional stages. The framework provides insights into LLMs' moral development stages and judgment capabilities. Applying tools from moral psychology can be an effective approach to evaluate and understand the ethical reasoning of AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using the Defining Issues Test (DIT) framework to assess the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The DIT is a psychological assessment tool grounded in Kohlberg's theory of moral development stages. It presents ethical dilemmas and asks participants to rate and rank the importance of various statements related to the dilemma. The DIT scores allow estimation of the stage of moral reasoning an individual operates at. 

The authors adapted the DIT for LLMs by designing prompts containing an ethical dilemma and associated value statements. The models are asked to answer questions about resolving the dilemma and ranking the most important value considerations. By analyzing the responses, the authors computed DIT metrics like the P-score and stage scores to quantify the models' moral development levels. Experiments with models like GPT-3, ChatGPT, Text-davinci, and LLaMA indicate significant variation in ethical reasoning, with GPT-4 and LLaMA-70B demonstrating more sophisticated moral judgment. The work illustrates the promise of using frameworks like the DIT to evaluate and enhance the moral capabilities of LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using the Defining Issues Test (DIT), a psychometric tool from moral psychology, to evaluate the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The DIT is based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development stages and aims to measure the conceptual frameworks used by individuals to analyze moral dilemmas. The authors adapted the DIT for LLMs by designing moral dilemmas with corresponding value statements, and prompting the models with questions to rate and rank the importance of the statements. The models' responses were scored using the DIT metrics like P-score and stage scores to estimate the LLM's level of moral development according to Kohlberg's stages. The DIT framework was tested on several prominent LLMs including GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. This novel approach of applying concepts from moral psychology allowed comparative assessment of the LLMs' capacities for ethical reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem/question being addressed is:

How to effectively evaluate the ethical reasoning capabilities and stages of moral development of large language models (LLMs) using a psychological framework. 

The authors note that while there has been lots of interest in understanding the reasoning abilities of LLMs, there is still a gap in properly evaluating their moral development and ethical judgment. Existing approaches that frame ethics as a classification task have limitations. 

So the authors propose using a framework from psychology - the Defining Issues Test (DIT) - to assess the Kohlbergian stages of moral development that LLMs operate at. The DIT is rooted in moral philosophy/psychology and provides a more nuanced way to analyze how models make ethical decisions.

The key research questions seem to be:

- Can the DIT framework be effectively adapted to evaluate the moral reasoning of LLMs?

- What stages of Kohlberg's moral development do prominent LLMs like GPT-3/GPT-4, ChatGPT, etc. reside at based on their responses to ethical dilemmas using the DIT?

- How do different LLMs compare in their moral development stages based on DIT evaluation?

So in summary, the paper is trying to address the issue of properly evaluating the moral reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging a psychological assessment tool (DIT). The goal is to gain insights into the ethical maturity of different state-of-the-art models.
