# [Just Ask: Learning to Answer Questions from Millions of Narrated Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00451)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is: 

How can we develop an approach to train video question answering (VideoQA) models without requiring a large amount of manually annotated visual data?

The key points are:

- Current VideoQA models rely on training datasets of video-question-answer triplets that are costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. This limits their performance.

- The authors propose a method to automatically generate a large-scale VideoQA training dataset by leveraging cross-modal supervision and transformer models trained on text-only QA data. 

- Their approach applies the text QA models to narrated videos to generate video-question-answer triplets, creating a dataset of 69M examples.

- They show this automatic generation approach allows training a VideoQA model that achieves state-of-the-art results by pretraining on their generated dataset and finetuning on existing benchmarks.

- Their method removes the need for manually annotated visual data during training, enabling large-scale VideoQA training.

So in summary, the core research question is how to train VideoQA models without relying on large manually annotated visual datasets, which they address through automatic generation of training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an approach to automatically generate a large-scale video question answering (VideoQA) dataset, called HowToVQA69M. The key points are:

- They propose a method to generate video-question-answer triplets from narrated videos using cross-modal supervision. Specifically, they leverage transformer models trained on text-only question-answering data to generate questions and answers from the speech transcripts of narrated instructional videos. 

- Applying this approach to 1.2M videos from HowTo100M dataset, they create HowToVQA69M, which contains 69M video-question-answer triplets. This is two orders of magnitude larger than existing VideoQA datasets.

- To handle the diverse open-ended answers, they introduce a training procedure using contrastive learning between a video-question transformer and an answer transformer. This allows scaling to the large vocabulary of answers.

- They show strong zero-shot VideoQA results without using any manually annotated visual data during training, demonstrating the generalization of their approach.

- Finetuning their model pretrained on HowToVQA69M leads to new state-of-the-art results on several downstream VideoQA datasets including MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA.

- They also introduce a new VideoQA benchmark dataset called iVQA with manually verified questions and multiple annotated answers per question, for detailed evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is an automatic approach to generate large-scale training data for open-ended VideoQA and models that leverage this data to advance the state of the art on multiple VideoQA benchmarks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in video question answering:

- Dataset scale: This paper introduces a new large-scale automatically generated dataset called HowToVQA69M with 69 million video-question-answer triplets. This dataset is much larger than previous video QA datasets, exceeding others by two orders of magnitude.

- Data generation method: The authors propose a novel way of generating large-scale video QA data automatically from narrated videos using transformer models trained on text QA data. This avoids the need for expensive manual annotation. Previous video QA datasets relied on limited manual annotation.

- Open vocabulary: The proposed method can handle a large open vocabulary of over 16 million answers. Previous video QA methods were limited to small predefined answer vocabularies (typically <5K answers).

- Zero-shot learning: This paper demonstrates zero-shot video QA by training only on their generated HowToVQA69M data without finetuning on any downstream datasets. This evaluates the generalization of the model to new datasets.

- State-of-the-art results: The model achieves new state-of-the-art results when finetuned on several existing video QA benchmarks including MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA.

- Reduced language bias: A new manually annotated iVQA benchmark is introduced to evaluate video QA with reduced language biases, requiring watching the video to answer questions.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of video QA research especially in terms of dataset scale, open vocabulary, zero-shot learning and state-of-the-art downstream task performance. The automatic data generation and new benchmark also contribute to progress in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling up their approach by generating even larger training datasets using their automated VideoQA generation method. They suggest that generating additional training data can lead to further improvements, as shown in their ablation studies.

- Extending their method to new domains beyond instructional videos. The authors mention that generating training data for other video domains could improve performance on datasets from those domains.

- Investigating other self-supervised objectives and architectures for their video-question and answer encoders. The authors proposed a contrastive learning approach in this work, but other self-supervised techniques could potentially be explored.

- Exploring semi-supervised learning techniques to make use of unlabeled videos during training. The authors currently only use automatically generated labeled VideoQA data, but leveraging unlabeled videos could help as well.

- Developing more challenging VideoQA evaluation benchmarks to continue pushing progress in this area. The authors introduced a new benchmark to reduce language biases, but developing more benchmarks that require complex visual reasoning could further advance the field.

- Applying their automated VideoQA data generation approach to other modalities like images or embodied environments. The core idea of leveraging cross-modal supervision and language models could potentially generalize.

So in summary, the main future directions are scaling up the data generation, extending the approach to new domains and modalities, developing better learning methods like semi-supervised or self-supervised techniques, and creating more challenging benchmarks to continue driving progress in video question answering.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach for automatically generating large-scale training data for video question answering (VideoQA) without the need for manual annotation. The key idea is to leverage readily available narrated instructional videos paired with speech transcripts, such as from the HowTo100M dataset. First, transformer models trained on text-only question-answering data are used to extract question-answer pairs from the video narrations. Then, these question-answer pairs are aligned with short video clips from the corresponding narrated videos to form video-question-answer triplets. By applying this approach to 1.2 million HowTo100M videos, a new dataset called HowToVQA69M is generated, containing 69 million diverse video-question-answer triplets. The paper shows that pretraining a VideoQA model on this automatically generated dataset, followed by finetuning on existing VideoQA benchmarks, substantially improves performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially for rare answers. Additionally, a new manually annotated VideoQA benchmark called iVQA is introduced to enable more rigorous evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method to automatically generate a large-scale dataset for video question answering (VideoQA). The key idea is to leverage cross-modal supervision by using language models trained on text-only question-answering data to generate video-question-answer triplets from videos paired with transcribed narrations. Specifically, the authors use transformer models trained for answer extraction and question generation on the SQuAD dataset to analyze sentences extracted from narrations of instructional videos in the HowTo100M dataset. This results in a new dataset called HowToVQA with over 69 million diverse video-question-answer triplets, exceeding previous VideoQA datasets by two orders of magnitude. 

To handle the open vocabulary of answers, the authors propose a training approach based on contrastive learning between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer transformer. Experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot results on existing benchmarks, indicating the generalization of models trained on the automatically generated data. Furthermore, finetuning on target datasets significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA. The authors also introduce a new manually annotated dataset, iVQA, for detailed evaluation of visual grounding in VideoQA. Overall, this work presents a scalable approach to generate large training data for VideoQA without expensive manual annotation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to automatically generate a large-scale video question answering (VideoQA) dataset from readily available narrated videos. The key idea is to leverage existing transformer-based language models trained on a text question-answering corpus to generate video-question-answer triplets from the speech transcripts of narrated instructional videos. Specifically, they first train an answer extractor and a question generator on a text QA dataset. They then apply these models to sentences extracted from video narrations to produce QA pairs related to the video content. By generating 69 million diverse QA pairs from 1.2 million narrated videos, they create a VideoQA dataset called HowToVQA69M that is two orders of magnitude larger than prior datasets. They further propose a VideoQA model trained on this dataset using contrastive learning between a multi-modal video-question encoder and an answer encoder. Experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer and state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on existing VideoQA benchmarks.
