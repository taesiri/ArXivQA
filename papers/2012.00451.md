# [Just Ask: Learning to Answer Questions from Millions of Narrated Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00451)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it aims to address is: 

How can we develop an approach to train video question answering (VideoQA) models without requiring a large amount of manually annotated visual data?

The key points are:

- Current VideoQA models rely on training datasets of video-question-answer triplets that are costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. This limits their performance.

- The authors propose a method to automatically generate a large-scale VideoQA training dataset by leveraging cross-modal supervision and transformer models trained on text-only QA data. 

- Their approach applies the text QA models to narrated videos to generate video-question-answer triplets, creating a dataset of 69M examples.

- They show this automatic generation approach allows training a VideoQA model that achieves state-of-the-art results by pretraining on their generated dataset and finetuning on existing benchmarks.

- Their method removes the need for manually annotated visual data during training, enabling large-scale VideoQA training.

So in summary, the core research question is how to train VideoQA models without relying on large manually annotated visual datasets, which they address through automatic generation of training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an approach to automatically generate a large-scale video question answering (VideoQA) dataset, called HowToVQA69M. The key points are:

- They propose a method to generate video-question-answer triplets from narrated videos using cross-modal supervision. Specifically, they leverage transformer models trained on text-only question-answering data to generate questions and answers from the speech transcripts of narrated instructional videos. 

- Applying this approach to 1.2M videos from HowTo100M dataset, they create HowToVQA69M, which contains 69M video-question-answer triplets. This is two orders of magnitude larger than existing VideoQA datasets.

- To handle the diverse open-ended answers, they introduce a training procedure using contrastive learning between a video-question transformer and an answer transformer. This allows scaling to the large vocabulary of answers.

- They show strong zero-shot VideoQA results without using any manually annotated visual data during training, demonstrating the generalization of their approach.

- Finetuning their model pretrained on HowToVQA69M leads to new state-of-the-art results on several downstream VideoQA datasets including MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA.

- They also introduce a new VideoQA benchmark dataset called iVQA with manually verified questions and multiple annotated answers per question, for detailed evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is an automatic approach to generate large-scale training data for open-ended VideoQA and models that leverage this data to advance the state of the art on multiple VideoQA benchmarks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in video question answering:

- Dataset scale: This paper introduces a new large-scale automatically generated dataset called HowToVQA69M with 69 million video-question-answer triplets. This dataset is much larger than previous video QA datasets, exceeding others by two orders of magnitude.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach for automatically generating large-scale training data for video question answering (VideoQA) without the need for manual annotation. The key idea is to leverage readily available narrated instructional videos paired with speech transcripts, such as from the HowTo100M dataset. First, transformer models trained on text-only question-answering data are used to extract question-answer pairs from the video narrations. Then, these question-answer pairs are aligned with short video clips from the corresponding narrated videos to form video-question-answer triplets. By applying this approach to 1.2 million HowTo100M videos, a new dataset called HowToVQA69M is generated, containing 69 million diverse video-question-answer triplets. The paper shows that pretraining a VideoQA model on this automatically generated dataset, followed by finetuning on existing VideoQA benchmarks, substantially improves performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially for rare answers. Additionally, a new manually annotated VideoQA benchmark called iVQA is introduced to enable more rigorous evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method to automatically generate a large-scale dataset for video question answering (VideoQA). The key idea is to leverage cross-modal supervision by using language models trained on text-only question-answering data to generate video-question-answer triplets from videos paired with transcribed narrations. Specifically, the authors use transformer models trained for answer extraction and question generation on the SQuAD dataset to analyze sentences extracted from narrations of instructional videos in the HowTo100M dataset. This results in a new dataset called HowToVQA with over 69 million diverse video-question-answer triplets, exceeding previous VideoQA datasets by two orders of magnitude. 

To handle the open vocabulary of answers, the authors propose a training approach based on contrastive learning between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer transformer. Experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot results on existing benchmarks, indicating the generalization of models trained on the automatically generated data. Furthermore, finetuning on target datasets significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA. The authors also introduce a new manually annotated dataset, iVQA, for detailed evaluation of visual grounding in VideoQA.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to automatically generate a large-scale video question answering (VideoQA) dataset from readily available narrated videos. The key idea is to leverage transformers trained on text-only question answering data to generate question-answer pairs from speech transcripts of narrated videos. Specifically, the authors use a question generation transformer and an answer extraction transformer trained on SQuAD to generate questions and answers from sentences in the speech transcripts of the HowTo100M narrated instructional video dataset. This results in a new dataset called HowToVQA69M with 69 million video-question-answer triplets, two orders of magnitude larger than existing VideoQA datasets. 

To handle the open vocabulary of diverse answers, the authors propose a VideoQA model based on contrastive learning between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer transformer. This allows matching to free-form answers instead of being limited to a predefined answer vocabulary. The model is first pretrained on the generated HowToVQA69M dataset, then finetuned on downstream VideoQA datasets.

Experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot performance on multiple benchmarks without any visual supervision, significantly outperforming prior work. The model also establishes new state-of-the-art results when finetuned on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA datasets. Finally, the authors introduce a new manually annotated VideoQA dataset, iVQA, for reduced language bias and multiple ground truth answers per question.

In summary, the key contributions are: (i) automatic large-scale VideoQA data generation from narrated videos; (ii) a pretrained VideoQA model with contrastive learning between video-question and answer for open vocabularies; (iii) state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks; (iv) a new VideoQA dataset iVQA with multiple answers per question.
