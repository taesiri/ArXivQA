# [Keeping Up with the Language Models: Robustness-Bias Interplay in NLI   Data and Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12620)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we systematically expand and improve existing bias auditing benchmarks for natural language models to keep pace with rapid advances in model capabilities?

Specifically, the authors focus on expanding the recently introduced BBNLI benchmark for evaluating model bias in natural language inference. Their goal is to create a more challenging version of BBNLI that is better able to uncover biases in state-of-the-art NLI models. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- They propose using language models like BERT to generate lexical variations of hypotheses in BBNLI, and filtering them with adversarial techniques to identify the most challenging samples. This allows rapid expansion of the benchmark with minimal human effort.

- They introduce a new expanded benchmark called BBNLI-NEXT with 14.5K samples, compared to 2.3K in original BBNLI. Experiments show BBNLI-NEXT is much more challenging and uncovers more bias.

- They analyze model errors and propose new disaggregate counterfactual bias measures to distinguish between model brittleness vs intrinsic bias. 

- They demonstrate an approach to rapidly adapt bias benchmarks to stay relevant as models advance, while preserving validity via human oversight.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that existing bias benchmarks can be systematically expanded in an adversarial way to create more challenging versions that better reveal biases in evolving state-of-the-art NLP models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an approach to systematically extend an existing natural language inference (NLI) bias benchmark (BBNLI) to create a more challenging version called BBNLI-NEXT. This is done by leveraging masked language models to generate lexical variations of the hypothesis sentences while preserving their semantics and intent. The most challenging samples are selected using adversarial filtering.

2. It introduces the BBNLI-NEXT dataset, which is shown to be much more challenging than the original BBNLI. On average, BBNLI-NEXT reduces the accuracy of fine-tuned NLI models from 95.7% on BBNLI down to 58.7%.

3. It points out issues with the aggregate bias score used in BBNLI, which combines pro- and anti-stereotypical biases into one number. The paper argues this can obscure important details and proposes new disaggregate counterfactual bias measures.

4. It analyzes the interplay between robustness and bias in NLI models using the BBNLI-NEXT dataset. The disaggregate measures help attribute model errors to bias versus brittleness/lack of robustness. 

5. More broadly, it demonstrates an approach to rapidly evolve bias benchmarks to keep up with improving language models, while maintaining rigor, transparency, and construct validity. The overall goal is to better understand model biases so they can be addressed.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing the BBNLI-NEXT benchmark, disaggregate bias measures, and analysis illuminating the robustness-bias relationship in state-of-the-art NLI models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using language models to systematically expand an existing natural language inference benchmark for auditing unwanted social bias in models, enabling the creation of a more challenging dataset that uncovers more bias, and introduces new bias measures that distinguish between model robustness and bias.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research:

- It builds directly on the recently published BBNLI dataset for evaluating social bias in language models. The authors identify some limitations with BBNLI and propose extensions to make it more challenging. 

- Most prior work has focused on measuring aggregate bias, while this paper argues for the importance of analyzing pro-stereotype and anti-stereotype bias separately. The disaggregate counterfactual measures introduced here are a novel way to differentiate bias from model brittleness.

- The idea of using the models themselves (via masking and adversarial filtering) to rapidly evolve challenging bias benchmarks is creative. It establishes a feedback loop between model development and auditing.

- Many recent bias evaluation datasets are based on simpler synthetic templates. A strength of this work is leveraging real-world premises from BBNLI to generate more naturalistic hypotheses through language model masking.

- The analysis examines bias issues specifically for the task of natural language inference. Much related work looks at intrinsic social bias in word embeddings or generative text, not grounded in a particular task.

- The dataset is focused on English language and biases relevant to US culture. Many papers have studied bias in other languages and cultural contexts. The methods could be adapted, but the dataset itself is geared for English NLP.

Overall, this paper makes nice contributions in advancing bias measurement methodology and benchmark construction for an important NLP task. The focus on model robustness and distinguishing error types is novel. The techniques build nicely on prior art like BBNLI while proposing impactful new directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Expand the methodology to create challenging bias auditing datasets for other NLP tasks beyond just NLI. The approach of using masks and adversarial filtering could potentially work for many other tasks.

- Apply the methodology to extend bias auditing datasets to cover different cultural contexts beyond just US-centric biases. The authors note their work only deals with certain US-centric biases, but the overall approach could apply more broadly.

- Use the generated benchmarks to further study the interplay between model brittleness and bias. The authors introduce new proposed measures to try to separate brittleness and bias, but more research is needed here.

- Find ways to use models themselves to help validate some of the machine-generated hypotheses, rather than relying solely on time-consuming manual validation. The authors note this is a complex issue but worthy of further exploration.

- Conduct further research into understanding and improving the robustness of NLI models. The authors find brittleness remains a primary issue, so robustness could help address some of the biases.

- Provide more incentives for researchers to take on the challenging and multi-disciplinary work involved in bias auditing of models. More effort and focus in this area is needed.

- Consider more complex definitions of bias that go beyond binary gender or limited racial categories. Intersectionality and other factors should be addressed.

- Combine machine-generated hypotheses with more human-crafted samples to help improve balance of datasets. Both approaches have pros and cons.

Overall, the authors laid out a promising approach but noted substantially more research across disciplines is needed to further improve bias auditing and mitigation in NLP models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using language models themselves to help construct challenging bias auditing datasets for natural language inference. They start with an existing bias benchmark (BBNLI) and use masked language models to generate lexical variations of the hypotheses while preserving semantics. The generated samples are filtered adversarially to keep only challenging ones. This process results in a larger and more difficult dataset called BBNLI-NEXT. Experiments show BBNLI-NEXT reduces model accuracy substantially compared to BBNLI, indicating it is more effective at uncovering bias. The paper also critiques the original BBNLI aggregate bias score for obscuring important details and proposes new disaggregate counterfactual bias measures to distinguish model brittleness from actual bias. Overall, the work demonstrates an approach to rapidly expand bias benchmarks as language models evolve, while carefully validating to avoid construct validity issues. It also elucidates the subtle interplay between robustness and bias in model auditing.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to create challenging bias auditing datasets for natural language inference by enlisting the help of language models themselves. The authors start with an existing bias auditing benchmark for NLI called BBNLI and systematically modify the hypotheses using masked language models to generate lexical variations. The resulting samples are filtered adversarially to select only difficult cases and validated manually. This process results in a significantly expanded and more challenging dataset called BBNLI-NEXT with over 14K samples. Experiments with multiple NLI models show BBNLI-NEXT reduces accuracy from 95% on BBNLI to 58% on average, demonstrating it exposes more model bias. 

The paper also analyzes model errors on BBNLI-NEXT in more depth using proposed disaggregate counterfactual bias measures. These measures separate errors into pro-stereotype bias, anti-stereotype bias and model errors insensitive to social groups. The analysis reveals interesting insights about the interplay between model robustness and bias. The authors argue proper attribution of error causes is important and can help make models more fair. Overall, the work demonstrates an approach to rapidly expand bias auditing benchmarks as models evolve by leveraging models themselves and highlights the need to disentangle model brittleness from bias.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes extending an existing natural language inference (NLI) bias benchmark dataset (BBNLI) by leveraging language models to generate challenging lexical variations of the original hypothesis templates. Specifically, they create masked versions of the original templates and use a masked LM to fill in the masks and generate variant hypotheses. These new hypothesis variations are filtered adversarially by only keeping samples that are mispredicted by NLI models, in order to create a more difficult bias benchmark dataset. The resulting dataset (\bbnlinew) with 14.5K samples is shown to be substantially more challenging than the original BBNLI, reducing NLI model accuracy from 95.7\% on BBNLI to 58.7\% on average. The paper also analyzes model errors on \bbnlinew using proposed disaggregate counterfactual bias measures that aim to separate out model brittleness from bias. Overall, the main method is using language models and adversarial filtering to systematically extend an existing bias benchmark and construct a more challenging dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my review, the key points of the paper are:

- Auditing language models for unwanted social bias is challenging, especially as models rapidly evolve. Existing bias benchmarks can quickly become obsolete.

- The paper proposes an approach to create more challenging bias auditing datasets by enlisting the help of language models themselves. They start with an existing NLI bias benchmark (BBNLI) and use masked LMs to generate lexical variations of the hypotheses that are more difficult for NLI models.

- This allows the creation of a larger and more challenging benchmark dataset called BBNLI-NEXT with limited manual effort. Experiments show BBNLI-NEXT reduces accuracy of NLI models substantially compared to original BBNLI, uncovering more bias.

- The paper argues that commonly used aggregate bias scores can be problematic, as they combine pro- and anti-stereotypical biases into one number. Disaggregate counterfactual bias measures are proposed instead.

- Analysis using the new measures reveals interesting insights into different types of model errors - bias versus brittleness. This demonstrates the importance of carefully attributing causes of errors in bias auditing.

- The work emphasizes the need for rapidly expanding benchmarks to keep pace with evolving models. It also highlights the interplay between robustness and bias that requires more research.

In summary, the key focus is on developing improved bias auditing methods and benchmarks for language models, especially as models continue to advance rapidly. A core idea is leveraging models themselves to accelerate benchmark creation and make datasets more challenging.
