# [Quality Does Matter: A Detailed Look at the Quality and Utility of   Web-Mined Parallel Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Web-mined parallel corpora can help alleviate data scarcity issues for low-resource neural machine translation (NMT), but they are known to have serious quality issues. 
- Prior work has only examined small random samples from these datasets to determine quality, which does not give an accurate picture.

Approach:
- Analyzed web-mined parallel corpora for English-Sinhala, English-Tamil and Sinhala-Tamil.
- Ranked sentences in each corpus by similarity score using LASER embeddings. Extracted top 25k, bottom 25k and random 25k splits.  
- Improved prior taxonomy for human evaluation, had native speakers evaluate 250 samples from each split.
- Trained NMT models on different splits to test impact on quality. Also manually cleaned a portion of top split and evaluated.

Key Findings:
- Quality varies hugely across splits - top rated sentences had 46-98% correct translations while bottom rated ones had 0-16%. 
- Quality also varied significantly across languages/datasets. Non-English Sinhala-Tamil was best.
- NMT models trained on top splits performed far better than bottom or random splits. Some even matched performance of human-curated datasets.  
- Manually cleaning further improved performance but gains were small compared to human effort required.

Main Contributions:
- Showed mistaken assumptions in prior work about consistency of web-mined corpus quality
- Detailed intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation quantifying quality variations across splits and languages
- Demonstrated top splits can match human-curated datasets for low-resource NMT even without cleaning
- Caution against spending effort blindly cleaning these datasets without analysis

The key insight is that quality varies greatly within web-mined corpora and highest quality portions can be very useful if extracted properly. This allows better utilization of these datasets for low-resource languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper shows that analyzing only a small random portion of large web-mined parallel corpora can be misleading about their overall quality, and selecting the highest quality subset can yield neural machine translation performance on par with human-curated datasets for some low-resource languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the quality and utility of web-mined parallel corpora for low-resource languages. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that the quality of web-mined corpora varies significantly across different portions of the same corpus. Analyzing just a small random sample can be misleading.

2) The paper demonstrates that using only the highest quality portion (top 25k sentences) of some web-mined corpora can yield neural machine translation performance on par with human-curated datasets.

3) The paper finds that further manual cleaning of the top portion of web-mined corpora does improve quality and translation performance, but the gains may not justify the required human effort. 

4) The paper cautions researchers against blindly using web-mined corpora without studying their quality distribution, and calls for more language-specific analysis of such corpora.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous quality analysis of web-mined corpora that gives practical guidance to researchers on effectively utilizing such corpora for low-resource neural machine translation.

The paper conducts a detailed analysis on the quality of web-mined parallel corpora for low-resource languages like Sinhala and Tamil. It performs both intrinsic (human) evaluation and extrinsic (NMT) evaluation on different portions of ranked web-mined corpora. It also examines the impact of using different embedding techniques for ranking the corpus. Finally, it studies the effect of manually cleaning a web-mined corpus on subsequent NMT performance. The key terms above summarize the main topics and contributions of this research paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that previous work analyzing web-mined corpora quality uses too small of a random sample. How does the choice of sample size impact the conclusions that can be drawn about overall corpus quality? What considerations should go into determining an appropriate sample size?

2. The paper proposes ranking corpus pairs by similarity scores and analyzing top/bottom portions rather than just a random sample. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to random sampling? How does it impact the generalizability of findings? 

3. The taxonomy for annotating errors is more fine-grained than in previous work. What additional insights does this level of granularity provide? How might it inform decisions about corpus cleaning and utility?

4. Corpus cleaning only provided modest gains in MT quality compared to the effort required. How could cost/benefit analysis be incorporated into decisions about cleaning web-mined corpora? What factors should be considered?

5. Results find the quality of top-ranked portions can exceed human-curated datasets. What explanations could account for this? Does it reveal limitations in human curation or issues with automatic similarity metrics?

6. There is significant variance in quality across languages and datasets. What properties of languages or web-mined corpora might account for this variance? How can it be addressed?  

7. Certain corpora contain high proportions of religious texts. How might this impact domain bias? What steps could be taken during mining or cleaning to increase diversity?

8. The paper analyzes only a small number of languages. How might findings generalize to other low/mid/high-resource languages? What open questions remain?

9. Could findings on web-mined corpus utility be incorporated into refined similarity metrics or confidence estimates for mining pipelines? What would this require?

10. Results suggest peaks in MT quality at certain corpus sizes. What explanations could account for this pattern? How might optimal training set size be determined for new languages?
