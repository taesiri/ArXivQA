# [Nearly Minimax Optimal Regret for Learning Linear Mixture Stochastic   Shortest Path](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem with a linear mixture transition model. In an SSP, an agent interacts with a stochastic environment to try to reach a goal state while minimizing cumulative cost. The paper considers the setting where the unknown transition probabilities are modeled as a linear function of some feature mappings. Prior algorithms for this problem often make restrictive assumptions like lower bounds on costs or upper bounds on episode lengths. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new algorithm called LEVIS++ that eliminates these restrictive assumptions. The key ideas are:

1) Use extended value iteration with a fine-grained confidence set on the model parameters. The confidence set is constructed using multiple weighted linear regressions on different order moments of the value function. 

2) The weights for the regressions are designed to be variance-aware and uncertainty-aware. The variance terms are estimated recursively from the higher order moments. The uncertainty-aware terms help eliminate dependence on cost lower bounds.

3) Trigger value function updates when the determinant of the covariance matrix doubles for any of the moment orders. This allows more accurate estimates.

Main Contributions:

1) The algorithm achieves an Õ(dB_*√K) regret bound that matches the lower bound proven in prior work, up to logs. This suggests the algorithm is nearly minimax optimal. 

2) To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first statistically near optimal algorithm for linear mixture SSPs.

3) The technique of using fine-grained confidence sets based on higher order moments could be applicable more broadly in reinforcement learning.

4) The variance and uncertainty aware weight design also seems more widely useful for obtaining sharper bounds.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in developing an optimal algorithm for an important RL problem, using some novel analysis techniques that could have broader impact.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a nearly minimax optimal algorithm for the stochastic shortest path problem with linear transition dynamics by using an extended value iteration method with fine-grained, variance-aware confidence sets constructed through estimating higher-order moments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper proposes a novel algorithm called LEVIS^{++} for learning linear mixture stochastic shortest path (SSP) models. 

2. The regret bound achieved by LEVIS^{++} is $\tilde{O}(dB_* \sqrt{K})$, which nearly matches the lower bound of $\Omega(dB_*\sqrt{K})$ for linear mixture SSPs up to logarithmic factors. This suggests LEVIS^{++} is nearly minimax optimal. 

3. Compared to prior algorithms like LEVIS+, LEVIS^{++} eliminates the polynomial dependency on problem parameters like the minimum cost $c_{\text{min}}$ or expected optimal length $T_*$ in the regret bound. This is done through techniques like variance-aware and uncertainty-aware weighted regression and more refined variance estimators based on high-order moments.

4. To the best of the authors' knowledge, LEVIS^{++} is the first statistically near-optimal algorithm for learning stochastic shortest path problems with linear function approximation.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an improved algorithm that achieves the first near-optimal regret bound for linear mixture SSPs, eliminating undesirable dependencies on problem parameters.

The paper studies the problem of stochastic shortest path (SSP) with linear function approximation, where the goal is to reach a target state while minimizing cumulative cost. Key aspects include proposing an algorithm based on extended value iteration with variance-aware confidence sets, achieving an near optimal regret bound that matches known lower bounds, and eliminating restrictive assumptions on cost function lower bounds or length upper bounds compared to prior works.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new algorithm called LEVIS++ for learning linear mixture stochastic shortest path problems. Can you explain in detail the key differences in the design of LEVIS++ compared to previous algorithms like LEVIS+? What specific techniques were introduced to eliminate restrictive assumptions made in prior work?

2. The paper mentions employing both variance-aware and uncertainty-aware weights in the weighted regression used to estimate the model parameters. Can you elaborate on why this is an important contribution? How do these carefully designed weights help improve the final regret bound?  

3. The high-order moment variance estimator is a key technical contribution of this work. Can you walk through how this estimator works in detail and why it leads to a more accurate estimate of the value function variance?

4. The paper proves a nearly minimax optimal regret bound of ~O(dB_*√K). What is the significance of matching the lower bound regret for this problem setting? Under what conditions does the bound hold and what assumptions are made?

5. How does the analysis of the DEVI subroutine relate to proving the overall regret guarantee? What key properties need to be shown regarding the output of DEVI?

6. Walk through the regret decomposition provided in Lemma 3. How is this decomposition used in the later analysis and which terms are most important to bound?

7. Explain the significance of Lemma 7 and how bounding the termsRl, Sl, and Al leads to the final regret result. What is the intuition behind connecting these terms?  

8. The paper provides both a result for the case when c_min is known (Theorem 1) and when only T* is known (Theorem 2). Compare these two cases and explain how the perturbation idea is used when c_min is unknown.

9. From a practical standpoint, discuss the computational complexity of implementing the LEVIS++ algorithm. What are the most expensive computational steps?

10. The regret bound has a horizon-free dependence on the episode length K but still depends on B_*. Can you discuss potential ways the analysis could be strengthened to eliminate dependence on B_* as well? What techniques could help achieve that?
