## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Modeling and control of heavy-duty parallel-serial manipulators composed of parallel mechanisms and serial chains is important for industrial applications like forestry, construction, and mining. 
- Existing methods either use complex numerical techniques or do not provide fully analytical solutions for efficiently computing forward dynamics.
- Forward dynamics is needed for model predictive control and trajectory optimization methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a new geometric and recursive algorithm to analytically compute forward dynamics of heavy-duty parallel-serial manipulators.
- The key ideas are:
  - Express dynamics of parallel mechanisms in a lower dimensional dual Lie algebra to find analytical solution for inverse dynamics.
  - Apply articulated-body inertias method to derive linear, scalar expression for actuator acceleration and assembled inertias.
  - Formulate explicit recursive algorithm with complexity O(n) for forward dynamics of serial-parallel manipulators.

Main Contributions:
- Analytical solution for total wrench exerted at linear actuator's frame of a parallel mechanism.
- Closed-form formula for computing linear acceleration of actuator as a function of force on it.
- Expressions for assembled inertia matrix and wrench bias acting on base frame of parallel mechanism.
- Complete recursive algorithm for forward dynamics of multi-DOF parallel-serial manipulators composed of parallel and serial chains.
- Efficiency demonstrated on 1-DOF parallel mechanism and 4-DOF manipulator with accuracy of 0.02% against physics simulator.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient analytical approach for forward dynamics of complex parallel-serial robots needed for advanced control methods. Key novelty is projecting parallel mechanism dynamics to lower dimension and applying articulated body method to derive recursive O(n) algorithm.
