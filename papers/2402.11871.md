# [From Reals to Logic and Back: Inventing Symbolic Vocabularies, Actions,   and Models for Planning from Raw Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Creating symbolic, logic-based representations (e.g. PDDL models) for robot planning requires strong human intuition and expertise. Removing this dependency on human expertise is an active area of research. The paper aims to address this problem by developing an approach to autonomously learn symbolic representations from raw robot trajectories, without needing any human annotations.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents the first approach, called LAMP (Learning Abstract Models for Planning), that can simultaneously learn:
1) A relational predicate vocabulary 
2) High-level symbolic actions
3) Action models
from unlabeled, real-valued robot trajectories. 

Key ideas:
- Introduce the concept of "relational critical regions" to identify salient relationships between objects from relative poses in trajectories. This allows inventing meaningful predicate vocabulary.

- Discover symbolic actions as transitions to and from the relational critical regions. Learn action models using associative learning from state transitions in trajectories.

- Use the learned symbolic representations to plan for new, more complex tasks. Continually expand representations by identifying missing predicates and actions when planning fails.

Main Contributions:
- First approach to simultaneously learn relational predicate vocabularies and high-level symbolic actions from raw robot trajectories, without any human supervision.

- Introduce "relational critical regions" to identify salient object relationships and invent interpretable predicate vocabulary.

- Associative learning of action models from state transitions in unlabeled trajectories.

- Continual planning, execution and learning of new predicates and actions for solving more complex tasks.

- Extensive evaluation showing the learned representations enable scaling to more complex tasks with longer horizons and 3x more objects compared to training tasks.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach for robot learning that removes the dependency on human expertise for creating symbolic representations. The approach invents interpretable predicate vocabularies and action models from scratch, using unlabeled robot trajectories. It also enables continual expansion of representations for solving more complex tasks over time.
