# [Decoding Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01528)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speculative decoding is a technique to speed up inference for large language models (LLMs) by using a smaller "draft" model to generate speculative tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM. 
- Prior work assumed choosing draft models with higher token acceptance rate (TAR) yields better throughput, but experiments in this paper show the contrary - smaller models with lower TAR provide higher throughput.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper analyzes the factors affecting speculative decoding throughput - TAR, draft model latency, target model latency. 
- An analytical model is proposed to capture the interactions between these factors and predict throughput. This highlights the need to balance TAR gains with draft model latency.
- The analytical model is used to quantify model/hardware improvements needed to switch draft models. It can also predict draft model designs to boost throughput.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive study of serving open-source 65B parameter LLMs with speculative decoding.
- Analytical model relating TAR, model latencies and throughput to guide draft model selection and design.
- Analysis revealing smaller draft models can provide higher throughput than larger ones despite lower TAR.
- A new 1.3B parameter draft model for serving 65B LLaMA providing 30% higher throughput over prior draft models.

Overall, the paper provides useful insights and tools to optimize speculative decoding throughput, highlighting the need to balance TAR and model latency when choosing draft models. The proposed analytical model can guide users to pick or design better draft models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the factors affecting the throughput of speculative decoding for serving large language models, proposes an analytical model to guide draft model selection, and shows how to design a draft model tailored for higher throughput.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors conduct a large-scale experimental study with over 340 experiments to understand how to optimize the throughput of speculative decoding, outlining the various factors which affect throughput.

2. They propose an analytical model to characterize the performance of speculative decoding and analyze how improvements in model and hardware would affect the choice of the draft model. 

3. Using their analytical model, they show how to best design draft model architecture and describe a modified draft model that outperforms existing draft models by 30% with just a fraction of the training costs.

So in summary, the key contributions are a detailed experimental analysis, an analytical performance model, and using these insights to design better draft models for speculative decoding to improve throughput.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work on optimizing speculative decoding for large language models include:

- Speculative decoding - Using a smaller "draft" model to generate speculative tokens, which are then verified by the target large language model to improve throughput.

- Token acceptance rate (TAR) - The average number of tokens generated by the draft model that are accepted by the target model. Prior work assumed higher TAR leads to higher throughput.   

- Analytical model - The paper proposes an analytical model to predict speculative decoding throughput based on factors like TAR, draft model latency, and target model latency.

- Draft model selection - The paper analyzes how to choose the optimal draft model by considering the tradeoffs between TAR gains and increased latency of larger models.

- Draft model design - The paper shows the potential to specially design draft models focused on maximizing speculative decoding throughput, rather than just task accuracy.

- Throughput - The key goal is improving tokens generated per second when serving large language models using speculative decoding.

So in summary, the key terms cover speculative decoding, draft models, token acceptance rate, analytical modeling, draft model selection and design, and throughput.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an analytical model to predict the throughput of speculative decoding. How does this model account for the interaction between factors like draft model latency, target model latency, and token acceptance rate? Does it make simplifying assumptions that could limit its accuracy?

2. The paper argues that token acceptance rate alone is not sufficient for choosing an optimal draft model. What other factors need to be considered and how does the analytical model incorporate those?

3. When evaluating draft models, the paper analyzes required improvements in token acceptance rate and latency to match the throughput of the smallest draft model. What implications does this analysis have for draft model design?

4. The paper introduces a "wider and shallower" draft model architecture that improves throughput despite lower token acceptance rate. What modifications were made to model width and depth? How does this impact latency and hardware utilization?  

5. The analytical model is verified against real hardware measurements. What was the maximum deviation observed between the model predictions and measured throughput? What could account for this deviation?

6. How does the choice of speculative token generation length impact observed token acceptance rate versus actual token acceptance capacity? What effect does this have on overall throughput?

7. The paper argues that task accuracy is not strongly correlated with token acceptance rate. Why might this be the case? What implications does this have for designing draft models optimized for speculative decoding?

8. The analytical model focuses on draft and target models run in sequence. How could the model be extended to account for parallelized draft models or early exit techniques?

9. What differences might be observed in optimal draft model selection and design when evaluated on different hardware platforms (e.g. V100, A100, H100)? 

10. The designed "NoFT" draft model uses only a fraction of the training data of prior work. How does this approach trade off accuracy and training costs? Could accuracy be improved with more data while retaining throughput gains?
