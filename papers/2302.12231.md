# [DiffusioNeRF: Regularizing Neural Radiance Fields with Denoising   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: how can we regularize neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to improve their performance when training data is limited? 

Specifically, the paper proposes using a denoising diffusion model (DDM) as a learned prior over the color and geometry (i.e. density field) of a scene to regularize NeRF training. The key hypotheses are:

1) A DDM trained on RGBD patches can learn a strong prior over plausible color and geometry. 

2) The gradients from this DDM can serve as a regularization term during NeRF optimization by providing the direction towards more likely color and geometry configurations.

3) This regularization can compensate for the lack of constraints when NeRFs are trained with limited views, leading to improved novel view synthesis and geometry reconstruction compared to unregularized NeRFs or those regularized with other hand-designed losses.

In essence, the paper proposes using a data-driven learned prior over scene color and geometry in place of hand-engineered regularizers. The experiments aim to validate that this DDM-based regularization improves NeRF performance in the low-data regime across different datasets.
