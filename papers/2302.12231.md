# [DiffusioNeRF: Regularizing Neural Radiance Fields with Denoising   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: how can we regularize neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to improve their performance when training data is limited? 

Specifically, the paper proposes using a denoising diffusion model (DDM) as a learned prior over the color and geometry (i.e. density field) of a scene to regularize NeRF training. The key hypotheses are:

1) A DDM trained on RGBD patches can learn a strong prior over plausible color and geometry. 

2) The gradients from this DDM can serve as a regularization term during NeRF optimization by providing the direction towards more likely color and geometry configurations.

3) This regularization can compensate for the lack of constraints when NeRFs are trained with limited views, leading to improved novel view synthesis and geometry reconstruction compared to unregularized NeRFs or those regularized with other hand-designed losses.

In essence, the paper proposes using a data-driven learned prior over scene color and geometry in place of hand-engineered regularizers. The experiments aim to validate that this DDM-based regularization improves NeRF performance in the low-data regime across different datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to regularize neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Specifically:

- They train a DDM on RGBD patches from the Hypersim dataset to learn a prior over color and geometry. 

- The DDM provides the gradient of the log-likelihood of RGBD patches, which serves as a regularizer when optimizing NeRFs with gradient descent. Taking steps in the negative DDM gradient direction brings NeRF renderings closer to the natural image distribution learned by the DDM.

- They show that incorporating the DDM as a regularizer improves NeRF optimization, leading to higher quality novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, especially when trained with few input views.

- Evaluations on the LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate improved generalization of NeRFs to novel views and higher quality geometry when the DDM regularizer is used.

In summary, the key contribution is using denoising diffusion models to learn an RGBD patch prior that acts as a regularizer to improve NeRF optimization and generalization. The DDM allows jointly modeling color and geometry instead of using separate regularization terms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using a denoising diffusion model trained on RGBD patches from a synthetic indoor scene dataset as a learned prior to regularize the color and density fields of neural radiance fields, which improves reconstruction quality when training with few views.
