# [DiffusioNeRF: Regularizing Neural Radiance Fields with Denoising   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12231)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: how can we regularize neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to improve their performance when training data is limited? 

Specifically, the paper proposes using a denoising diffusion model (DDM) as a learned prior over the color and geometry (i.e. density field) of a scene to regularize NeRF training. The key hypotheses are:

1) A DDM trained on RGBD patches can learn a strong prior over plausible color and geometry. 

2) The gradients from this DDM can serve as a regularization term during NeRF optimization by providing the direction towards more likely color and geometry configurations.

3) This regularization can compensate for the lack of constraints when NeRFs are trained with limited views, leading to improved novel view synthesis and geometry reconstruction compared to unregularized NeRFs or those regularized with other hand-designed losses.

In essence, the paper proposes using a data-driven learned prior over scene color and geometry in place of hand-engineered regularizers. The experiments aim to validate that this DDM-based regularization improves NeRF performance in the low-data regime across different datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to regularize neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Specifically:

- They train a DDM on RGBD patches from the Hypersim dataset to learn a prior over color and geometry. 

- The DDM provides the gradient of the log-likelihood of RGBD patches, which serves as a regularizer when optimizing NeRFs with gradient descent. Taking steps in the negative DDM gradient direction brings NeRF renderings closer to the natural image distribution learned by the DDM.

- They show that incorporating the DDM as a regularizer improves NeRF optimization, leading to higher quality novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, especially when trained with few input views.

- Evaluations on the LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate improved generalization of NeRFs to novel views and higher quality geometry when the DDM regularizer is used.

In summary, the key contribution is using denoising diffusion models to learn an RGBD patch prior that acts as a regularizer to improve NeRF optimization and generalization. The DDM allows jointly modeling color and geometry instead of using separate regularization terms.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using a denoising diffusion model trained on RGBD patches from a synthetic indoor scene dataset as a learned prior to regularize the color and density fields of neural radiance fields, which improves reconstruction quality when training with few views.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in novel view synthesis with neural radiance fields:

- The paper focuses on regularizing NeRFs to improve results when training with limited views. Many other papers have proposed NeRF regularization techniques, but this paper uses a denoising diffusion model (DDM) trained on RGBD patches as a learned prior over geometry and appearance. Using a DDM to provide gradients of the log-data distribution is a novel regularization approach.

- Compared to hand-designed regularizers like smoothness terms, the DDM acts as a more flexible learned prior that can capture complex relationships in geometry and appearance. The DDM is trained on synthetic indoor scenes and transferred to real datasets.

- Most prior work regularizes geometry and color separately. By training the DDM on RGBD patches, this method models correlations between color and depth.

- The paper compares against recent methods like RegNeRF and MVSNeRF which also use some form of regularization or priors for few-view NeRFs. The results show the proposed DDM regularization performs competitively, especially on geometry metrics.

- The approach builds on Instant-NGP for fast NeRF optimization. Many recent papers have focused on speeding up NeRF training and rendering, so building on fast methods is important.

- The core idea of using diffusion models as regularizers could potentially be applied to other tasks optimized with gradients, like depth estimation or stereo matching.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel learned regularization approach for NeRF using DDMs that captures relationships between geometry and appearance. The results demonstrate improved quality compared to baseline NeRF methods when trained with limited views. The idea of using diffusion models as regularizers is a promising research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Formulating a principled approach to combine the DDM gradient with the NeRF objective loss, instead of using heuristics for scheduling parameters like Ï„ and loss term weights. This would allow automatically balancing the reconstruction accuracy vs overall smoothness.

- Applying the general idea of using DDMs as regularizers for other tasks optimized via gradient descent, such as monocular depth estimation or stereo matching. The DDM could provide useful priors to constrain the solution space.

- Using the DDM framework to regularize the 3D voxel grid of densities directly, instead of RGBD patches. This could be done by training the DDM on voxel blocks of density values, and incorporating its gradients during NeRF optimization to constrain the density field. Early results along this direction are mentioned.

- Further work on finding optimal network architectures and training procedures for DDMs to capture complex multimodal distributions over scene properties like color and geometry.

- Evaluating the benefits of the proposed approach on larger and more diverse datasets.

In summary, the main future directions are around generalizing the framework to other tasks, directly regularizing geometric properties like density, improving the modeling capacity of DDMs, and more comprehensive evaluation. The core idea of using DDM gradients as a learned regularizer is promising and could be explored further.
