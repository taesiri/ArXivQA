# [Automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding for Markov processes and   graphical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03509)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper develops a framework called automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) for efficient inference on latent states and model parameters in probabilistic graphical models that contain Markov processes as building blocks. The key ideas are:

- Start with a generative probabilistic model defined by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) containing both latent and observed variables. The transitions between variables are described by Markov kernels. 

- Transform the generative model into a "guided" model that approximates the conditional distribution given observations, by using backward filtering and forward guiding operations.

- The backward filtering step propagates information from the observed variables towards the latent variables to construct an approximate conditional distribution. 

- The forward guiding step then transforms the generative model into a guided model using this backward filtered information, in a way that preserves the original graphical structure.

- This guided model can then be used for efficient inference on the latent states and parameters, using sampling or optimization based techniques.

- The framework is general, applying to both discrete and continuous time Markov processes on trees or DAGs. It is also compositional, allowing inference modules to be built up from simpler components.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that automatic BFFG provides an efficient and flexible way to perform inference in probabilistic graphical models containing latent Markov processes, while preserving the original graphical structure. The paper aims to demonstrate the applicability of this approach across a range of models and inference techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research on directed graphical models and Bayesian inference:

- The key novelty in this paper is the proposed automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) approach for performing inference on latent variables and model parameters in directed graphical models. This extends the authors' prior work on guided proposals for diffusion processes to a much broader class of probabilistic models.

- The BFFG approach is agnostic to the choice of inferential method (e.g. MCMC, SMC, VI) and aims to leverage the directed acyclic graph structure to efficiently construct guided approximations. This is in contrast to classic methods like belief propagation that operate directly on the conditional distributions.

- Related methods like backward simulation for state space models and EP-type approximations also construct approximations guided by the observations. However, BFFG is more automatic and generic by using program transformation rules that can be applied to any composition of kernels.

- The compositionality results connecting BFFG to category theory concepts like optics are novel. This provides a unifying abstract perspective on constructing guided processes through forward/backward message passing.

- The examples cover a broad range of models like discrete/continuous time Markov processes, branching processes, and stochastic differential equations. This demonstrates the wide applicability of BFFG compared to more model-specific inference methods.

- Overall, the BFFG framework seems quite innovative in its aim to provide a generic, automatic approach to guided inference that can be incorporated into probabilistic programming systems. The connections to optics and program transformations are interesting conceptually.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing new methods for high-dimensional inference and computation. The authors suggest exploring approaches like sparse Gaussian processes, divide-and-conquer strategies, and distributed computing methods to handle very large datasets and models.

- Extending Bayesian inference methods to deal with non-independent data such as time series or networks. The authors mention possibilities like using conditional independence, graphical models, and latent variable representations.

- Improving scalability of Bayesian computation methods. The authors suggest using variational methods, expectation propagation, integrated nested Laplace approximations, and sequential Monte Carlo for larger datasets. Parallel and distributed computing is also mentioned.

- Developing better model choice and averaging methods. The authors suggest more research on reversible jump MCMC, product space methods, and stacking/ensembling for Bayesian model averaging.

- Advancing theory and methods for nonparametric Bayes models like Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes.

- Expanding Bayesian methodology to new types of models like infinite factorial dynamical models.

- Developing new MCMC diagnostics and convergence methods, especially for complex and high-dimensional models.

- Expanding theory and methods for Bayesian experimental design.

So in summary, the authors point towards scaling up Bayesian methods, extending them to new types of data and models, improving computational techniques, and developing better model comparison/averaging approaches as key areas for future research. Advancing both theory and methods for Bayesian statistics is emphasized.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) approach for efficient inference on latent states and model parameters in probabilistic graphical models containing Markov processes. It starts from a generative model description and uses approximate backward information filtering to transform it into a guided model that approximates the true conditional model. This guided model preserves the original dependence structure and can be incorporated into sampling-based inference methods like MCMC and variational inference. The backward filter and forward guiding operations have a compositional structure, allowing them to be formulated as transformation rules suitable for automated probabilistic programming. Examples show the approach applied to various Markov process models, including interacting particle systems, stochastic differential equations, and Gamma processes. Overall, the BFFG method provides a general, automatic way to leverage conditional independence structure and employ approximate backward filtering for efficient inference in complex probabilistic models containing Markov processes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces the automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) paradigm for inference on latent states and model parameters in probabilistic graphical models with Markovian dynamics. The key idea is to transform a generative model into a guided model that incorporates information from data. This is done via two passes: a backward filtering pass that propagates information from the observed leaves towards the root, followed by a forward pass that changes the dynamics based on the filtering. 

The backward filtering step involves approximating the intractable Doob h-transform using tractable backward kernels. The forward pass uses these to guide transitions via an exponential change of measure. This results in a guided model that preserves the Markovian structure and dependence graph. Theoretical results are provided, showing how the guided model approximates the true conditional model. Examples are given for various Markov processes, including discrete-time chains, diffusions, and countable state space chains. The method is presented as suitable for automated probabilistic programming.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) paradigm for programmable inference on latent states and model parameters in probabilistic models consisting of Markov processes and graphical models. The key idea is to incorporate discrete and continuous time Markov processes as building blocks into probabilistic graphical models and then transform the generative model into a guided approximation that incorporates information from observations. This is done by first filtering information backwards from the observations towards the root using tractable backward kernels and then changing the measure in the generative model forwards guided by this information. The backward filter and forward change of measure can be formulated as transformation rules suitable for automatic implementation. The guided approximation preserves the Markovian structure of the original model and serves as a pre-conditional model that can be incorporated into different inference methods like MCMC or variational inference to efficiently sample the actual conditional distribution. A variety of examples involving Markov chains, particle systems, stochastic differential equations etc. are provided.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 I do not have enough context to summarize the main contribution of this paper based solely on the LaTeX code provided. A paper's contribution is typically summarized in the abstract and introduction. If those sections were provided, I could attempt to identify the key ideas being presented. However, from just the LaTeX preamble and document structure, I cannot infer the core intellectual content or novelty. Some general things I can say based on the code:

- It seems to be a paper about probabilistic graphical models, Markov processes, and inference algorithms. The keywords and MSC classifications point to topics like directed acyclic graphs, Markov processes, Bayesian networks, filtering, etc.

- There is a focus on compositionality and automated transformation of probabilistic programs. The introduction mentions incorporating Markov processes into graphical models in a "programmable" and "automated" way.

- Concepts like guided processes, backward filtering, and forward guiding are discussed, suggesting the paper introduces techniques for inference on graphical models with latent variables.

- There are various theorems and proofs, so new mathematical results are likely derived.

- The appendix has a literature review section, so the paper probably relates its contributions to a body of existing work.

But without seeing the actual technical content, I can't summarize the core intellectual contribution or scientific novelty. The preamble gives hints about the general topic, but does not convey the specific innovations or results described in the full paper text.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main points of this paper are:

- It incorporates discrete and continuous time Markov processes as building blocks into probabilistic graphical models with latent and observed variables.  

- It introduces the automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) paradigm for programmable inference on latent states and model parameters.

- Starting from a generative model (a forward description of the probabilistic process dynamics), it backpropagates the information provided by observations to transform the generative model into a pre-conditional model guided by the data. This approximates the actual conditional model and provides a likelihood ratio between the two.

- The backward filter and forward change of measure can be formulated as transformation rules suitable for probabilistic programming.

- The guided generative model can be incorporated into different approaches to efficiently sample latent states and parameters conditional on observations, including Markov chains, interacting particle systems, state space models, branching diffusions and Gamma processes.

- It provides a principle of compositionality, so that transforming a probabilistic program relies on composing the transformations of its elementary building blocks in a backward and forward pass.

In summary, the paper develops a general framework for efficient Bayesian inference in graphical models containing Markov processes, by approximating the intractable backward information filter and using this to guide the generative model. The modular, automatic and compositional nature of the approach makes it suitable for probabilistic programming.
