# [Learning Bottleneck Concepts in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10131)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to learn interpretable bottleneck concepts for image classification in an end-to-end manner without explicit supervision on the concepts themselves. The key points are:- The paper proposes Bottleneck Concept Learner (BotCL), which simultaneously discovers concepts and learns the classifier for a given image classification task. - The concepts are learned through self-supervision and regularizers to make them more consistent and distinctive without the need for concept annotations.- An image is solely represented by the presence/absence of the learned concepts (concept bottleneck). This allows optimizing concepts for the target task.- The method provides intrinsic explainability by showing which concepts are present in the image and their importance for classification.So in summary, the main goal is to learn interpretable bottleneck concepts optimized for a target image classification task in a completely unsupervised manner. BotCL aims to provide explainability through these learned concepts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Bottleneck Concept Learner (BotCL) for simultaneously discovering human-interpretable concepts and learning an image classifier using those concepts. Here are the key points:- BotCL represents images solely by the presence/absence of a set of concepts, creating a "concept bottleneck". This forces the model to use the concepts to make predictions. - The concepts are learned in a self-supervised manner during training on an image classification task, without needing explicit labels for the concepts. This allows optimizing the concepts for the task.- Two main techniques are used for concept learning: 1) contrastive self-supervision loss and 2) regularizers that encourage individual consistency of concepts and mutual distinctiveness between concepts.- Experiments on MNIST, CUB200, ImageNet and a synthetic dataset show BotCL can learn interpretable concepts without significantly hurting classification accuracy.- Qualitative and quantitative evaluation as well as a user study demonstrate the discovered concepts are human-understandable, consistent and distinct.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting an end-to-end framework to simultaneously learn visual concepts and an image classifier in a self-supervised manner, resulting in more interpretable models that maintain accuracy. The concept bottleneck structure and tailored concept regularizers are key to this.
