# [Mask is All You Need: Rethinking Mask R-CNN for Dense and   Arbitrary-Shaped Scene Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03426)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the performance of Mask R-CNN for dense and arbitrary-shaped scene text detection?In particular, the authors identify two key issues with using Mask R-CNN for dense scene text detection:1. The "learning confusion" issue that arises when multiple text instances fall into a single region proposal, making it difficult for the mask head to distinguish between them. 2. The difficulty in manually designing good anchors to match text instances with large variance in scale and aspect ratio.To address these issues, the main hypotheses/proposals in the paper are:1. Using an MLP decoder instead of the standard "deconv-conv" decoder in the mask head can alleviate the learning confusion issue.2. Instance-aware mask learning, where the mask predicts the overall shape rather than classifying each pixel, can better distinguish text instances. 3. An adaptive label assignment method for the region proposal network can enable simpler anchor settings while still covering variance in aspect ratios.The experiments then aim to validate whether these proposed techniques can improve detection performance on dense and arbitrary-shaped scene text, especially on challenging benchmarks designed for those cases.In summary, the central research question is how to adapt Mask R-CNN to better handle dense and arbitrarily-shaped text, and the main hypotheses are around modifications to the mask head and anchor assignment. The experiments aim to validate if those changes improve detection performance.
