# [Event-based Temporally Dense Optical Flow Estimation with Sequential   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01244)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: 

How can neural networks be trained to produce temporally dense optical flow estimations from event camera data streams?

The key points are:

- Event cameras produce data at a high temporal rate in an asynchronous manner. Past approaches collect events over a period of time and make optical flow predictions at a lower frequency. 

- The authors propose casting optical flow estimation as a sequential learning problem to achieve temporally dense predictions that better utilize the high rate of event data.

- They train LSTM and spiking neural networks (SNNs) using modifications to standard sequential training approaches to enable continuous prediction on event streams without network reset.

- Experiments show they can achieve 10x more temporally dense optical flow prediction over past approaches using LSTM and SNNs. The LSTM also shows 19.7% better accuracy over a baseline due to retaining longer temporal correlations.

- The SNN is shown to achieve similar dense optical flow predictions as LSTM but with 31.8% fewer parameters, demonstrating its efficiency for this task.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that sequential neural networks can be trained to exploit the high rate event data for temporally dense and accurate optical flow estimation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Casting optical flow estimation as a sequential learning problem to achieve temporally dense optical flow prediction. The trained sequential neural networks (LSTMs and SNNs) produce 10x more temporally dense flow estimation compared to existing approaches. 

2. Showing that typical sequential training approaches do not translate well for continuous flow estimation from an event stream. The proposed modifications to the training methodology lead to a 19.7% improvement in prediction accuracy of the LSTM network compared to a similar model without internal states. This is attributed to the network's ability to draw longer temporal correlations from the event stream.

3. Proposing an SNN architecture that is more efficient than LSTM networks in handling asynchronous event streams. The SNN predicts temporally dense optical flow with acceptable quality using 31.8% fewer parameters and at least 31.1% fewer multiplication operations compared to the LSTM network. This demonstrates the potential for energy-efficient implementations.

In summary, the main contribution is using sequential neural networks to achieve temporally dense optical flow estimation from event streams, while proposing modifications to the training methodology and analyzing the efficiency benefits of using SNNs. The end goal is fast and continuous optical flow prediction suitable for time-critical applications.
