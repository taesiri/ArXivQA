# [Event-based Temporally Dense Optical Flow Estimation with Sequential   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01244)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: How can neural networks be trained to produce temporally dense optical flow estimations from event camera data streams?The key points are:- Event cameras produce data at a high temporal rate in an asynchronous manner. Past approaches collect events over a period of time and make optical flow predictions at a lower frequency. - The authors propose casting optical flow estimation as a sequential learning problem to achieve temporally dense predictions that better utilize the high rate of event data.- They train LSTM and spiking neural networks (SNNs) using modifications to standard sequential training approaches to enable continuous prediction on event streams without network reset.- Experiments show they can achieve 10x more temporally dense optical flow prediction over past approaches using LSTM and SNNs. The LSTM also shows 19.7% better accuracy over a baseline due to retaining longer temporal correlations.- The SNN is shown to achieve similar dense optical flow predictions as LSTM but with 31.8% fewer parameters, demonstrating its efficiency for this task.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that sequential neural networks can be trained to exploit the high rate event data for temporally dense and accurate optical flow estimation.
