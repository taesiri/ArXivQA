# [Unmasked Teacher: Towards Training-Efficient Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16058)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that an image foundation model like CLIP can be used as an "unmasked teacher" to train a video transformer from scratch in a data-efficient and computationally-efficient manner. 

The key ideas are:

- Using CLIP as a teacher provides semantic guidance to help the video model learn effective spatiotemporal representations from limited data.

- Masking out most video tokens reduces computational costs. Selectively aligning unmasked tokens with CLIP provides supervision while avoiding pixel-level reconstruction.

- A two-stage progressive pre-training framework enables handling both video-only tasks and video-language tasks.

- Compared to prior video models relying on image foundation models or reconstruction, this approach is more data-efficient, time-efficient, and results in better performance on various benchmarks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that utilizing CLIP as an unmasked teacher can overcome limitations of prior work and enable better video foundation models with less data and computation. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of this proposed learning paradigm.
