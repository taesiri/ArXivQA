# [FAGH: Accelerating Federated Learning with Approximated Global Hessian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) aims to train a global machine learning model over decentralized data located on multiple client devices without exchanging the raw private data. 
- However, FL suffers from slow convergence and requires a large number of communication rounds between the central server and clients to reach a good global model performance. This leads to high communication costs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new federated optimization algorithm called FAGH (Federated learning with Approximated Global Hessian) to accelerate the convergence of the global model in FL. 

- FAGH utilizes second-order curvature information from the Hessian matrix to determine the Newton update direction, which converges faster than just using first-order gradient information. 

- However, computing the full Hessian is computationally expensive. So FAGH approximates the global Hessian at the server by aggregating only the first row of the local Hessian from each client.

- The server then directly computes an approximated Newton update direction using the Sherman-Morrison formula, without needing to store and invert the full Hessian matrix.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a computationally efficient approximation to utilize second-order Hessian information to accelerate federated learning, without high computational and memory costs.

- Eliminates the need for separate communications of gradients and updated models in each round like prior Newton-based methods. FAGH has only two communications per round.

- Experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate FAGH requires much fewer rounds of communication between server and clients to reach a target model performance compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.

- FAGH also converges faster in terms of wall-clock time while maintaining similar or better end performance.

- The method is easy to implement with low computational overhead for clients and modest memory needs for the server.

In summary, FAGH makes federated learning more communication-efficient by using an approximated second-order Hessian to achieve faster convergence to an accurate global model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FAGH, a federated learning algorithm that accelerates global model training by approximating the global Hessian using only the first row of the local Hessians to determine the Newton update direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of FAGH, the proposed federated learning algorithm, are:

1. Each client finds the gradient and first row of the Hessian of the local loss function and sends these to the server. The server aggregates these to find the first moments of the global gradient and global Hessian's first row.

2. FAGH directly computes the global Newton direction using these first moments of the global gradient and first row of the global Hessian, without needing to store and calculate the full global Hessian matrix. 

3. Using this directly computed global Newton direction leads to faster training convergence in federated learning, with linear time and space complexities.

So in summary, the main contribution is a communication-efficient way to approximate the global Newton direction using only the first row of the Hessian, which accelerates federated learning convergence compared to existing methods.

The paper proposes a new federated learning algorithm called FAGH that uses an approximated global Hessian to accelerate the convergence of the global model training. Key aspects include approximating the Hessian using just the first row, computing the global Newton direction directly using the Sherman-Morrison formula to avoid forming the full Hessian, and analyzing the time and space complexities. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate faster convergence and reduced communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that FAGH eliminates the need for four separate communications per round like in DONE or GIANT. How exactly does FAGH reduce the communication overhead compared to these methods? 

2. The proof provided for Statement 1 relies on the chain rule and assumes F is a nonlinear twice differentiable function. What changes would be needed in the formulation if F was not twice differentiable or nonlinear?

3. The paper utilizes the Sherman-Morrison formula to directly compute the Newton update direction. What are the computational advantages of using this formula rather than explicitly calculating and inverting the Hessian matrix?

4. Hyperparameters beta1 and beta2 are set similar to Adam. What is the intuition behind using exponential decay rates for the gradient and Hessian moving averages in FAGH? How does this help in case of partial client participation per round?

5. The space complexity on the server is said to be only 3 times more than FedAvg. Provide a detailed mathematical analysis quantifying the additional memory requirements on the server as compared to FedAvg.

6. The applicability of FAGH is limited to twice differentiable, nonlinear objectives. What changes can be incorporated in FAGH to make it applicable for non-smooth objectives like hinge loss or L1 regularization that arise in SVM and sparse learning?

7. The compression techniques used in FedNL and Basis Matters are suggested to handle the 2d communication cost in FAGH. Provide specifics on what compression schemes can be used and how much reduction in communication cost can be achieved.

8. The experiments show better performance of FAGH over DONE and GIANT only for the MLR case. What are the possible reasons it failed in the CNN case? How can FAGH be improved to work for CNNs as well?

9. The local computations in FAGH involve gradient and a single Hessian row. Provide a run time analysis comparing the local computation time per round for FAGH against first order methods like FedAvg and other second order methods.

10. The global model update in FAGH uses exponential moving averages of gradients and Hessian rows. What are the convergence guarantees for this approximate Newton method? How does it compare against true Newton method or Quasi-Newton approaches?
