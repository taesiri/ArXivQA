# [STEVE-1: A Generative Model for Text-to-Behavior in Minecraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00937)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses seem to be:

1. Can the unCLIP approach used in DALL-E 2 for text-to-image generation also work effectively for creating an instruction-following agent for sequential decision making tasks in Minecraft?

2. Can finetuning the pretrained VPT model with a small amount of compute and data allow it to follow short-horizon text instructions in Minecraft? 

3. Does using pretrained models like VPT and MineCLIP, along with techniques like hindsight relabeling and classifier-free guidance, allow an agent to achieve strong instruction following performance in Minecraft using only raw pixels and low-level actions?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by decomposing the problem into a VPT policy finetuned on hindsight relabeled visual goals and a prior that predicts those goals from text, an effective instruction-following agent can be created with modest compute and data requirements. The experiments aim to demonstrate this approach and that the resulting agent, Steve-1, sets a new benchmark for open-ended instruction following in Minecraft.

In summary, the main research focus is on adapting the unCLIP framework to create an affordable yet capable instruction-following agent for sequential decision making in Minecraft by finetuning the pretrained VPT model. The key hypothesis is that this approach can work much better than training an agent from scratch.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces \agentname{}, a Minecraft agent that can follow open-ended text and visual instructions with a high degree of accuracy on short-horizon tasks. The paper shows through extensive evaluations that \agentname{} can perform a wide variety of tasks in Minecraft when prompted appropriately.

2. It proposes a method to create \agentname{} that finetunes the pretrained VPT model using the unCLIP approach and classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image domain. This allows finetuning VPT through self-supervised behavioral cloning and hindsight relabeling without needing costly human text annotations. The paper shows this approach works well using only \$60 of compute and around 2,000 trajectory segments with goals.

3. The paper releases the model weights for \agentname{}, as well as training scripts and evaluation code, with the aim of fostering more research into building instructable, open-ended agents for sequential decision-making. 

4. The paper provides experimental analysis highlighting factors important for good performance of the method, including pretraining, classifier-free guidance, and data scaling.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a method to create an instructable Minecraft agent using ideas from the text-to-image domain, requiring little compute and human labeling. The paper shows this approach works well and releases resources to facilitate further research into building instructable decision-making agents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to create an agent called Steve-1 that can follow open-ended text and visual instructions in Minecraft by finetuning the pretrained VPT model using an unCLIP-based approach with classifier-free guidance and a CVAE prior, demonstrating strong performance on short-horizon tasks with only $60 of compute.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper builds on prior work in instruction-following agents, especially the recent VPT and MineCLIP models. However, it takes a novel approach by adapting the unCLIP method from image generation to create an agent that can follow open-ended instructions. 

- Most prior work has focused on training instruction-following policies using reinforcement learning or supervised learning directly on human-labeled instructional data. This paper instead shows that good performance can be achieved by leveraging self-supervised training with hindsight relabeling and pretrained foundation models like VPT and MineCLIP.

- The performance and capability demonstrated by the agent, Steve-1, seems to exceed prior instruction-following agents for Minecraft. It can accomplish a wider range of short-horizon tasks with higher accuracy compared to prior baselines.

- The compute and data requirements are far lower than for training most instruction-following agents. With only $60 of compute and around 2,000 human-labeled examples, the pretrained models could be adapted to follow instructions. This is orders of magnitude less data than usually needed.

- The method of combining a visual goal-conditioned policy and text-to-goal-embedding prior based on unCLIP seems novel in adapting this approach from text/image domains to sequential decision making.

- The analyses on factors like scaling, pretraining, and classifier-free guidance provide useful insights about training instruction-following agents that have been lacking in prior work.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in open-ended instruction following agents by creatively adapting recent advances in foundation models and generative modeling. The low resource requirements and extensive performance evaluations also help advance the field meaningfully.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on reading the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Improving the performance of the agent on longer-horizon tasks. The authors note that their agent \agentname{} mainly excels at short-horizon tasks right now, so further work could aim to enhance its capabilities for more complex, multi-step tasks like crafting and building. Ideas include using more advanced prompt chaining techniques or incorporating language models.

- Better understanding the scaling properties of instruction-tuned agents like \agentname{}. The authors did some initial investigations into how performance on different tasks scales with more data and compute during pretraining and finetuning, but suggest more analysis is needed to fully characterize and predict the scaling behavior.

- Applying this unCLIP-based approach to create instruction-following agents in other domains beyond Minecraft, such as robotics, other video games, and web environments. The generality of the method makes it promising to explore in new sequential decision making problems that involve vision-based observations and low-level action spaces.

- Mitigating potential negative societal impacts of releasing generative models of behavior that can follow open-ended instructions. The authors acknowledge concerns around bias and misuse, and suggest that further safety research will be important as capabilities continue to improve.

- Improving the prior model to convert text instructions to latent goals, perhaps using more advanced text-to-image models as a source of supervision. Better text-to-goal modeling could improve the flexibility and accuracy of instruction following.

- Combining \agentname{} with large language models to enable higher-level planning and language interaction. The authors suggest complementing the low-level control policy of \agentname{} with linguistic planning capabilities.

In summary, the main future directions center around scaling up capabilities, applying the approach to new domains, improving safety and societal considerations, and combining \agentname{} with other AI techniques like language models. The authors lay the foundation for instruction-following agents using unCLIP, while suggesting many promising avenues for advancing this line of research.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Steve-1, a Minecraft agent that can follow open-ended text and visual instructions. The authors take inspiration from the unCLIP approach used in DALL-E 2 to decompose the problem into a policy model finetuned from VPT to follow goals in the MineCLIP latent space, and a prior model to translate text to those latent codes.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an instruction-tuned Video Pretraining (VPT) model called \agentname{} for Minecraft\texttrademark, demonstrating that the unCLIP approach used in DALLâ€¢E 2 can be effective for creating instruction-following agents for sequential decision-making tasks. The key idea is to decompose the problem into two models: a VPT policy finetuned to achieve visual goals embedded in MineCLIP's latent space, and a prior model to translate text instructions to MineCLIP embeddings. By leveraging VPT and MineCLIP as foundation models and utilizing behavioral cloning with self-supervised hindsight relabeling, the authors are able to finetune VPT to follow short-horizon text instructions with only $60 of compute and around 2,000 instruction-labeled trajectory segments. 

The authors perform extensive evaluations showing that \agentname{} can accurately follow a wide variety of short-horizon text and visual instructions in Minecraft. They also show that prompt chaining dramatically improves performance on longer-horizon tasks like crafting and building. The authors analyze the factors contributing to \agentname{}'s strong performance, including pretraining, classifier-free guidance, and data scaling. They release all resources to foster more research into open-ended instruction following for sequential decision making. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of instruction-tuning foundation models of behavior and sets a new benchmark for low-level instruction following in Minecraft.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a two-step approach for creating an instruction-following agent in Minecraft called \agentname{}. First, the pretrained VPT model is finetuned to follow visual goals embedded in the MineCLIP latent space. This is done via behavioral cloning and hindsight relabeling on a dataset of Minecraft gameplay to generate goal-conditioned data without needing expensive human text annotations. Second, a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) prior model is trained to translate text instructions into MineCLIP visual embeddings. The prior and finetuned policy models are then combined at inference time to allow the agent to follow text instructions: the CVAE prior converts the text prompt to a visual embedding which conditions the policy to generate goal-directed behavior. The policy's conditioning is improved through the use of classifier-free guidance, trading off between unconditioned and goal-conditioned actions. This approach allows \agentname{} to follow a wide variety of textual and visual instructions in Minecraft with a high degree of accuracy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper is studying whether the recent approach of instruction-tuning foundation models, which has shown promise in text and image domains, could also work for sequential decision-making domains. 

- The paper proposes instruction-tuning Video Pretraining (VPT), a pretrained foundation model for behavior in Minecraft. They aim to make VPT capable of following open-ended text and visual instructions through finetuning.

- The paper introduces an agent called Steve-1, which is created by finetuning VPT using an approach inspired by unCLIP - the method behind DALL-E 2. Specifically, they decompose the problem into a policy model finetuned to achieve visual goals and a prior model that translates text to visual embeddings.

- By leveraging existing pretrained models like VPT and MineCLIP and using techniques like hindsight relabeling and classifier-free guidance, they are able to create an agent that can follow a variety of short-horizon instructions with only around $60 of compute and 2,000 labeled examples. 

- The paper demonstrates Steve-1's performance on a range of tasks and analyses the contributions of different components like pretraining, classifier-free guidance, and prompt engineering.

- The key limitations are the agent's struggle with longer-horizon tasks and the need for prompt engineering. But the approach shows promise in creating inexpensive yet capable instruction-following agents.

In summary, the key focus is on adapting the instruction-tuning approach to sequential decision making by finetuning the pretrained VPT model, using inspiration from unCLIP. The result is an agent with surprisingly strong instruction-following abilities using very limited compute and data.
