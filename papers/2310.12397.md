# [GPT-4 Doesn't Know It's Wrong: An Analysis of Iterative Prompting for   Reasoning Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There has been debate on whether large language models (LLMs) can effectively reason and self-critique to iteratively improve their solutions. This capability would be important for LLMs to robustly solve complex reasoning tasks. 

- Specifically, the paper investigates whether LLMs can effectively solve graph coloring problems through iterative prompting. Graph coloring is an NP-hard constraint satisfaction problem with applications in scheduling and resource allocation.

Methodology:
- The authors systematically test the graph coloring capabilities of GPT-4 in direct prompt and iterative prompt settings. 

- In iterative prompt settings, GPT-4 attempts to critique its own solutions or an external correct reasoner verifies and provides feedback on proposed solutions.

- The impact of the content and correctness of feedback on GPT-4's performance is analyzed. 

Results:
- GPT-4 performs poorly at directly solving graph coloring instances.

- GPT-4 is also ineffective at verifying graph colorings, frequently hallucinating errors.

- Having GPT-4 critique its own solutions via iterative prompting significantly hurts performance.

- Iterative prompting with an external verifier can modestly improve performance, but the content of the feedback does not impact improvements.

- Improvements to iterative prompting stem largely from solutions being present in the top-k prompt completions, rather than effective critiquing.

Conclusions:
- The paper provides evidence against robust reasoning and self-critiquing capabilities in current LLMs. 

- The actual content and correctness of feedback seems irrelevant to iterative prompting performance improvements.

- Overall, the results cast doubt on claims that iterative prompting can enable complex reasoning in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a systematic empirical study questioning claims about the effectiveness of iterative prompting techniques in improving reasoning capabilities of large language models, finding that such models struggle at both solving and verifying solutions for graph coloring problems and that the content of iterative feedback has little effect on performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a systematic investigation of the effectiveness of iterative prompting of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning problems, specifically in the context of graph coloring. The key findings are:

1) LLMs perform poorly at both solving graph coloring instances and verifying candidate solutions. This calls into question their ability to self-critique and improve solutions through iterative prompting.

2) When LLMs self-critique their own solutions, performance actually becomes worse because they fail to recognize when a correct solution is generated and instead provide incorrect feedback. 

3) Iterative prompting with an external correct verifier leads to modest improvements in performance. However, the content and correctness of the feedback seems largely irrelevant - simply having the LLM generate multiple candidate solutions for the verifier to check works nearly as well.

4) The observed effectiveness of iterative prompting appears to stem largely from correct solutions fortuitously appearing in the LLM's top-k completions, rather than any true critiquing or reasoning capability.

In summary, the paper raises significant doubts about claims regarding LLMs' ability to self-critique and improve solutions through iterative prompting. The results underscore the limitations of current LLMs for logical reasoning tasks.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Reasoning abilities
- Graph coloring 
- Iterative prompting
- Self-critiquing
- Verification
- Backprompting
- Constraint satisfaction
- Propositional satisfiability
- Computational complexity
- Approximate retrieval

The paper examines the reasoning abilities of large language models, specifically in the context of the graph coloring problem. It looks at whether iterative prompting, where the model critiques its own solutions, can improve performance. Key aspects studied include the model's ability to verify and provide feedback on solutions, different iterative prompting strategies, and whether improvements are due to the prompting or just having multiple chances to generate solutions. The relation to constraint satisfaction, satisfiability, and computational complexity is also relevant. Overall the paper questions some claims around LLMs' reasoning and self-critiquing capabilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper chooses graph coloring as the reasoning problem to study. What are some key properties of graph coloring that make it a good choice for studying iterative prompting? For example, what makes it readable and easy to verify for humans?

2. The paper compares having the LLM self-critique its solutions versus having an external verifier provide feedback. What are the key differences in these two approaches and why is having an external verifier important? 

3. The paper experimented with different types of backprompting from the external verifier - binary, first error, all errors. Why did they choose to compare these different strategies? What results did they find regarding the impact of the backprompt content?

4. The methodology involves generating random graph coloring instances. What considerations went into choosing the distributions of nodes and edges? How might the distribution impact the complexity of the instances and ability for the LLM to solve them?  

5. The paper experimented with different prompting strategies like higher temperature and asking for multiple solutions. What was the motivation behind trying these alternate strategies? How well did they work compared to iterative backprompting?

6. The results suggest the LLM struggles at verifying solutions itself. What examples support this conclusion? Why might verification be difficult for the LLM?

7. The paper analyzes different types of hallucinations made by the LLM when trying to verify. What are some patterns found regarding different hallucination types? What might these suggest about the LLM's reasoning process?

8. When analyzing backprompts, the paper looks at local error correction rates. Why analyze these rates? What results were found regarding the LLM's response to different backprompt types?

9. The conclusion questions claims about the effectiveness of iterative prompting. What key results from the graph coloring experiments support questioning these claims? 

10. The paper focuses solely on graph coloring. What are some limitations of only studying one reasoning problem? How might the conclusions change if studied on other types of reasoning problems?
