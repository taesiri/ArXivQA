# [VideoSwap: Customized Video Subject Swapping with Interactive Semantic   Point Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02087)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces VideoSwap, a framework for customized video subject swapping that enables shape changes in the swapped subject while preserving the motion trajectory of the source video. The key insight is that only a small number of semantic points, rather than dense correspondence, are necessary to depict the motion trajectory of a subject. VideoSwap allows users to define semantic points on the source video, extracts their trajectories and embeddings, and registers them on the source video to provide motion guidance. To address various semantic correspondences, VideoSwap supports user interactions like removing inaccurate points or dragging points to modify shapes. Built on image and motion diffusion models, VideoSwap blends the swapped subject with the original background using latent blending to focus editing on the foreground. Experiments demonstrate VideoSwapâ€™s state-of-the-art performance in video subject swapping, facilitating shape changes like swapping a dog with a cat or an airplane with a helicopter, while maintaining temporal consistency. The limitations stem from imperfect point tracking and canonical space representation. Future works may explore real-time interactivity, more flexible shape changes, and movie/story generation based on customized video editing.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "VideoSwap: Customized Video Subject Swapping with Interactive Semantic Point Correspondence":

Problem:
- Previous diffusion-based video editing methods rely on dense correspondences (e.g. optical flows, attention maps) to ensure temporal consistency and motion alignment. However, they impose strict shape constraints and are ineffective for video editing tasks involving shape changes. 

- This paper focuses on customized video subject swapping, where the goal is to replace the main subject in a source video with a target subject that has a distinct identity and potentially different shape. This is challenging as it requires aligning the motion trajectory of the source subject while preserving the shape and identity of the target subject.

Method - VideoSwap:
- Key idea: Only a small number of semantic points are necessary to depict the motion trajectory of a subject. These can be used to align motion while allowing shape changes.

- Register semantic points on source video and utilize them to transfer motion trajectory to target edit. Support dragging points to handle shape morphing.

- Add motion layer into image diffusion model to ensure basic temporal consistency.

- Introduce user-point interactions:
   - Use source points directly if full correspondence exists
   - Remove redundant points if partial correspondence
   - Drag points to align shape changes

- Propagate dragged points consistently across frames through learned canonical space of Layered Neural Atlas.

Contributions:
- Empirical observations revealing potential of semantic points for motion alignment and shape editing in videos.  

- VideoSwap framework that utilizes semantic point correspondence for customized video subject swapping with minimal user intervention.

- State-of-the-art results in customized video subject swapping that allows shape changes while aligning motion trajectories.

In summary, this paper proposes VideoSwap to address the task of customized video subject swapping by exploiting semantic point correspondence between source and target subjects. It supports interactive editing like point dragging to handle shape changes.
