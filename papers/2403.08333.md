# [Fast Inference of Removal-Based Node Influence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper proposes a new perspective of evaluating node influence in graphs based on how much the prediction of a trained graph neural network (GNN) model changes when a node is removed from the graph. This allows capturing task-specific node influence. For example, in a Twitter graph, the goal may be to evaluate how much removing a user would influence other users' political polarity predictions. The straightforward way of evaluating this is computationally expensive as it requires retraining the GNN multiple times, once with each node removed. Therefore, an efficient approximation method is needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an efficient method called NOde-Removal-based fAst GNN inference (NORA) to approximate the node influence. The key idea is to analyze how the GNN's predictions change when a node is removed and decompose this change into three intuitive components: 
1) Disappearance of the removed node's representation that serves as messages passed to its neighbors
2) Change in aggregation weights of neighbors of the removed node
3) Spread-out influence on multi-hop neighbors propagated through the GNN layers  

These components are then approximated using the trained GNN model's gradients and some structural properties of the graph like node degrees. This allows estimating the influence of removing any node using just a single forward and backward pass through the GNN, making it highly efficient.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a new perspective of task-specific node influence based on GNN prediction change
- Proposes an efficient approximation method NORA that decomposes the prediction change into intuitive components and uses gradients to estimate them
- Achieves superior efficiency than baseline brute-force method and outperforms adapted node-removal based baselines
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of NORA over multiple GNN models and datasets

The key novelty is in formulating the new node influence perspective tailored to GNN models and the efficient approximation scheme using gradients.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient method called NORA to approximate the influence of removing a node on a graph neural network's predictions, in order to evaluate task-specific node importance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new perspective of evaluating task-specific node influence based on the change in a graph neural network (GNN) model's predictions caused by removing that node. This provides a flexible way to define node influence based on the task.

2. Proposing an efficient and effective method called NORA to approximate the node influence scores for all nodes in the graph simultaneously. It only requires one forward propagation and one backpropagation after the GNN is trained, which is much faster than the brute-force method of removing each node individually.

3. Conducting extensive experiments on six datasets and six GNN models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NORA method in approximating node influence scores compared to adapted baseline methods from graph adversarial attack and counterfactual explanation literature. The results show NORA outperforms the baselines in most cases.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new perspective to evaluate task-specific node influence based on GNN prediction change, as well as an efficient approximation method NORA and demonstrating its effectiveness experimentally.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Graph neural networks (GNNs): The paper uses GNNs as a surrogate model to capture the underlying mechanism of how graph structure affects node behaviors and predictions.

- Node influence: The paper focuses on evaluating task-specific node influence in graphs based on how much the GNN's predictions would change if a node is removed. This is a novel perspective proposed in the paper.

- Node removal: The paper defines node influence based on the change in GNN predictions when removing a node from the graph. This differs from traditional node influence metrics.

- Efficiency: A key focus and contribution of the paper is developing an efficient approximation method called NORA to evaluate node influence without needing to retrain GNNs on modified graphs. 

- Gradient approximations: NORA uses gradients and heuristics to efficiently approximate how GNN predictions change due to node removal. This avoids costly retraining.

- Structural influence: An important component of NORA is approximating the structural influence a node has based on changes in aggregation when it is removed.

- Task-specific influence: The paper emphasizes that node influence should be evaluated in a task-specific manner based on how predictions change for a particular GNN model.

In summary, the key ideas focus on a new perspective of task-specific node influence based on GNN prediction changes, and efficiently approximating that using gradients, structure, and other heuristics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper decomposes the change in GNN predictions caused by node removal into three components (disappearance of node embedding, change of aggregation terms, spread-out influence). Is there a theoretical justification for why these three components fully capture the impact of node removal? Or is it just an intuitive/empirical decomposition?

2. When approximating the disappearance of the node embedding (Term 1), the paper makes an assumption that all nodes are functionally and structurally equal. How much does this assumption impact the accuracy of the approximation? Have you tried to relax this assumption?

3. For Term 2, you use a combination of GCN and GraphSAGE aggregation to approximate the change. Why choose this particular combination? Have you experimented with approximating the aggregation change for other GNN variants like GAT? 

4. When spreading out the influence to previous layers (Term 3), have you theoretically analyzed how the approximation error propagates? Does the error increase, decrease or remain constant as you backpropagate through more layers?

5. The proposed influence score relies on using gradients to approximate the impact of node removal. However, gradients only capture local, first-order effects. Have you experimented with higher-order derivatives or integral approximations to capture global effects? 

6. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of validation set used for tuning hyperparameters? Since you rely on gradients, the directions can be noisy and mislead hyperparameter optimization.

7. You mention the ground truth labels are noisy since the GNN predictions themselves are not perfect. Have you analyzed how robust your method is to noise in the ground truth?

8. For the link prediction task, you still rely on the original GNN model's predictions after node removal. But in reality, the existence of edges may change after removing a node. Should the model be retrained?

9. The run time saving compared to brute force seems to come mainly from avoiding retraining models after node removal. But have you analyzed the memory complexity? Do gradients for all nodes fit in memory for large graphs?

10. You evaluated on a diverse set of datasets and GNN variants. Are there any model architectures or graph properties that could cause the approximation to fail or degrade significantly?
