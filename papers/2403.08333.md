# [Fast Inference of Removal-Based Node Influence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper proposes a new perspective of evaluating node influence in graphs based on how much the prediction of a trained graph neural network (GNN) model changes when a node is removed from the graph. This allows capturing task-specific node influence. For example, in a Twitter graph, the goal may be to evaluate how much removing a user would influence other users' political polarity predictions. The straightforward way of evaluating this is computationally expensive as it requires retraining the GNN multiple times, once with each node removed. Therefore, an efficient approximation method is needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an efficient method called NOde-Removal-based fAst GNN inference (NORA) to approximate the node influence. The key idea is to analyze how the GNN's predictions change when a node is removed and decompose this change into three intuitive components: 
1) Disappearance of the removed node's representation that serves as messages passed to its neighbors
2) Change in aggregation weights of neighbors of the removed node
3) Spread-out influence on multi-hop neighbors propagated through the GNN layers  

These components are then approximated using the trained GNN model's gradients and some structural properties of the graph like node degrees. This allows estimating the influence of removing any node using just a single forward and backward pass through the GNN, making it highly efficient.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates a new perspective of task-specific node influence based on GNN prediction change
- Proposes an efficient approximation method NORA that decomposes the prediction change into intuitive components and uses gradients to estimate them
- Achieves superior efficiency than baseline brute-force method and outperforms adapted node-removal based baselines
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of NORA over multiple GNN models and datasets

The key novelty is in formulating the new node influence perspective tailored to GNN models and the efficient approximation scheme using gradients.
