# [Feudal Networks for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Visual navigation aims to enable agents to navigate like humans without needing detailed maps, but existing methods have limitations such as requiring large amounts of training data, not generalizing well, needing odometry/SLAM, or relying on complex graph representations. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a hierarchical "feudal" navigation framework called FeudalNav consisting of a high-level manager, mid-level manager, and low-level worker.

- The high-level manager maintains a learned 2D map called a "\latentmap" (\latentmapa) that aggregates observations without odometry to provide a notion of where the agent has explored. This is learned in a self-supervised manner using contrastive learning on real trajectory data.

- The mid-level manager consists of a network called \midnet (\midneta) that takes the current observation and \latentmapa as input and predicts a visible point for the agent to move towards, imitating human waypoint selection. \midneta is trained on a new dataset of human teleoperation trajectories in different environments.

- The low-level worker executes motion primitives based on the waypoint from \midneta to actually move the agent.

Main Contributions:

1. Hierarchical "feudal" navigation framework with agents operating at different spatial and temporal scales

2. Self-supervised learning of a 2D \latentmap that serves as a memory and exploration proxy without odometry or graphs

3. \midneta network trained on new dataset of human teleoperation to select waypoints 

4. Public dataset of 103K images with human waypoints during navigation

5. Achieves SOTA performance on image goal navigation in unseen environments with no SLAM or reinforcement learning

In summary, the paper proposes a novel hierarchical approach for visual navigation that avoids many limitations of prior methods by using self-supervised and human trajectory learning within a feudal agent framework. The method achieves strong performance without needing graphs, odometry or interaction with environments.
