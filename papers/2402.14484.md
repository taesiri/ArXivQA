# [Is ChatGPT the Future of Causal Text Mining? A Comprehensive Evaluation   and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14484)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Causal text mining aims to extract causal relations from textual data to derive meaningful insights. With the rapid growth of text data, this capability is increasingly important but also challenging. While encoder models have advanced causal text mining, they require abundant labeled data which is often unavailable. Recently, large language models like ChatGPT exhibited zero/few-shot capabilities in NLP.  The research scope is still limited in causal text mining, and it remains unclear how to effectively employ ChatGPT for causal text mining. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT for causal text mining. It first establishes a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse domains and languages using 9 datasets, along with an evaluation framework tailored for causal text mining. Prompts are carefully designed to enable fair comparisons between ChatGPT and encoder models. Then, the authors performed causal sequence classification and causal span detection tasks. 

Main Results and Contributions:
1. ChatGPT serves as a good starting point across datasets and tasks especially with limited data, but underperforms versus fully trained encoders. Specifically, DeBERTaV3 still dominates when given sufficient data.
2. In-depth analysis reveals challenges of ChatGPT in handling complex causality types (e.g inter-sentential, implicit), false causal recognition, ineffective in-context learning, and limited domain adaptation capabilities. 
3. The paper provides the code, comprehensive benchmark, evaluation framework and analysis to support further research and development of employing LLMs for causal text mining.
