# [A Theory of Topological Derivatives for Inverse Rendering of Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09865)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is:How can we theoretically characterize shape perturbations that allow for discrete topology changes, in order to enable differentiable surface evolution for inverse rendering of geometry?The key hypothesis is that using topological derivatives to relate the introduction of vanishing holes and phases to changes in rendered image intensity will enable differentiable shape perturbations for inverse rendering. This will allow optimization of shapes with complex topology, overcoming limitations of methods relying solely on silhouette gradients.In summary, the paper introduces a theoretical framework using topological derivatives to enable differentiable topology changes for variational optimization of image functionals in the context of inverse rendering and geometry reconstruction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a theoretical framework for introducing topological derivatives into the variational optimization of image functionals for inverse rendering of geometry. The key ideas are:- Deriving shape derivatives for closed curves in 2D and surfaces in 3D using the variational level-set framework. This allows analyzing motion of continuous surfaces. - Introducing topological derivatives (TDs) with respect to infinitesimal perturbations like vanishing holes or phases. The TDs relate changes in image intensity to topological changes in the geometry.- Showing TDs can prompt hole/phase nucleation in regions of high error, enabling topology changes during gradient-based optimization. - Deriving TDs for surfaces in 3D with respect to conical perturbations. This allows measuring visibility changes over the entire surface, not just the silhouette boundaries. - Demonstrating applications in image vectorization, text-to-graphics generation, shape ambigram reconstruction, and multiview 3D reconstruction. The TDs enable recovering shapes with complex topology more robustly compared to using only shape derivatives.In summary, the main contribution is a theoretical framework to incorporate topological derivatives into variational optimization for inverse rendering problems. This enables more reliable topology changes during gradient-based shape evolution.
