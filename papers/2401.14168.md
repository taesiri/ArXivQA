# [Vivim: a Video Vision Mamba for Medical Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14168)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional CNNs have limited receptive fields and cannot effectively capture global spatial information for video object segmentation tasks. Transformer-based methods can model global contexts but suffer from high computational complexity for long video sequences. Therefore, effectively and efficiently capturing spatial and long-range temporal cues poses a key challenge.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Vivim, a video vision mamba framework for medical video object segmentation. It incorporates state space models called Mambas to replace attention modules in transformers to efficiently handle long sequences. 

The main components are:
1) A hierarchical temporal mamba encoder with stacked temporal mamba blocks to extract multi-scale spatial-temporal features from videos in a computationally cheaper way than transformers.

2) A CNN-based decoder to fuse multi-level features and predict segmentation masks.

Key Contributions:
1) First work to introduce mamba models into video object segmentation to address efficiency and long sequence modeling limitations of CNNs and transformers.

2) Proposes a novel temporal mamba block that simultaneously captures spatial and temporal cues by combining a spatial self-attention module with efficient mamba layers.

3) Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a breast ultrasound dataset with improved efficiency over transformer-based methods. Demonstrates effectiveness of incorporating mambas into vision tasks involving long sequences.

In summary, this paper makes key contributions in efficiently handling long video sequences for segmentation by replacing expensive self-attention mechanisms in transformers with cheaper state space model layers called mambas. The proposed Vivim framework outperforms previous methods on a medical dataset.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel framework called Vivim for video object segmentation. Specifically:
