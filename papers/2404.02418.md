# [Auxiliary task demands mask the capabilities of smaller language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02418)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating the underlying capacities of language models (LMs) is challenging because performance on a task depends not just on the model's competence but also its ability to handle the auxiliary demands imposed by the evaluation method.
- Less capable LMs may fail tasks not due to lack of competence but because certain evaluation methods impose too high of demands. This concept of "task demands" masking ability has parallels in developmental psychology.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare evaluation methods that pose higher versus lower auxiliary task demands, across multiple cognitive domains. 
- Test whether the "demand gap" between high-demand and low-demand evaluations shrinks as models increase in general capability, operationalized as number of parameters or training time.

Methods:
- Evaluate two demand contrasts: production vs forced-choice, and metalinguistic judgment vs direct probability measurement. Apply each contrast to two distinct cognitive domains (analogical & reflective reasoning, word prediction & grammar).
- Test open-source LMs spanning 1B to 70B parameters from 5 model families, as well as multiple checkpoints of a 7B parameter model during training.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate the signature "demand gap" shrinking for more capable models across tasks and models. Suggests high-demand methods may mask abilities of smaller or less trained LMs.  
- Connect findings to emergence and interpretability over the course of model training.
- Highlight evaluation validity as critical for studying cognition in LMs. Encourage researchers to consider interactions between evaluation methods and goals when designing or interpreting benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how auxiliary task demands imposed by evaluation methods can disproportionately mask the abilities of smaller language models, producing larger performance gaps between high-demand and low-demand evaluations as compared to large models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that evaluation methods with higher task demands lead to lower performance for language models, especially those with fewer parameters or less training. Specifically, the paper shows that the "demand gap" between high-demand and low-demand evaluation methods shrinks as models increase in size and training time. This suggests that task demands can mask the abilities of less capable models, and that inferences about language model capacities depend on the choice of evaluation metric. The paper concludes by encouraging researchers to consider the validity of evaluation methods and interpret model performance as a reflection of capacities seen through the lens of research design choices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Task demands - Auxiliary challenges associated with performing an evaluation that may mask an agent's true underlying abilities. A key concept from developmental psychology that is applied to language models.

- Evaluation validity - The degree to which a particular evaluation method appropriately measures the construct or capacity it aims to assess. A major focus of the paper.

- Demand gap - The performance gap between high demand and low demand evaluation methods. The paper investigates how this gap changes as a function of model scale and training time. 

- Production vs forced choice - One of the evaluation contrasts explored, comparing generation of responses vs discrimination between response options.

- Metalinguistic judgments vs probability measurements - Another evaluation contrast explored, comparing explicit grammaticality judgments vs direct measures of string probability. 

- Model scale - Number of parameters. One way the paper manipulates general model capacity.

- Training time - Alternate way to operationalize improvements in model capacity over "development".

The paper connects these concepts to argue that evaluation methods interact with model scale and training time in determining what abilities are revealed, with implications for understanding language models' capacities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that task demands asymmetrically affect less capable language models. What specific mechanisms could explain why smaller or less trained models struggle more with auxiliary task demands? Can we characterize or quantify these demands more precisely? 

2. The paper focuses on two types of evaluation contrasts: production vs forced choice, and metalinguistic judgment vs probability measurement. What other evaluation method contrasts would be useful to study from the perspective of task demands? For example, what predictions might we have about in-context learning or chain-of-thought prompting?

3. The paper argues that reducing task demands enables a more direct inference about constructs of interest. However, lower-demand tasks are not necessarily easier or more lenient. What concrete standards or criteria could researchers use to determine whether a given evaluation has appropriately low demands for measuring a construct? 

4. The paper finds that the signature "demand gap" pattern does not emerge as clearly within the Pythia model family as it does in other tested models. What differences in Pythia's architecture, scale, or training might explain this result? How might the pattern look at even larger scales?  

5. The paper focuses on model scale and training time as ways to manipulate general language modeling capabilities. Are there other ways to operationalize model "development" that might provide additional insights into the effects of task demands?

6. The paper does not make strong claims about developmental parallels between children and neural language models. But are there any concrete insights from this work that could inform hypotheses about evaluating cognitive abilities in children?

7. The concept of task demands originated from developmental psychology. Could insights from differences in evaluation methods for language models actually help illuminate phenomena in children? If so, how?

8. The paper relies on an informal notion of what makes a particular task demand high versus low. What types of computational analyses or behavioral experiments could help formally characterize different sources of task demands? 

9. The paper argues that researchers should be aware of task demands when interpreting model performance, but notes that no single evaluation method is the "right" one. What principles or guidelines could help researchers select appropriate methods aligned with their goals?

10. The paper focuses solely on evaluating model performance, but task demands likely also affect metrics related to fairness, safety, and societal impact. How might findings translate to mitigating issues in those areas?
