# [Multi-Bit Distortion-Free Watermarking for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate human-like text, enabling misuse. To ensure accountability, it's important to trace text provenance - i.e. determine if text was AI-generated and if so, identify the model used. 

- Existing methods for "watermarking" LLMs to enable provenance tracking distort the text, exposing the watermark. Recent "distortion-free" methods use secret keys for watermark detection but only encode a 0-bit watermark indicating AI origin.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops the first efficient multi-bit distortion-free watermarking scheme that embeds metadata (e.g. model name/version) as part of watermark.

- Extends an existing 0-bit distortion-free method by generalizing to a multi-bit watermark mapping rule that partitions the sample space based on embedded bits. Ensures watermarked text distribution matches original LLM.

- Proposes an efficient Distribution Interval Shift Coding (DISC) algorithm for multi-bit distortion-free watermarking that shifts the conditional token probability distribution based on embedded bits.  

- Develops a computationally efficient decoder to extract embedded information with low bit error rate, without needing exhaustive search over all possibilities.

Main Contributions:
- First multi-bit distortion-free LLM watermarking scheme that maintains text quality.

- Efficient decoding algorithm for extracting embedded information. Overall runs in O(L^2) vs. exponential in number of embedded bits.

- Analyzes false positive and false negative rates, proves distortion-free property. Derives bounds on minimum marked text length.

- Simulation results validate low bit error rate in extracting multi-bit watermarks for given text lengths.

In summary, the paper enables embedding useful metadata as part of distortion-free LLM watermarks, with efficient decoding, to support accountability while maintaining text quality.
