# [Factorized Explainer for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) are gaining popularity for learning from graph data, but they lack interpretability due to their "black box" nature. 
- Existing methods use the Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle to find "minimal and sufficient" subgraphs that explain GNN predictions. 
- However, the paper shows analytically that for many tasks, GIB admits trivial solutions where the explanation subgraph signals the predicted label but is independent of the actual input graph. So GIB does not fully capture the notion of explainability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a modified GIB principle to avoid the trivial signaling solutions. This uses cross-entropy between the predicted and true labels based on the explanation subgraph.
- It also proposes a novel K-FactExplainer method based on factorizing the explanation function to address issues of locality and lossy aggregation in GNNs:
  - Locality issue: Existing parametric explainers are local, struggling on graphs with multiple motifs influencing the label. 
  - Lossy aggregation: GNN aggregation loses information, affecting explanation accuracy.
- The K-FactExplainer combines multiple local "weak" explainers into a stronger global explainer using an additional MLP.

Main Contributions:
- First analytical demonstration of issues with using GIB principle for GNN explainability.
- A modified GIB objective that better captures explainability.
- Identification of locality and lossy aggregation issues limiting existing parametric explainers.
- A new factorized explainer method that mitigates these issues and improves explanation accuracy.
- Extensive experiments validating improved performance over state-of-the-art on both synthetic and real-world graphs.

In summary, the paper provides important analytical insights into limitations of prior work on GNN explainability, and proposes a novel factorized explanation approach that consistently improves explanation accuracy across tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a factorized explanation model called K-FactExplainer to improve the faithfulness of explanations for graph neural networks by addressing issues with locality and lossy aggregation in prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It points out for the first time that there is a non-negligible gap between the practical objective function (GIB) and the high-level objective in the popular post-hoc explanation framework for graph neural networks.

2. It derives a generalized framework to unify existing parametric explanation methods and theoretically analyzes their pitfalls in achieving accurate explanations in complicated real-life datasets. The paper further proposes a straightforward explanation method with a solid theoretical foundation to achieve better generalization capacity.

3. Comprehensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-life datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can dramatically and consistently improve the quality of the explanations compared to existing methods.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying issues with existing GNN explanation methods, both theoretically and empirically, and proposing a new method called "K-FactExplainer" that improves explanation performance through a factorized model designed to address those issues. The gains are validated through experiments on multiple datasets.

The main focus of the paper is on developing a new factorized explanation model called "K-FactExplainer" to address limitations in using the graph information bottleneck principle for explaining graph neural network predictions. The key ideas have to do with avoiding trivial/uninformative explanations, handling multiple motifs in graphs, and mitigating locality and lossy aggregation issues. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real graph datasets using both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper points out two key issues with existing graph neural network explanation methods: locality and lossy aggregation. Can you elaborate on what exactly these issues are and how they lead to suboptimal explanations?

2. The paper proposes a modified graph information bottleneck (GIB) principle to avoid trivial solutions in GNN explanations. How exactly is this modified from the original GIB formulation? What additional theoretical guarantees does the modified version provide?

3. The paper introduces a factorized explanation model to address limitations of existing methods. Can you walk through the architecture and key components of this model? How does it aim to mitigate locality and lossy aggregation issues? 

4. Proposition 2 provides an algorithm to upper bound the number of MLPs needed in the proposed K-FactExplainer method. Can you explain this bootstrapping algorithm in more detail? How does it estimate the number of motifs to set the hyperparameter k?

5. Theoretical analysis in the paper indicates suboptimality of local explanation methods in multi-motif classification tasks. Can you summarize the key arguments made to support this claim? How does the proposed method overcome this limitation?

6. Lossy aggregation is identified as one reason for suboptimal GNN explanations. How do the experiments involving single-motif classification tasks illustrate that the proposed method mitigates aggregation loss?

7. How do the experiments on multi-motif datasets demonstrate gains of the proposed approach in overcoming locality limitations of existing methods? Can you walk through some of the key results?

8. The proposed method introduces additional parameters compared to baseline approaches. How does this impact computational efficiency? What do the results in Table 5 indicate?

9. Could the proposed factorized explanation framework be extended to provide model-level explanations in addition to instance-level explanations currently? What challenges need to be addressed?

10. Qualitative results in Table 6 provide some visualization comparisons. Can you analyze and compare explanation subgraphs shown for different methods? How do results align with quantitative gains reported?
