# [Deep TAMER: Interactive Agent Shaping in High-Dimensional State Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:What is the impact of using deep neural networks on the effectiveness of learning from real-time, scalar-valued human feedback in high-dimensional state spaces?Specifically, the paper proposes an extension of the TAMER framework called Deep TAMER that leverages deep neural networks to enable TAMER to work in high-dimensional state spaces like raw pixel inputs. The key hypothesis is that using deep neural networks as function approximators in TAMER will allow it to successfully learn from human feedback even in environments with high-dimensional state spaces, where the original linear TAMER models struggle. The experiments on the Atari bowling game are designed to test this hypothesis by comparing Deep TAMER against the original TAMER on a task with raw pixel input states.So in summary, the main research question is whether deep neural networks can enable more effective human feedback-based learning in high-dimensional environments compared to prior approaches like linear TAMER models. The Deep TAMER method is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an extension of the TAMER (Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement) framework called Deep TAMER, which enables it to work in environments with high-dimensional state spaces. Specifically, the paper:- Proposes using a deep neural network reward model instead of a linear model to approximate the human trainer's reward function in high-dimensional state spaces like images.- Pre-trains the CNN portion of the reward model using an autoencoder to reduce the number of parameters that need to be learned during human training.- Uses a feedback replay buffer to increase the learning rate from human rewards. - Evaluates Deep TAMER on the challenging Atari Bowling game with pixel-level input and shows it can train successful agents in just 15 minutes of human interaction, outperforming human trainers, standard TAMER, and deep reinforcement learning methods.So in summary, the main contribution is augmenting the TAMER framework with techniques like deep neural network function approximation and experience replay to make it work well in high-dimensional state spaces, enabling fast training of agents by non-expert humans even on complex tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes Deep TAMER, an extension of the TAMER framework that uses deep neural networks to enable real-time human training of agents in high-dimensional state spaces.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on Deep TAMER compares to other related research:- It builds directly on the prior TAMER framework but proposes enhancements to make it work in high-dimensional state spaces like images. This compares to prior TAMER work that was limited to low-dimensional state spaces. - It shows Deep TAMER agents can learn from just 15 minutes of human interaction to exceed human performance on a challenging task. This compares favorably to deep reinforcement learning methods like DQN/A3C that require millions of training steps.- It demonstrates interactive learning from critiques alone, without requiring expert demonstrations. This differs from imitation learning methods that rely on demonstration data.- It learns in real-time interaction without needing a simulator, unlike some other human-in-the-loop approaches. This could be advantageous for real-world applications.- The proposed deep neural network reward model is tailored for learning from sparse human feedback. This differs from end-to-end deep RL that learns policies directly.- Pretraining the autoencoder and using experience replay are innovations over prior TAMER methods to enable deep neural networks. This draws inspiration from deep RL.In summary, Deep TAMER uniquely combines human interaction with deep representation learning to achieve efficient learning from non-expert human feedback in high-dimensional tasks. The comparisons show advantages over both standard deep RL and prior human-in-the-loop techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Experimenting with Deep TAMER in more environments and with different hyperparameter settings. The authors only evaluated Deep TAMER on the Atari Bowling game due to the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of human interaction data. They suggest experimenting in more domains and with different hyperparameters.- Comparing different neural network architectures and training techniques for the reward model. The authors used a particular deep neural network architecture and training method, but suggest exploring others as well.- Investigating different strategies for incorporating human feedback. The authors used a particular way of integrating the human rewards into the loss function during training. They suggest exploring other techniques for using the human feedback.- Studying how to make Deep TAMER more sample efficient. While Deep TAMER achieves good results with limited data, making it more sample efficient could further reduce the amount of human interaction time needed.- Exploring methods to make Deep TAMER more stable and noise-tolerant. The authors note the learning curves were noisy likely due to the stochastic optimization, suggesting studying ways to improve stability.- Analyzing the impact of different types of human trainers and feedback strategies. The authors used a particular experimental setup with non-expert trainers, but suggest analyzing how expert trainers or different training strategies could impact Deep TAMER's performance.In summary, the main future directions focus on broadening the evaluation of Deep TAMER, tweaking the training methodology, and analyzing how different human interaction factors influence the overall approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes an extension of the TAMER framework called Deep TAMER that enables agents to learn complex tasks from real-time human feedback even in high-dimensional state spaces. Deep TAMER uses a deep neural network to model the human trainer's reward function and a modified supervised learning procedure to train it. The authors evaluated Deep TAMER on the Atari game Bowling and found that after just 15 minutes of human interaction, agents trained with Deep TAMER significantly outperformed agents trained with the original TAMER framework, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods given much more training data, and even the human trainers themselves in most cases. The results demonstrate Deep TAMER's ability to leverage deep learning to enable efficient human-in-the-loop training in complex, high-dimensional environments.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes an extension of the TAMER framework called Deep TAMER that enables agents to learn from real-time human interaction even in environments with high-dimensional state spaces. The key idea is to use a deep neural network to represent the human trainer's reward function. The neural network has a convolutional front end pre-trained as an autoencoder to extract useful features from high-dimensional sensory inputs. The fully-connected back end of the network represents the human's preferences. Stochastic gradient descent with importance weighting is used to update the network parameters based on the human feedback. A replay buffer allows more frequent updates than the human provides feedback. The method is evaluated on training agents to play Atari Bowling using pixel-level input images. After just 15 minutes of human training, Deep TAMER agents exceed the performance of agents trained with deep reinforcement learning and millions of frames of experience. In most cases, the Deep TAMER agents even outperform the human trainers themselves. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Deep TAMER for learning in high-dimensional state spaces with limited human interaction. The results also showcase the potential of human-in-the-loop training to achieve super-human performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a technique called Deep TAMER, which is an extension of the TAMER (Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement) framework for training autonomous agents through real-time interaction with human trainers. The key method is to use a deep neural network to model the human trainer's reward function in environments with high-dimensional state spaces like images. The deep neural network has a convolutional neural network (CNN) frontend that is pre-trained as an autoencoder to encode the image states. The backend is a fully-connected network with an output node per action that predicts the human's reward signal. They use an importance-weighted loss function to train this "deep reward model" with stochastic gradient descent. The loss weights recent agent experience higher to reflect the trainer's intent. A replay buffer stores experience to allow faster training with mini-batches. The trained deep network predicts the human reward signal and drives the agent's behavior policy during interactive training. They evaluate Deep TAMER on the Atari game Bowling and show it can learn better policies than humans and deep reinforcement learning methods.
