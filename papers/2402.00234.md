# [Are Generative AI systems Capable of Supporting Information Needs of   Patients?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Patients and caregivers face complex challenges in understanding medical terminology, scan images, and radiology reports when diagnosed with serious illnesses like cancer. 
- Interacting with healthcare experts can help improve understanding but takes up limited expert time. 
- Recently, conversational generative AI models have shown promise in providing information through natural conversations.
- However, evaluating if these models can responsibly address patients' diverse information needs remains an open question.

Study and Analysis:
- Authors conducted a formative study where participants discussed chest CT scans/reports of a relative with a radiologist. 
- Identified 10 themes of information needs through thematic analysis of conversations.
- Evaluated two state-of-the-art visual QA models (MedFlamingo and ChatGPT-4V) for 4 key themes.
- Found high error rates in factual correctness of responses (70% for MedFlamingo, 35% for ChatGPT-4V).
- Identified deficiencies in relevance of responses generated.

Contributions:
- Identified variety of informational needs patients have around understanding scans and reports.
- Proposed new qualitative evaluation approach for generative AI systems based on real-world human conversations and needs.
- Showed current visual QA models have limitations in responsibly addressing patients' informational needs.
- Laid groundwork for developing accounts evaluation benchmarks and intelligent assistive systems for healthcare.

Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary. I aimed to capture the key points as concisely as possible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates whether current state-of-the-art generative AI systems can reliably and meaningfully support patients in understanding their medical scans and reports by conducting a formative study of patient-radiologist interactions, identifying common themes that arise, and assessing two models on their ability to correctly and relevantly respond to real patient questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A formative need-finding study of patient-provider interactions to understand the information needs of patients and caregivers as they attempt to understand medical scans and reports. The study identified 10 themes that comprise such conversations.

2. An evaluation of two state-of-the-art generative AI models - MedFlamingo and ChatGPT-4V - on their ability to address patient information needs across 4 key themes identified in the study. 

3. A qualitative analysis framework to evaluate generative AI systems on two dimensions - correctness and relevance.

4. Key findings that highlight deficiencies in current generative models in being able to reliably and usefully address patient informational needs. The models had high error rates and struggled with providing focused, relevant responses.

5. A proposal for an evaluation approach grounded in real-world human needs rather than curated datasets that can guide the development of generative models to be more accountable and transparent.

In summary, the main contribution is a human-centered evaluation approach for generative AI that reveals limitations in the state-of-the-art's readiness to address patient needs. The paper makes the case for task-specific assessments aligned with social needs these models purportedly address.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Generative AI/generative AI systems
- Healthcare/medicine
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Visual question answering
- Evaluation/analysis 
- Patient information needs
- Patient-provider interaction
- Thematic analysis
- Conversational themes
- Correctness and relevance (evaluation criteria)

The paper evaluates two generative AI systems - MedFlamingo and ChatGPT-4V - on their ability to support patients' informational needs by engaging in conversations around medical scans and reports. It conducts a formative study to analyze real patient-provider conversations and identify key conversational themes that come up. It then structures an evaluation using some of those themes to assess the factual correctness and relevance of the AI systems' responses compared to expert radiologists. The key findings highlight deficiencies in current state-of-the-art systems in addressing patients' diverse information needs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper conducts a formative study with 5 participants and a radiologist. What considerations went into determining this small sample size? Could the themes identified generalize to a broader population?

2. The paper uses inductive thematic analysis to identify 10 themes from the participant-radiologist interactions. What steps were taken during coding to ensure inter-rater reliability? How was agreement measured between coders?  

3. The paper evaluates two generative AI models on 4 selected themes. What criteria were used to select these specific themes for evaluation? Could the remaining themes also be formulated into question-answer pairs for evaluation?

4. The evaluation uses a qualitative paradigm considering correctness and relevance. Could these constructs be operationalized to allow quantitative measurement? What would be required?

5. The paper notes that the questions asked during evaluation were paraphrased for clarity compared to how they were originally asked. To what extent could this impact the evaluation if models struggle with conversational language?  

6. The radiologist annotations on scans played an important role during interviews. How were the AI models designed/prompted to account for referring to visual evidence in their responses?

7. When determining correctness, any factual inaccuracy led to judging a response as incorrect. However, responses also contained accurate statements. Should partial credit be considered? What are the tradeoffs?

8. For relevance, different types of elaborations were identified. Did specific types of elaborations make a response more or less useful? Were there differences between models?

9. The radiologist's responses demonstrated mixed-initiative dialog with elaboration aimed at educating the patient. Should this be an expectation for AI systems as well? What challenges does it present?

10. The limitations highlight need for task-specific evaluation aligned with real-world usage. What processes could be used to develop such benchmarks and quantify if AI systems meet patientsâ€™ needs?
