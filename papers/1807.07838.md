# [TESSERACT: Eliminating Experimental Bias in Malware Classification   across Space and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07838)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Android malware classification has reported very high performance (F1 scores up to 0.99), but these results are likely biased due to unrealistic assumptions in experimental settings.
- Two key sources of bias are identified: 
  (1) Spatial bias: Unrealistic malware-to-goodware ratios in training and testing
  (2) Temporal bias: Temporally inconsistent splits of training/testing data
- These biases cause performance inflation of up to 50% compared to a realistic setting.

Solution:
- Formally define spatio-temporal constraints for unbiased evaluation:
  C1) Temporal training consistency 
  C2) Temporal goodware/malware windows consistency
  C3) Realistic malware percentage in testing
- Introduce a new time-aware performance metric, AUT, to capture classifier robustness to time decay 
- Propose a tuning algorithm to optimize malware F1/Precision/Recall subject to a maximum tolerated error
- Implement an open-source framework, TESSERACT, to evaluate Android malware classifiers without spatial/temporal biases

Contributions:  
- Identify and quantify sources of experimental bias in Android malware classification
- Formally define constraints and metrics for unbiased, comparable evaluations
- Algorithm to tune classifier performance for the minority malware class  
- TESSERACT framework to facilitate further research towards more robust malware classifiers
- Case study with TESSERACT revealing counter-intuitive performance of DREBIN, MaMaDroid and DL classifiers after debiasing  

Overall, the paper makes a strong case that current evaluation practices in Android malware classification are positively biased. By identifying specific sources of bias, proposing constraints to enable unbiased evaluation, and releasing an open-source framework, the authors aim to encourage more rigorous evaluation standards and progress towards more robust malware classifiers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies and addresses sources of spatial and temporal experimental bias that can artificially inflate the performance of Android malware classifiers, proposes constraints and metrics for unbiased evaluation, and releases Tesseract, an open-source framework implementing these solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It identifies two key sources of experimental bias in Android malware classification: temporal bias (due to violations of temporal consistency between training and testing data) and spatial bias (due to unrealistic assumptions about malware vs goodware ratios).

2) It proposes a set of constraints (C1, C2, C3) that need to be satisfied to eliminate temporal and spatial bias.

3) It introduces a new metric called Area Under Time (AUT) to summarize the expected robustness of a classifier to time decay into a single number.

4) It presents an algorithm to tune the training malware percentage to optimize desired performance metrics like F1 score, precision, recall etc. while respecting a tolerable error rate. 

5) It implements the solutions in an open source framework called TESSERACT to enable fair comparisons between Android malware classifiers in realistic settings.

6) It demonstrates the framework by evaluating and comparing various classifiers like Drebin, MaMaDroid, etc., showing counterintuitive results and significant performance differences compared to biased settings.

In summary, the main contribution is the identification and quantification of experimental bias, proposal of constraints/metrics/algorithms to eliminate it, and the implementation to demonstrate its impact on classifier evaluation.

The paper discusses sources of bias (spatial and temporal) that can artificially inflate performance results in Android malware classification. It proposes constraints, metrics like AUT, and tools to enable realistic, unbiased evaluations that account for concept drift. Key ideas involve tuning the malware ratio in training data, comparing classifier performance over time, and evaluating strategies to delay time decay.
