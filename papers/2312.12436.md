# [A Challenger to GPT-4V? Early Explorations of Gemini in Visual Expertise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement & Motivation
- There has been growing interest in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V that fuse text and visual modalities. Recently, Google introduced Gemini, a new powerful MLLM rivaling GPT-4V. This paper explores whether Gemini can challenge GPT-4V's leading position in multi-modal learning.

Methods 
- The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Gemini Pro, GPT-4V, and Sphinx (an open-source MLLM) across diverse qualitative samples and a quantitative benchmark (MME). 
- The qualitative evaluation covers four visual domains - fundamental perception, advanced cognition, challenging vision tasks, and expert capacities with specialized fields.
- The MME benchmark has 14 subtasks assessing perception and cognition abilities.

Results & Observations
- Qualitative: Gemini exhibits comparable visual reasoning to GPT-4V but different answering styles - Gemini gives direct concise responses while GPT-4V provides more detailed analysis. Both significantly outperform Sphinx.  
- Common issues: Inadequate spatial perception, unsatisfactory OCR & abstract reasoning, logical inconsistencies, sensitivity to prompts.
- Quantitative: On MME benchmark, Gemini narrowly beats GPT-4V, with Sphinx lagging behind. GPT-4V dominates cognition tasks.  

Conclusions
- Gemini is a strong challenger to GPT-4V given impressive multi-modal reasoning, but neither model achieves artificial general intelligence. 
- Open-source Sphinx still trails significantly behind Gemini and GPT-4V.
- Future MLLM progress should target visual representation, multi-modal alignment and reasoning capacity.

In summary, while Gemini rivals GPT-4V, showcasing the rapid progress of MLLMs, there remains substantial scope to advance towards robust and comprehensive multi-modal understanding.
