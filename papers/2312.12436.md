# [A Challenger to GPT-4V? Early Explorations of Gemini in Visual Expertise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement & Motivation
- There has been growing interest in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V that fuse text and visual modalities. Recently, Google introduced Gemini, a new powerful MLLM rivaling GPT-4V. This paper explores whether Gemini can challenge GPT-4V's leading position in multi-modal learning.

Methods 
- The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Gemini Pro, GPT-4V, and Sphinx (an open-source MLLM) across diverse qualitative samples and a quantitative benchmark (MME). 
- The qualitative evaluation covers four visual domains - fundamental perception, advanced cognition, challenging vision tasks, and expert capacities with specialized fields.
- The MME benchmark has 14 subtasks assessing perception and cognition abilities.

Results & Observations
- Qualitative: Gemini exhibits comparable visual reasoning to GPT-4V but different answering styles - Gemini gives direct concise responses while GPT-4V provides more detailed analysis. Both significantly outperform Sphinx.  
- Common issues: Inadequate spatial perception, unsatisfactory OCR & abstract reasoning, logical inconsistencies, sensitivity to prompts.
- Quantitative: On MME benchmark, Gemini narrowly beats GPT-4V, with Sphinx lagging behind. GPT-4V dominates cognition tasks.  

Conclusions
- Gemini is a strong challenger to GPT-4V given impressive multi-modal reasoning, but neither model achieves artificial general intelligence. 
- Open-source Sphinx still trails significantly behind Gemini and GPT-4V.
- Future MLLM progress should target visual representation, multi-modal alignment and reasoning capacity.

In summary, while Gemini rivals GPT-4V, showcasing the rapid progress of MLLMs, there remains substantial scope to advance towards robust and comprehensive multi-modal understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-modal capabilities of three language models - Gemini, GPT-4V, and Sphinx - across diverse tasks in perception, cognition, vision, and expert domains, finding that while Gemini and GPT-4V showcase impressive performance and different strengths, all models still have limitations, indicating there remains considerable progress to be made towards artificial general intelligence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of three powerful multi-modal large language models - Gemini Pro, GPT-4V, and Sphinx. The key contributions are:

1) A diverse set of qualitative samples covering four domains - fundamental perception, advanced cognition, challenging vision tasks, and expert capacities. Each domain contains several subtasks for in-depth analysis.

2) Quantitative evaluation on the MME benchmark with 14 subtasks to measure the models' perception and cognition capabilities. 

3) In-depth discussion comparing Gemini and GPT-4V. The results show they achieve competitive performance, with different answering styles and preferences. Gemini tends to give more direct and concise responses, while GPT-4V provides detailed reasoning steps. 

4) Analysis of the gaps between Sphinx and the other two models, showing that open-source MLLMs still lag behind closed-source systems. Sphinx struggles in some complex tasks due to limitations in training data diversity and reasoning capacity.

5) Identification of common issues of current MLLMs concerning spatial relation awareness, OCR accuracy, logical consistency, and prompting robustness. There remains much room for improvement towards artificial general intelligence.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive benchmarking study between cutting-edge MLLMs using both qualitative analysis and quantitative metrics. The results provide valuable insights to guide future MLLM research.
