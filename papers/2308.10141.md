# [March in Chat: Interactive Prompting for Remote Embodied Referring   Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10141)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we enable an agent to successfully navigate and ground objects in the Remote Embodied Referring Expression (REVERIE) environment using only high-level, concise instructions, by leveraging large language models?

The key points are:

- REVERIE requires navigation and object grounding using only high-level instructions like "Empty the washing machine on level one", which is challenging. 

- Existing methods designed for detailed step-by-step instructions do not perform well on REVERIE.

- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for action planning in embodied tasks when provided suitable prompts. 

- But using LLMs to plan for complex REVERIE environments with diverse rooms/objects is still an open problem.

- This paper proposes a new model called March-in-Chat (MiC) that allows the agent to interactively query the LLM to generate plans tailored to the current environment.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by enabling dynamic interaction between the agent and LLM, the LLM's knowledge can be leveraged to successfully navigate in REVERIE environments given only high-level instructions. The proposed MiC model aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel March-in-Chat (MiC) model, which lets the REVERIE agent talk with a Large Language Model (LLM) on the fly to make plans for navigating the next few steps. 

2. It introduces two planning modules - Goal-Oriented Static Planning (GOSP) and Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning (SODP), as well as a Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver (ROASP) module.

3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REVERIE benchmark, outperforming prior methods by a large margin of 3.09% in terms of the SPL navigation metric and 3.49% on the RGSPL object grounding metric.

4. It conducts extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the different components in MiC and shows the benefits of incorporating dynamic scene-aware perception into the planning process.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the March-in-Chat model to enable an agent to interactively talk with an LLM to generate dynamic plans conditioned on visual scene perceptions for the challenging REVERIE task. The strong experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this interactive planning approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a March-in-Chat model to enable REVERIE navigation agents to dynamically generate navigation plans via dialogue with a large language model, using a room-and-object aware scene perceiver and goal-oriented plus scene-oriented planning modules, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the REVERIE benchmark.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of vision-and-language navigation:

- This paper focuses specifically on the REVERIE task, which involves navigating to a target object using only high-level, concise instructions. Many other VLN papers tackle tasks like R2R and RxR that provide more detailed step-by-step instructions. So this work is novel in developing methods tailored for REVERIE's more challenging setting.

- The key idea proposed is to have an agent "talk" to a large language model (LLM) on the fly to generate navigation plans dynamically based on environmental observations. This idea of interactive prompting with an LLM planner is quite new and hasn't been explored much for VLN tasks before. 

- The paper introduces several novel components like the Goal-Oriented Static Planning module, Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning module, and Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver. These contribute to the interactive prompting idea and help the agent leverage the LLM's knowledge.

- The proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results on the REVERIE benchmark, outperforming prior work by a large margin of 3-4% on the main metrics. This demonstrates the benefits of the interactive LLM prompting approach.

- Compared to some concurrent works that also use LLMs for planning but mainly on simpler environments/tasks, this paper tackles the more complex REVERIE setting with larger spaces and more diverse scenes and objects.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights on the contributions of different components. The qualitative analysis also helps understand the model's behavior.

Overall, the interactive prompting of an LLM planner based on environmental awareness is an interesting idea for VLN that this paper explores well. The strong results on REVERIE highlight the promise of this approach compared to prior work. The comparisons show the paper makes solid contributions to advancing research on this challenging task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different prompt engineering techniques and prompt formats to further improve the performance of using LLMs for planning in VLN tasks. The authors mention that both the prompt template design and choice of demonstration examples impact the effectiveness of in-context learning.

- Adapting the proposed methods to other VLN tasks beyond REVERIE, such as R2R, R4R, and TouchDown. The authors suggest their interactive prompting approach could be beneficial for other VLN setups.

- Improving the scene-aware perception module to provide even richer environmental context to the LLM planner. The authors suggest enhancing the room type and visible object detection to enable more dynamic planning.

- Incorporating other modalities beyond visual observations into the prompts for the LLM, such as depth, audio, or tactile data. The multi-modal context could improve the planner. 

- Exploring different LLMs beyond GPT-2, such as more recent and larger models like GPT-3 and Codex. Scaling up the LLM size could improve planning performance.

- Evaluating the generalizability of the approach to real-world robot platforms beyond the simulator. Testing the method on physical robots could be an important next step.

- Analyzing failure cases and debuggingprompting strategies to improve the robustness. The authors suggest further human evaluations.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improvements to the prompting methodology, enhancing the environmental perception module, scaling up the approach, and testing on more VLN setups and physical robots. The interactive prompting paradigm shows promise.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel model called March-in-Chat (MiC) for the REVERIE embodied vision-and-language navigation task. REVERIE provides high-level, concise instructions to navigate and locate objects in large indoor environments. MiC enables an agent to dynamically talk with a large language model (LLM) to generate a detailed step-by-step navigation plan based on the instruction and visual observations. It consists of three main modules - a Goal-Oriented Static Planning module that identifies the target object and likely room from the instruction using the LLM's world knowledge, a Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver module that extracts room type and visible objects from visual input, and a Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning module that interacts with the LLM to generate a navigation plan conditioned on the perceived scene. Experiments show MiC significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the REVERIE benchmark. The interactive prompting of the LLM for dynamic planning based on visual perception is the key contribution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel model called March in Chat (MiC) for the REVERIE embodied navigation and object grounding task. REVERIE provides agents with only high-level, concise instructions to navigate to target objects in large, open environments. This is challenging compared to other vision-and-language navigation tasks that give more detailed step-by-step instructions. 

MiC enables an agent to dynamically talk with a large language model (LLM) to generate plans for the next few steps. It consists of three main modules: 1) Goal-Oriented Static Planning (GOSP) which identifies the target object and likely room location using the LLM's world knowledge, 2) Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver (ROASP) which perceives the current room type and visible objects, and 3) Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning (SODP) which generates detailed step plans based on ROASP's perception and by interacting with the LLM. Experiments on the REVERIE benchmark show MiC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods by large margins on navigation and object grounding metrics. This demonstrates MiC's effectiveness at leveraging an LLM's knowledge to plan dynamically based on environmental perceptions for completing long-horizon embodied tasks.

The paper proposes a novel model called March-in-Chat (MiC) for the REVERIE embodied navigation and object grounding task. REVERIE only provides high-level instructions to the agent, which makes it challenging. MiC enables the agent to talk with a large language model (LLM) on the fly to generate detailed step-by-step plans. It has three main modules - Goal-Oriented Static Planning (GOSP) identifies the target object and likely room using the LLM's world knowledge; Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver (ROASP) perceives the current room type and visible objects; Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning (SODP) prompts the LLM again using ROASP's perception to generate a new navigation plan when the scene changes. By combining goal-oriented static planning and dynamic scene-aware planning with an LLM, MiC allows the agent to effectively navigate large unseen environments given high-level instructions.
