# March in Chat: Interactive Prompting for Remote Embodied Referring   Expression

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we enable an agent to successfully navigate and ground objects in the Remote Embodied Referring Expression (REVERIE) environment using only high-level, concise instructions, by leveraging large language models?The key points are:- REVERIE requires navigation and object grounding using only high-level instructions like "Empty the washing machine on level one", which is challenging. - Existing methods designed for detailed step-by-step instructions do not perform well on REVERIE.- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for action planning in embodied tasks when provided suitable prompts. - But using LLMs to plan for complex REVERIE environments with diverse rooms/objects is still an open problem.- This paper proposes a new model called March-in-Chat (MiC) that allows the agent to interactively query the LLM to generate plans tailored to the current environment.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by enabling dynamic interaction between the agent and LLM, the LLM's knowledge can be leveraged to successfully navigate in REVERIE environments given only high-level instructions. The proposed MiC model aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel March-in-Chat (MiC) model, which lets the REVERIE agent talk with a Large Language Model (LLM) on the fly to make plans for navigating the next few steps. 2. It introduces two planning modules - Goal-Oriented Static Planning (GOSP) and Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning (SODP), as well as a Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver (ROASP) module.3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REVERIE benchmark, outperforming prior methods by a large margin of 3.09% in terms of the SPL navigation metric and 3.49% on the RGSPL object grounding metric.4. It conducts extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the different components in MiC and shows the benefits of incorporating dynamic scene-aware perception into the planning process.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the March-in-Chat model to enable an agent to interactively talk with an LLM to generate dynamic plans conditioned on visual scene perceptions for the challenging REVERIE task. The strong experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this interactive planning approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a March-in-Chat model to enable REVERIE navigation agents to dynamically generate navigation plans via dialogue with a large language model, using a room-and-object aware scene perceiver and goal-oriented plus scene-oriented planning modules, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the REVERIE benchmark.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of vision-and-language navigation:- This paper focuses specifically on the REVERIE task, which involves navigating to a target object using only high-level, concise instructions. Many other VLN papers tackle tasks like R2R and RxR that provide more detailed step-by-step instructions. So this work is novel in developing methods tailored for REVERIE's more challenging setting.- The key idea proposed is to have an agent "talk" to a large language model (LLM) on the fly to generate navigation plans dynamically based on environmental observations. This idea of interactive prompting with an LLM planner is quite new and hasn't been explored much for VLN tasks before. - The paper introduces several novel components like the Goal-Oriented Static Planning module, Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning module, and Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver. These contribute to the interactive prompting idea and help the agent leverage the LLM's knowledge.- The proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results on the REVERIE benchmark, outperforming prior work by a large margin of 3-4% on the main metrics. This demonstrates the benefits of the interactive LLM prompting approach.- Compared to some concurrent works that also use LLMs for planning but mainly on simpler environments/tasks, this paper tackles the more complex REVERIE setting with larger spaces and more diverse scenes and objects.- The ablation studies provide useful insights on the contributions of different components. The qualitative analysis also helps understand the model's behavior.Overall, the interactive prompting of an LLM planner based on environmental awareness is an interesting idea for VLN that this paper explores well. The strong results on REVERIE highlight the promise of this approach compared to prior work. The comparisons show the paper makes solid contributions to advancing research on this challenging task.
