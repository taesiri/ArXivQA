# March in Chat: Interactive Prompting for Remote Embodied Referring
  Expression

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we enable an agent to successfully navigate and ground objects in the Remote Embodied Referring Expression (REVERIE) environment using only high-level, concise instructions, by leveraging large language models?The key points are:- REVERIE requires navigation and object grounding using only high-level instructions like "Empty the washing machine on level one", which is challenging. - Existing methods designed for detailed step-by-step instructions do not perform well on REVERIE.- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for action planning in embodied tasks when provided suitable prompts. - But using LLMs to plan for complex REVERIE environments with diverse rooms/objects is still an open problem.- This paper proposes a new model called March-in-Chat (MiC) that allows the agent to interactively query the LLM to generate plans tailored to the current environment.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by enabling dynamic interaction between the agent and LLM, the LLM's knowledge can be leveraged to successfully navigate in REVERIE environments given only high-level instructions. The proposed MiC model aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel March-in-Chat (MiC) model, which lets the REVERIE agent talk with a Large Language Model (LLM) on the fly to make plans for navigating the next few steps. 2. It introduces two planning modules - Goal-Oriented Static Planning (GOSP) and Scene-Oriented Dynamic Planning (SODP), as well as a Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver (ROASP) module.3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REVERIE benchmark, outperforming prior methods by a large margin of 3.09% in terms of the SPL navigation metric and 3.49% on the RGSPL object grounding metric.4. It conducts extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the different components in MiC and shows the benefits of incorporating dynamic scene-aware perception into the planning process.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the March-in-Chat model to enable an agent to interactively talk with an LLM to generate dynamic plans conditioned on visual scene perceptions for the challenging REVERIE task. The strong experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this interactive planning approach.
