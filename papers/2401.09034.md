# [UOEP: User-Oriented Exploration Policy for Enhancing Long-Term User   Experiences in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09034)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have shown promise for improving long-term user engagement in recommender systems. However, modeling the intricate user behavior patterns across tens of millions of items is challenging. In particular, users exhibit varying activity levels, requiring customized exploration strategies. Existing RL-based recommenders often overlook this aspect and apply uniform exploration to all users, hurting long-term user experiences.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel approach called User-Oriented Exploration Policy (UOEP) to enable fine-grained exploration tailored to user groups. The key ideas are:

1) Learn a distributional critic that models the return distribution under different quantiles, capturing varying user activity levels. 

2) Optimize a population of actors, where each actor specializes in a user group under a specific quantile. This allows customizing exploration intensity across user groups.

3) Introduce a population diversity regularization and a supervision module to balance diversity and stability during actor learning.

Main Contributions:
- A new perspective of modeling user groups based on return distribution quantiles in RL-based recommenders.

- A novel user-oriented exploration approach with a distributional critic and a population of actors catering to different user groups.

- Comprehensive experiments demonstrating superior long-term performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

- Analysis showing benefits like better serving low-activity users and improving fairness.

In summary, the paper makes significant strides in accounting for heterogeneous user behaviors during exploration in RL recommenders. The proposed UOEP method achieves more effective and fine-grained exploration leading to enhanced long-term user experiences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a user-oriented exploration policy called UOEP for recommender systems that learns different policies targeting user groups of varying activity levels, using a distributional critic to capture return distributions and conditional value at risk to enable fine-grained exploration optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel reinforcement learning-based recommendation approach called UOEP (User-Oriented Exploration Policy) that facilitates fine-grained exploration among user groups with varying activity levels. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) It constructs a distributional critic to capture the return distribution under different quantiles, representing varying activity levels of user groups. 

2) It devises a population of distinct actors, with each actor optimized towards a specific quantile level using the conditional value at risk (CVaR) measure. This allows customizing exploration intensity for different user groups.

3) It introduces a population diversity regularization and a supervision module to enhance diversity and stability during the exploration process.

4) Comprehensive experiments demonstrate UOEP's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of long-term performance. Further analysis also reveals its benefits in serving low-activity users and improving fairness.

In summary, the core innovation lies in enabling user-oriented and fine-grained exploration in reinforcement learning-based recommender systems to better cater to users with varying activity patterns. This is achieved through a novel model architecture and training strategy.
