# [A SAM-guided Two-stream Lightweight Model for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In industrial anomaly detection, model efficiency and mobile-friendliness are critical for real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on complex memory banks or distillation frameworks, suffering from high computational costs. Meanwhile, foundation models like SAM exhibit impressive generalization capabilities but contain too many parameters. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a SAM-guided Two-stream Lightweight Model (STLM) for unsupervised anomaly detection, which meets the model efficiency and mobile-friendly requirements while leveraging SAM's generalization ability. 

The framework consists of:
1) A fixed SAM teacher which provides knowledge distillation
2) A trainable Two-stream Lightweight Model (TLM) with a plain student stream to generate discriminative features and a denoising student stream to reconstruct normal features. This enhances differentiation when facing anomalies. 
3) A lightweight Feature Aggregation (FA) module to generate anomaly maps.

Pseudo anomalies are introduced into the training data. TLM distills distinct knowledge from SAM. One TLM stream sees original images while the other sees images with pseudo anomalies. This further separates their feature representations on anomalies.  

Contributions:
1) Proposes a SAM-guided framework to meet model efficiency/mobile-friendly requirements while utilizing SAM's generalization for anomaly detection
2) Designs a two-stream model to distill knowledge from SAM and enhance feature differentiation on anomalies
3) Achieves competitive results on MVTec and VisA benchmarks with only 16M parameters and inference time within 20ms, demonstrating effectiveness and model efficiency.

The framework aligns well with industrial application demands, showing promising capability as an efficient and mobile-friendly solution while harnessing generalization abilities of foundation models.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a SAM-guided Two-stream Lightweight Model (STLM) for unsupervised anomaly detection that meets the demands of model efficiency and mobile-friendliness in real-world industrial applications, while also harnessing the strong generalization ability of the SAM foundation model. 

2. The STLM effectively distills distinct knowledge from SAM into a lightweight Two-stream Model (TLM), with one stream focused on generating discriminative and generalized features in both normal and anomalous regions, and the other stream reconstructing features without anomalies.

3. It employs a shared lightweight mask decoder and feature aggregation module to generate anomaly maps while significantly reducing parameters and improving inference speed.

4. Experiments on MVTec AD, VisA and DAGM datasets demonstrate that the proposed STLM achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while being much more efficient in terms of model size and inference time.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel SAM-guided lightweight framework for efficient unsupervised anomaly detection that meets real-world application requirements without sacrificing detection accuracy.
