# [Two-stage optimized unified adversarial patch for attacking   visible-infrared cross-modal detectors in the physical world](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01789)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a Two-stage Optimized Unified Adversarial Patch (TOUAP) to perform physical attacks against visible-infrared cross-modal vehicle detectors. The method uses a two-stage optimization strategy to separately optimize an infrared patch and a visible patch using particle swarm optimization. The infrared patch is modeled as an irregular octagon polygon constrained within a nine-palace grid to maximize adversarial impact. The visible patch is modeled as a color QR code using the shape of the infrared patch as a mask. Experiments demonstrate TOUAP's effectiveness in attacking detectors digitally and physically, achieving over 80% attack success rate. The method exhibits robustness by successfully attacking five advanced detectors and outperforming baseline methods. TOUAP is easy to deploy at low cost using printed posters and cold patches. The authors advocate for increased attention to this attack method given its demonstrated effectiveness and robustness in the physical cross-modal attack setting. Defenses such as adversarial training and image inpainting can reduce but not eliminate TOUAP's impact.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
While there has been extensive research on adversarial attacks against visible light or infrared detectors independently, there is a lack of comprehensive security analysis for cross-modal detectors that utilize both modalities. Cross-modal detectors are more reliable for tasks like autonomous driving and pedestrian detection. Existing works have shown the feasibility of attacks against cross-modal detectors but lack robustness. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a Two-stage Optimized Unified Adversarial Patch (TOUAP) to perform robust physical attacks against visible-infrared cross-modal vehicle detectors in black-box settings. 

1) A two-stage optimization process is used. First, particle swarm optimization optimizes an irregular polygonal infrared patch. Second, a color QR code is optimized and combined with the infrared patch shape as a mask to get an irregular polygon visible patch.

2) A nine-palace grid is used to constrain the vertices of the irregular polygon to maximize adversarial impact. 

3) Expectation over Transformation is used to enhance robustness against variations between digital and physical domains.

4) Experiments show TOUAP achieves 98.17% attack success rate digitally and 87.5% physically against cross-modal YOLOv3 detector. It also surpasses baseline methods like UnfAP and HCB.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of a two-stage optimized unified adversarial patch (TOUAP) for robust physical attacks against visible-infrared cross-modal vehicle detectors in black-box settings.

2) Novel use of nine-palace grid to constrain patch shape and maximize adversarial impact.

3) Demonstration of high attack success rates digitally (98.17%) and physically (87.5%) against cross-modal YOLOv3 detector, outperforming baselines.

4) Confirmation of TOUAP's effectiveness against 5 advanced cross-modal detectors, proving its robustness. 

5) Easy and inexpensive deployment using printed posters and cold patches, presenting a realistic threat.
