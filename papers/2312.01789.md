# [Two-stage optimized unified adversarial patch for attacking   visible-infrared cross-modal detectors in the physical world](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01789)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a Two-stage Optimized Unified Adversarial Patch (TOUAP) to perform physical attacks against visible-infrared cross-modal vehicle detectors. The method uses a two-stage optimization strategy to separately optimize an infrared patch and a visible patch using particle swarm optimization. The infrared patch is modeled as an irregular octagon polygon constrained within a nine-palace grid to maximize adversarial impact. The visible patch is modeled as a color QR code using the shape of the infrared patch as a mask. Experiments demonstrate TOUAP's effectiveness in attacking detectors digitally and physically, achieving over 80% attack success rate. The method exhibits robustness by successfully attacking five advanced detectors and outperforming baseline methods. TOUAP is easy to deploy at low cost using printed posters and cold patches. The authors advocate for increased attention to this attack method given its demonstrated effectiveness and robustness in the physical cross-modal attack setting. Defenses such as adversarial training and image inpainting can reduce but not eliminate TOUAP's impact.
