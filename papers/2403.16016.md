# [Fill in the ____ (a Diffusion-based Image Inpainting Pipeline)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16016)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image inpainting involves filling in lost or occluded parts of an image. It has many applications like restoring damaged images or removing unwanted objects.
- Existing inpainting models can generate sensible image completions but lack control over what gets generated in the filled region.
- The paper aims to enhance existing diffusion-based inpainting (like RePaint) to allow guiding the filled region using a target image while maintaining quality. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper builds on RePaint, a diffusion-based inpainting method that leverages a pre-trained denoising diffusion model. 
- A core pipeline is proposed that takes a scene, target image, and mask as inputs. It performs forward and backward diffusion on both scene and target.  
- During backward passes, a convex combination resolves "mask conflicts" between diffused and denoised versions of target.
- Refinements like heated masks, scene buffers, and lambda scheduling further enhance realism and control.

Key Contributions:
- A novel guided inpainting pipeline building on RePaint that allows specifying a target image.
- Techniques like lambda scheduling, heated masks and scene buffers to improve boundary realism. 
- Analysis of the impact of key hyperparameters on resulting image quality.
- Promising qualitative results showing the method can plausibly integrate target objects into scenes.

In summary, the paper presents a pipeline to guide diffusion-based inpainting using target images as prompts while preserving output quality. The analysis provides insights into hyperparameters and extensions for improving boundary realism.
