# [MILES: Visual BERT Pre-training with Injected Language Semantics for   Video-text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12408)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to incorporate masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training with dual-encoder architectures to enable efficient video-text retrieval while enhancing fine-grained video context understanding and video-text local semantic alignment. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Imposing masked visual modeling regularization with reconstruction targets that are aligned with language semantics can promote the learning of fine-grained video features and cross-modality alignment in video-text pre-training.

2) Using a snapshot video encoder to provide text-aligned masked visual modeling targets allows injecting language semantics into local video representations without requiring extra pre-training stages.

3) Masked visual modeling with language-aligned targets in dual-encoder video-text pre-training improves downstream retrieval performance by enhancing both visual context understanding and cross-modality alignment at the local level.

So in summary, the central research question is how to effectively incorporate masked visual modeling into dual-encoder video-text pre-training in a way that improves local alignment and fine-grained feature learning. The key hypotheses focus on using a snapshot encoder to provide aligned masked modeling targets without extra pre-training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It explores masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training with dual-encoder architectures for efficient video-text retrieval. Previous works have used dual-encoders for retrieval efficiency but they ignore local semantics. This work shows how masked visual modeling can help learn better local visual semantics and alignment in dual-encoder models.

2. It proposes an effective method to generate reconstruction targets for the masked visual modeling using a snapshot video encoder. The snapshot encoder evolves to produce targets with injected language semantics without needing extra pre-training stages. 

3. It demonstrates strong empirical results on text-to-video retrieval and zero-shot action recognition tasks, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. The results validate the benefits of masked visual modeling for learning better video representations in dual-encoder models.

In summary, the key contribution is exploring and effectively utilizing masked visual modeling in dual-encoder video-text pre-training to get benefits of local alignment while maintaining retrieval efficiency. The proposed method of using a snapshot encoder for reconstruction targets is shown to work well empirically.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called MILES for video-text pre-training using masked visual modeling with a snapshot video encoder to inject language semantics into the reconstruction targets, achieving state-of-the-art results on text-to-video retrieval and zero-shot action recognition tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents several novel contributions to video-text pre-training for video retrieval tasks:

- It explores masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training, adapting techniques like BERT and BEIT from NLP and image domains to the video domain. Most prior work has focused on contrastive learning between global video/text representations. Masked modeling encourages learning of fine-grained local semantics.

- It proposes a method to generate reconstruction targets for masked visual modeling without needing extra pre-training stages. It uses a "snapshot" video encoder that evolves via exponential moving average of the main encoder to produce targets aligned with language semantics.

- It maintains an efficient dual-encoder architecture (separate video and text encoders). Many recent methods use slower joint encoders. 

- It shows superior results on text-to-video retrieval benchmarks like MSR-VTT, outperforming prior arts like Frozen, ClipBERT, etc. It also shows strong performance on zero-shot action recognition.

- It provides useful ablation studies analyzing reconstruction targets, masking strategies, snapshot encoder update mechanisms, etc. This gives good insights into what factors contribute to the gains.

Compared to prior arts, this paper makes good progress in adapting powerful techniques from NLP/image domains to further improve video-text pre-training and retrieval. The proposed method of generating reconstruction targets is creative. Maintaining efficiency is also a plus over joint encoder methods. The empirical gains over strong baselines demonstrate the efficacy of the techniques proposed.
