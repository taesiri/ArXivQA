# [MILES: Visual BERT Pre-training with Injected Language Semantics for   Video-text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12408)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to incorporate masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training with dual-encoder architectures to enable efficient video-text retrieval while enhancing fine-grained video context understanding and video-text local semantic alignment. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Imposing masked visual modeling regularization with reconstruction targets that are aligned with language semantics can promote the learning of fine-grained video features and cross-modality alignment in video-text pre-training.

2) Using a snapshot video encoder to provide text-aligned masked visual modeling targets allows injecting language semantics into local video representations without requiring extra pre-training stages.

3) Masked visual modeling with language-aligned targets in dual-encoder video-text pre-training improves downstream retrieval performance by enhancing both visual context understanding and cross-modality alignment at the local level.

So in summary, the central research question is how to effectively incorporate masked visual modeling into dual-encoder video-text pre-training in a way that improves local alignment and fine-grained feature learning. The key hypotheses focus on using a snapshot encoder to provide aligned masked modeling targets without extra pre-training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It explores masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training with dual-encoder architectures for efficient video-text retrieval. Previous works have used dual-encoders for retrieval efficiency but they ignore local semantics. This work shows how masked visual modeling can help learn better local visual semantics and alignment in dual-encoder models.

2. It proposes an effective method to generate reconstruction targets for the masked visual modeling using a snapshot video encoder. The snapshot encoder evolves to produce targets with injected language semantics without needing extra pre-training stages. 

3. It demonstrates strong empirical results on text-to-video retrieval and zero-shot action recognition tasks, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. The results validate the benefits of masked visual modeling for learning better video representations in dual-encoder models.

In summary, the key contribution is exploring and effectively utilizing masked visual modeling in dual-encoder video-text pre-training to get benefits of local alignment while maintaining retrieval efficiency. The proposed method of using a snapshot encoder for reconstruction targets is shown to work well empirically.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called MILES for video-text pre-training using masked visual modeling with a snapshot video encoder to inject language semantics into the reconstruction targets, achieving state-of-the-art results on text-to-video retrieval and zero-shot action recognition tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents several novel contributions to video-text pre-training for video retrieval tasks:

- It explores masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training, adapting techniques like BERT and BEIT from NLP and image domains to the video domain. Most prior work has focused on contrastive learning between global video/text representations. Masked modeling encourages learning of fine-grained local semantics.

- It proposes a method to generate reconstruction targets for masked visual modeling without needing extra pre-training stages. It uses a "snapshot" video encoder that evolves via exponential moving average of the main encoder to produce targets aligned with language semantics.

- It maintains an efficient dual-encoder architecture (separate video and text encoders). Many recent methods use slower joint encoders. 

- It shows superior results on text-to-video retrieval benchmarks like MSR-VTT, outperforming prior arts like Frozen, ClipBERT, etc. It also shows strong performance on zero-shot action recognition.

- It provides useful ablation studies analyzing reconstruction targets, masking strategies, snapshot encoder update mechanisms, etc. This gives good insights into what factors contribute to the gains.

Compared to prior arts, this paper makes good progress in adapting powerful techniques from NLP/image domains to further improve video-text pre-training and retrieval. The proposed method of generating reconstruction targets is creative. Maintaining efficiency is also a plus over joint encoder methods. The empirical gains over strong baselines demonstrate the efficacy of the techniques proposed.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other pre-training objectives and architectures for video-text retrieval. The authors propose masked visual modeling as a promising pre-training technique, but suggest there is room for innovation in designing other pretext tasks and model architectures tailored for video-text retrieval. 

- Improving masked visual modeling for video-text pre-training. The authors point out several components of their proposed masked visual modeling approach that could be further improved, such as the masking strategy, reconstruction targets, and updating mechanism for the snapshot encoder.

- Applying the idea of masked visual modeling to other video-language tasks beyond retrieval. The authors suggest the potential of using techniques like masked visual modeling for other cross-modal video-language understanding tasks besides retrieval.

- Extending masked visual modeling to multi-modal pre-training. The paper focuses on video and text, but notes masked visual modeling could be useful for pre-training with other modalities like audio.

- Scaling up pre-training with larger datasets. The authors use relatively small pre-training datasets compared to other work, and suggest scaling up pre-training as a direction for further boosting performance.

- Reducing the computational costs. The authors note the computational overhead of techniques like masked visual modeling, and suggest reducing costs through methods like distillation as an important direction.

- Evaluating on a wider range of downstream tasks. The authors focus evaluation on retrieval and action recognition, but suggest assessing the transfer learning abilities to other downstream tasks as well.

In summary, the main future directions revolve around improving and extending masked visual modeling, and more broadly exploring innovative pre-training techniques tailored for video-language representation learning. Evaluating these techniques on a diverse set of benchmarks is emphasized as an important direction too.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper explores masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training with the goal of improving video-text retrieval. It proposes a new method called MILES (Masked visual modeling with Injected LanguagE Semantics) that uses an extra snapshot video encoder to provide reconstruction targets for masked patches in the input video. During pre-training, some video patches are masked and the in-training video encoder tries to reconstruct the features of the masked patches using the visible patches and temporal context. The targets for reconstruction come from the snapshot encoder which evolves to produce features aligned with language semantics. This forces the main video encoder to reconstruct patches in a way that captures fine-grained semantics aligned with the text. Experiments on text-to-video retrieval and action recognition tasks show MILES outperforms recent methods by a large margin. The key ideas are using a self-trained snapshot encoder to provide semantic targets for masked reconstruction and enforcing reasoning over spatial and temporal context, which improves local feature discriminativeness and cross-modality alignment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores masked visual modeling in video-text pre-training with a "dual-encoder" architecture for efficient video-text retrieval. The authors propose using an extra snapshot video encoder to provide reconstruction targets with injected language semantics for masked visual modeling (MVM). Specifically, they mask a proportion of video patches in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The masked video is fed into the main video encoder to predict features of the masked patches. Meanwhile, the raw video is fed into the snapshot encoder to produce reconstruction targets that are aligned with language semantics. The snapshot encoder is updated from the main encoder under global video-text contrastive learning. Imposing MVM towards the snapshot encoder's output trains the main encoder to recover text-aligned features of masked patches by reasoning among visible regions. This enhances both fine-grained visual understanding and cross-modality alignment.

The method is evaluated on text-to-video retrieval and action recognition. It significantly outperforms recent methods on four text-to-video retrieval benchmarks under both zero-shot and fine-tuning protocols. It also achieves strong results on zero-shot action recognition, formulated as video-to-text retrieval. Additional benefits include competitive action recognition with less pre-training data. The visualizations demonstrate the model's improved focus on salient visual regions and fine-grained text-video alignment. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of using a snapshot encoder for MVM and the design choices like masking strategy. The work successfully explores the potential of BERT-style pre-training for video-text retrieval using dual encoders.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper explores masked visual modeling (MVM) in video-text pre-training with a "dual-encoder" architecture for efficient video-text retrieval. The key contribution is using an extra snapshot video encoder to provide reconstruction targets for the MVM pretext task. Specifically, they randomly mask patches of input videos in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The masked video is fed into the main video encoder to predict features of the masked patches. Meanwhile, the raw video is fed into the snapshot encoder to produce text-aligned reconstruction targets for the masked patches. The snapshot encoder is updated from the main encoder using momentum, such that its outputs gradually align with language semantics over training. By forcing the main encoder to reconstruct the snapshot encoder's text-aligned features for masked patches, it learns to produce local video features that are better aligned with language. This improves fine-grained video-text alignment while retaining a dual-encoder structure for efficient retrieval during inference. Experiments show superiority over state-of-the-art methods on text-to-video retrieval and zero-shot action recognition benchmarks.

This paper proposes a new method called MILES for visual BERT pre-training with injected language semantics for video-text retrieval. The authors adopt a dual-encoder architecture with separate video and text encoders for efficient retrieval. To enhance learning of fine-grained semantics, they introduce masked visual modeling (MVM) where a proportion of video patches are masked and predicted based on context.
