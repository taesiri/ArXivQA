# [Large Foundation Models for Power Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07044)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the emerging opportunities and challenges of applying large foundation models such as LLMs to power system tasks. The authors first validate the performance of existing foundation models on representative power system problems including optimal power flow, EV scheduling, knowledge retrieval from technical reports, and situation awareness. They find these models can effectively solve constrained optimization problems, serve as intermediaries between users and algorithms, retrieve knowledge from documents, and fuse multimodal inputs for monitoring. However, limitations exist regarding computational expense, reliance on templates/datasets, answer consistency, and integrating diverse data sources. The paper outlines potential solutions like improved initialization and prompts, expanding function libraries, ensemble learning, fine-tuning, and leveraging complementary modalities. Overall, the paper demonstrates noteworthy capabilities of foundation models to enhance efficiency and reliability of power system operations, while highlighting areas needing advancement before full-scale deployment. Key tasks suited for these models include optimization, end-user interfaces, knowledge management, anomaly detection, forecasting, and decision support.
