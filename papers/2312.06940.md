# [Benchmarking Deep Learning Classifiers for SAR Automatic Target   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06940)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper benchmarks several deep learning models on SAR automatic target recognition (ATR) tasks using three distinct SAR image datasets - MSTAR, GBSAR, and SynthWakeSAR. The models evaluated are Residual Neural Networks (ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Vision Transformers (SS-ViT). The metrics used for comparison are classification accuracy, inference throughput, model parameters and size, MAC operations, and number of layers. The results show trade-offs between metrics for each model and dataset, with no single best model emerging. For example, GNN has the fastest inference and fewest operations, while SS-ViT has the smallest model size. ResNet achieves higher accuracy on GBSAR and SynthWakeSAR. The authors conclude that model selection requires analysis of the specific application constraints, datasets properties, and desired trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and model complexity. More public SAR datasets with varying capture parameters are needed to further improve robustness. Overall, this comprehensive benchmarking provides useful insights for practitioners aiming to deploy deep learning for SAR ATR systems.
