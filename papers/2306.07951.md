# [Questioning the Survey Responses of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07951)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

Do the aggregate responses of large language models to survey questions resemble those of human populations?

The authors systematically investigate whether the probability distributions over survey question responses generated by large language models reflect meaningful patterns and statistics like those found when surveying real human populations.

To summarize, the key question is whether language models produce survey response distributions that actually resemble a human population, or if their responses lack critical signals and interdependencies that would be present in human survey data. The paper provides empirical evidence for the latter.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an empirical investigation of what we can learn from large language models' survey responses. The authors systematically survey over a dozen language models of varying sizes on 25 questions from the American Community Survey (ACS). They make two key observations:

1. After adjusting for labeling bias, the distributions over survey responses from language models are predominantly uniform, irrespective of model size or question asked. This distribution differs significantly from the U.S. census population. 

2. When language models are prompted to fill out entire questionnaires sequentially, the generated data lacks the statistical patterns present in real ACS survey data. Models' answers to one question cannot help predict answers to other questions, unlike in human survey data. 

Overall, the paper provides evidence that the aggregate statistics of language models' survey responses presently lack meaningful signals and do not resemble those of human populations. This cautions the use of surveys on language models as a substitute for surveying real people. The robust analysis and proposed techniques in this paper help reveal the limitations of interpreting survey responses from large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper systematically shows that the aggregate survey responses of large language models do not resemble those of any human population, exhibiting instead a bias towards uniform randomness devoid of meaningful statistical patterns.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- Focus on probing survey responses of language models: This paper specifically looks at evaluating aggregate statistics over survey responses generated by language models. A lot of prior work has focused more on evaluating language models' capabilities for question answering. This paper emphasizes that producing useful responses to specific questions is different from generating meaningful aggregate survey statistics.

- Systematic large-scale evaluation: The authors evaluate a wide range of language models, from a few hundred million to 10 billion parameters, prompting each hundreds of thousands of times on a standardized survey questionnaire. Other work has tended to study fewer models and fewer response samples. The large-scale evaluation allows robust quantification of trends. 

- Investigation of labeling bias: A key contribution is the analysis of "A-bias", the tendency of smaller models to favor the first answer choice. The authors propose methods to quantify and adjust for this bias. Most prior work has not investigated the effects of answer ordering.

- Absence of aggregate statistical signal: Through prediction tasks and other analyses, the paper provides evidence that language models lack the statistical patterns found in real human survey data. This is a novel result not shown in previous studies.

- Cautionary findings: The overall conclusion cautions against interpreting language models' survey responses as reflective of human populations. This contrasts with some other work exploring potential benefits of using language models for surveys and polling.

So in summary, this paper provides a large-scale, rigorous evaluation methodology and empirical evidence that language models currently lack critical capabilities for generating meaningful aggregate survey statistics. The findings serve as an important benchmark for future progress in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating how the findings transfer to other surveys beyond the American Community Survey, as well as to ever more capable language models. The authors suggest examining different types of surveys with different topics and question formats. 

- Developing better techniques for mitigating the labeling bias (e.g. A-bias) exhibited by language models when answering survey questions. The authors highlight the need for methods that allow models to focus more on the semantic content rather than spurious signals.

- Exploring different prompting approaches when surveying language models that could potentially elicit responses more similar to human populations. The authors suggest this is an important direction for using language models as participants in social science research.

- Applying the analysis techniques introduced in this work, such as measuring entropy, choice randomization, and the signal test, to further probe and evaluate language models' survey responses. The authors propose these as valuable tools for questioning model responses.

- Investigating whether the observed limitations persist as language models continue to increase in scale and capability. The authors suggest continuing to monitor model survey responses through a rigorous methodology.

In summary, the main suggestions involve 1) evaluating a broader range of surveys and models, 2) developing techniques to reduce bias, 3) exploring different prompting approaches, 4) utilizing the analysis techniques introduced in this work, and 5) tracking whether the limitations persist over time. The overall goal is to work towards eliciting more human-like survey responses from language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper examines what can be learned from language models' responses to survey questions based on the American Community Survey. The authors evaluate over a dozen language models varying in size and find two main results. First, smaller models exhibit significant bias towards earlier answer choices, especially "A", but this diminishes slowly with model size. Second, after adjusting for this bias, models' aggregate survey responses do not match U.S. census statistics or any cognizable population, but instead trend towards uniform randomness. The paper concludes that aggregate statistics from language models currently lack the signals found in human survey responses, cautioning against treating model surveys as equivalent to human surveys.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper examines what can be learned from large language models' responses to survey questions, using the American Community Survey (ACS) as a case study. The authors evaluate over a dozen models ranging in size on 25 questions from the ACS, sampling each model hundreds of thousands of times. They find two main results:

First, smaller models exhibit significant position and labeling bias, preferring survey responses labeled earlier in the sequence (especially "A"). This bias diminishes slowly with model size. After adjusting for this by randomizing answer order, models' responses trend close to uniform across questions, irrespective of model size. 

Second, when prompting models with the full ACS questionnaire sequentially, their responses lack the population-level correlations found in real ACS data. The authors test this via a "signal test," training classifiers to predict income from other survey answers. Classifiers perform no better than a constant baseline on model-generated data, whereas real ACS data shows clear predictive signal. 

Overall, the paper cautions that current language models do not produce aggregate survey statistics resembling those from human populations. Their responses exhibit bias absent in humans and fail to capture multivariate relationships between questions that provide population insights. More work is needed before treating language models as survey respondents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper examines what can be learned from a language model's survey responses to questions from the American Community Survey (ACS) by the U.S. Census Bureau. The authors evaluate over a dozen different language models, varying in size from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of parameters, by prompting them with 25 multiple choice questions from the ACS hundreds of thousands of times each. The distributions over survey responses from the models are compared to census data to systematically analyze two dominant patterns. First, smaller models exhibit a significant bias towards earlier answer choices, especially "A", but this diminishes slowly as model size increases. Second, after adjusting for this labeling bias, models trend toward uniform aggregate statistics over survey responses, rather than those of any cognizable population, even when varying the prompting style. The authors conclude that aggregate statistics from surveying language models presently lack the signals found in human populations, cautioning the use of such survey responses.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem/question addressed in this paper are:

- The paper is examining what we can learn from surveying large language models (LLMs) with questions from the American Community Survey (ACS) by the U.S. Census Bureau. 

- It aims to investigate two main questions: 1) How similar are the distributions over individual survey responses of LLMs to those of the US census population? 2) Does the data generated by sequentially prompting LLMs with survey questions contain the statistical patterns found in the ACS census data?

- More broadly, the paper is questioning whether the aggregate responses of LLMs to survey questions actually resemble those of human populations, which is an important consideration as LLMs are increasingly used to conduct surveys.  

- The motivation is that while LLMs are good at question answering, surveys have a different goal of eliciting aggregate statistics over responses that faithfully represent a reference population. It's unclear if LLM survey responses will achieve this.

So in summary, the key problem is assessing whether LLM survey responses exhibit distributions and statistical patterns comparable to human survey responses, in order to understand what we can actually learn from surveying LLMs. The paper empirically investigates this through systematic experiments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes surveying language models using questions from the American Community Survey (ACS). What were the key considerations in selecting the ACS as the basis for the survey questions? How might using a different survey like the General Social Survey impact the analysis and results?

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper examines the survey responses of large language models on the basis of the American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Census Bureau. The authors prompt 40 language models of varying sizes with 25 multiple choice questions from the 2019 ACS, both individually and sequentially in full questionnaires. They find two dominant patterns in the models' responses. First, models have substantial position and labeling biases, strongly tending to select choices labeled "A". After adjusting for these biases, models across the board trend towards uniform random responses. Second, datasets generated by sequentially filling ACS questionnaires can be nearly perfectly discriminated from real census data using binary classifiers. Overall, the findings suggest caution in treating survey responses from language models as equivalent to those from human populations currently. The authors discuss implications for using opinion surveys to quantify alignment of models with groups and for employing models to emulate survey responses in social sciences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the survey responses of large language models using questions from the American Community Survey, finding that models exhibit significant biases and their responses predominantly trend towards being uniformly random rather than resembling those of human populations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper examines the survey responses of large language models using questions from the American Community Survey. The authors systematically evaluate numerous language models, finding they exhibit significant position and labeling biases towards picking certain answers. After adjusting for these biases, models' responses trend strongly towards uniform randomness across questions, rather than resembling census responses. The authors also generate synthetic survey datasets by sequentially prompting models to answer questionnaires, and show classifiers can easily discriminate these from real census data. Overall, the findings suggest caution in treating language models' survey responses as human-like, with implications for using opinion surveys to study model alignment or using models to emulate human survey responses.
