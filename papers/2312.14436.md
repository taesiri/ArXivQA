# [REBEL: A Regularization-Based Solution for Reward Overoptimization in   Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics relies on carefully designing reward functions that align with the intended behavior. However, in practice, reward functions often end up misaligned due to reward hacking, leading to failures. The paper argues that human preferences provide a way to learn improved reward functions but existing preference-based RL methods face issues like reward over-optimization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework called REBEL (Reward Regularization Based Robotic Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) that introduces a new regularization term called "agent preference". This is the value function at the optimal policy and acts as a proxy for the RL agent's preferences. The intuition is that along with human preferences, the agent's preferences should also be accounted for when learning the reward function.

The REBEL objective function has two terms - a human preference term based on trajectory rankings from humans, and the proposed agent preference regularization term. The relative importance is controlled by a hyperparameters lambda. This regularization helps prevent over-optimization.


Main Contributions:

- Concept of agent preference as a novel regularization method for reward learning in preference-based RL

- Proposed REBEL algorithm that utilizes this regularization when learning rewards from human feedback 

- Experiments on DM Control Suite continuous tasks showing REBEL is more sample-efficient - it achieves upto 70% better episodic returns compared to prior state-of-the-art methods like PEBBLE.

- Analysis of impact of amount of human feedback and effect of regularization weight lambda on performance.

In summary, the paper addresses an important issue of over-optimization in reward learning for robotics via a simple yet effective regularization approach. REBEL outperforms prior preference-based RL algorithms on a standard benchmark.
