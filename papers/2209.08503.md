# [Revisiting Rolling Shutter Bundle Adjustment: Toward Accurate and Fast   Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08503)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an accurate and efficient bundle adjustment solution for unordered rolling shutter images without restrictive assumptions on camera motions or image capture manner. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Normalizing the image measurements can improve the accuracy of rolling shutter bundle adjustment by providing a more symmetric error distribution for the optimizer. 

2. Modelling and weighting the reprojection errors based on their covariance can further improve accuracy and avoid degenerate solutions.

3. Exploiting the sparsity in the Jacobian matrix can significantly accelerate the optimization process.

The authors propose a new normalized weighted rolling shutter bundle adjustment method (NW-RSBA) that incorporates these ideas. They demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and real data that NW-RSBA achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to prior RSBA methods. The main contribution is providing an accurate, efficient, and general RSBA solution that can be easily integrated into existing 3D reconstruction pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. They investigate the influence of image point normalization on RSBA performance and show its advantages. 

2. They present an analytical model for the visual residual covariance, which helps standardize the reprojection error during RSBA and improve overall accuracy.

3. They propose a normalized weighted RSBA (NW-RSBA) which combines normalization and covariance weighting. NW-RSBA can avoid common planar degeneracy without constraining the camera capture manner.

4. They propose an acceleration strategy for NW-RSBA based on sparsity of the Jacobian matrix and a two-stage Schur complement approach. 

5. They show NW-RSBA can be easily implemented and plugged into existing SfM/SLAM pipelines to handle rolling shutter cameras. 

6. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, they demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of NW-RSBA over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and speed.

In summary, the key contribution is an accurate, efficient, and robust RSBA solution that can be easily integrated into existing 3D vision systems to enable rolling shutter support. The normalization, weighting, acceleration strategies, and extensive validations are the main novelties presented.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an accurate and efficient bundle adjustment solution for unordered rolling shutter image sets that handles planar degeneracy by normalizing image measurements and weighting the reprojection errors based on a covariance model, and accelerates the optimization using a two-stage Schur complement on the sparse Jacobian.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on rolling shutter bundle adjustment (RSBA):

- Inputs - Many existing RSBA methods rely on video sequences as input, while this paper focuses on handling unordered image sets which are more common in structure from motion pipelines. 

- Motion assumptions - Some prior works make assumptions on the camera motion, like constant velocity or acceleration. This paper does not make restrictive motion assumptions.

- Degeneracy handling - The paper shows their proposed normalized weighted RSBA (NW-RSBA) avoids the planar degeneracy issue that can affect other RSBA techniques, without needing constrained capture.

- Accuracy - Experiments demonstrate NW-RSBA provides more accurate camera pose and 3D reconstruction than state-of-the-art RSBA methods.

- Efficiency - The paper proposes techniques to accelerate NW-RSBA, achieving 10x speedup over existing general RSBA solutions. 

- Applicability - NW-RSBA is formulated as a module that can easily be integrated into existing SfM/SLAM systems to handle rolling shutter, with demonstrations on VisualSFM and OrbSLAM.

Overall, a key contribution is providing an RSBA solution that is more general, effective, and efficient compared to prior works. The experiments verify improved accuracy and efficiency of the proposed techniques on both synthetic and real datasets. The modular design also makes adoption easier to upgrade global shutter pipelines.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more general RSBA methods that can handle unordered image sets as input, without restrictive assumptions on camera motion or imaging manner. The authors argue existing video-based and direct RSBA methods have limitations in terms of inputs and motion modeling that restrict their applicability.

- Designing more effective RSBA algorithms that can avoid degenerate solutions like planar collapse, without needing to constrain the image capture process. The authors suggest handling the planar degeneracy issue through techniques like covariance weighting, without restricting readout directions.

- Improving the efficiency and runtime of RSBA approaches through acceleration strategies. The authors propose a two-stage Schur complement technique to accelerate their RSBA method as an example.

- Further exploring the connections between normalized measurement-based and camera-based RSBA formulations. The authors show an equivalence between normalized direct camera-based RSBA and their proposed normalized weighted RSBA, suggesting more work can be done to understand these relationships.

- Applying insights from RSBA research to build practical RSSfM and RSSLAM systems. The authors demonstrate plugging in their RSBA into existing SfM and SLAM pipelines, but more validation on large datasets and scenes is needed.

- Exploring learning-based alternatives to complement optimization-based RSBA. The authors focus on optimization techniques, but learning could potentially help address some challenges.

In summary, the main future directions pointed out are developing more general, effective and efficient RSBA algorithms, understanding theoretical relationships between formulations, and applying RSBA advances to downstream vision tasks. The authors lay out an extensive research agenda for the RSBA problem.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new bundle adjustment solution for handling rolling shutter cameras. Bundle adjustment is the problem of refining the estimated camera poses and 3D points in a scene by minimizing the reprojection error. Rolling shutter cameras expose each image row sequentially over time rather than all at once like global shutter cameras. This causes distortions in the image known as the rolling shutter effect that need to be modeled in bundle adjustment. 

The paper first shows that normalizing the image measurements improves the accuracy of rolling shutter bundle adjustment compared to using original pixel coordinates. It then presents an analytical model for the visual reprojection error covariance under rolling shutter distortion. Using this model, the errors can be weighted to standardize and normalize them during optimization. The combination of measurement normalization and covariance weighting notably improves both the accuracy and robustness of rolling shutter bundle adjustment on synthetic and real datasets. It avoids problematic degenerate conditions and is over 10x faster than prior techniques by exploiting sparsity in the Jacobian matrix. The method can be easily integrated into existing bundle adjustment pipelines.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a novel bundle adjustment (BA) solution for handling the rolling shutter effect in structure from motion and visual SLAM systems. The key ideas are:

1) They investigate the influence of image normalization on bundle adjustment performance and show it improves accuracy by making the motion approximation errors more symmetric. 

2) They model the covariance of the reprojection errors based on image noise and use it to reweight the squared errors during optimization. This makes the solution more robust to noise and prevents planar degeneracies.

3) They provide an analytical Jacobian for their cost function to enable efficient optimization. 

4) They use a two-stage Schur complement strategy to exploit sparsity and accelerate the solution.

The proposed normalized weighted RSBA (NW-RSBA) combines these ideas into a practical BA solution that can plugin to existing SfM/SLAM systems. Experiments verify it provides more accurate and efficient RS motion estimation without restrictive assumptions on the camera motions or capture.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of bundle adjustment with rolling shutter cameras. Bundle adjustment is the process of refining 3D reconstruction by optimizing camera poses and 3D point coordinates to minimize reprojection error. Rolling shutter cameras complicate this process because the image is captured in a sequential scanline-by-scanline fashion, so the camera pose changes slightly during image capture. 

The key questions/problems addressed in the paper are:

- How to formulate bundle adjustment with a rolling shutter camera model that accounts for the changing pose during image readout?

- How to make bundle adjustment with rolling shutter more robust, accurate and efficient compared to prior work?

- How to avoid degenerate configurations that can cause failure cases in rolling shutter bundle adjustment?

Specifically, the paper presents a new rolling shutter bundle adjustment method called Normalized Weighted RSBA (NW-RSBA) that addresses these issues. It investigates normalization of image measurements and proposes a visual residual covariance weighting technique to improve accuracy. It also presents an acceleration strategy using sparsity in the Jacobian matrix. Experiments demonstrate NW-RSBA is more accurate, efficient and robust compared to prior rolling shutter bundle adjustment techniques.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Rolling shutter (RS) camera: The paper focuses on handling images captured by RS cameras, as opposed to global shutter (GS) cameras. The RS effect causes image distortion due to the line-by-line image readout.

- Bundle adjustment (BA): BA is the problem of refining camera poses and 3D point coordinates by optimizing the reprojection error. Adapting BA to handle RS images is a main focus.

- Measurement normalization: The paper shows that normalizing image measurements improves RSBA accuracy by making the approximation errors more symmetric. 

- Reprojection error covariance: The paper models the covariance of the RS reprojection errors and uses it to weight the errors during optimization. This improves accuracy and handles degeneracies.

- Planar degeneracy: A problematic configuration in RSBA where camera readout directions are similar, causing the scene to collapse to a plane. The proposed method avoids this.

- Acceleration: The paper presents techniques to accelerate RSBA based on sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, using Schur complements.

- Implementation: The proposed RSBA method is implemented and demonstrated by integrating it into VisualSFM for SfM and ORB-SLAM for SLAM.

In summary, the key focus is on developing an accurate, efficient, and robust RSBA solution without restrictive assumptions that can be easily integrated into existing 3D vision pipelines. The proposed normalization, weighting, degeneracy handling, and acceleration techniques address the limitations of prior RSBA methods.
