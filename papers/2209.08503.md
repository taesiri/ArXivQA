# [Revisiting Rolling Shutter Bundle Adjustment: Toward Accurate and Fast   Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08503)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an accurate and efficient bundle adjustment solution for unordered rolling shutter images without restrictive assumptions on camera motions or image capture manner. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Normalizing the image measurements can improve the accuracy of rolling shutter bundle adjustment by providing a more symmetric error distribution for the optimizer. 

2. Modelling and weighting the reprojection errors based on their covariance can further improve accuracy and avoid degenerate solutions.

3. Exploiting the sparsity in the Jacobian matrix can significantly accelerate the optimization process.

The authors propose a new normalized weighted rolling shutter bundle adjustment method (NW-RSBA) that incorporates these ideas. They demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and real data that NW-RSBA achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to prior RSBA methods. The main contribution is providing an accurate, efficient, and general RSBA solution that can be easily integrated into existing 3D reconstruction pipelines.
