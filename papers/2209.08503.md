# [Revisiting Rolling Shutter Bundle Adjustment: Toward Accurate and Fast   Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08503)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an accurate and efficient bundle adjustment solution for unordered rolling shutter images without restrictive assumptions on camera motions or image capture manner. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Normalizing the image measurements can improve the accuracy of rolling shutter bundle adjustment by providing a more symmetric error distribution for the optimizer. 

2. Modelling and weighting the reprojection errors based on their covariance can further improve accuracy and avoid degenerate solutions.

3. Exploiting the sparsity in the Jacobian matrix can significantly accelerate the optimization process.

The authors propose a new normalized weighted rolling shutter bundle adjustment method (NW-RSBA) that incorporates these ideas. They demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and real data that NW-RSBA achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to prior RSBA methods. The main contribution is providing an accurate, efficient, and general RSBA solution that can be easily integrated into existing 3D reconstruction pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. They investigate the influence of image point normalization on RSBA performance and show its advantages. 

2. They present an analytical model for the visual residual covariance, which helps standardize the reprojection error during RSBA and improve overall accuracy.

3. They propose a normalized weighted RSBA (NW-RSBA) which combines normalization and covariance weighting. NW-RSBA can avoid common planar degeneracy without constraining the camera capture manner.

4. They propose an acceleration strategy for NW-RSBA based on sparsity of the Jacobian matrix and a two-stage Schur complement approach. 

5. They show NW-RSBA can be easily implemented and plugged into existing SfM/SLAM pipelines to handle rolling shutter cameras. 

6. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, they demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of NW-RSBA over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and speed.

In summary, the key contribution is an accurate, efficient, and robust RSBA solution that can be easily integrated into existing 3D vision systems to enable rolling shutter support. The normalization, weighting, acceleration strategies, and extensive validations are the main novelties presented.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an accurate and efficient bundle adjustment solution for unordered rolling shutter image sets that handles planar degeneracy by normalizing image measurements and weighting the reprojection errors based on a covariance model, and accelerates the optimization using a two-stage Schur complement on the sparse Jacobian.
