# [CMDAG: A Chinese Metaphor Dataset with Annotated Grounds as CoT for   Boosting Metaphor Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Metaphors are an important linguistic device but generating creative and coherent metaphors automatically is challenging. 
- Existing Chinese metaphor datasets lack detailed annotations (e.g. grounds/mappings between concepts) to enable better metaphor generation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a large-scale Chinese Metaphor Dataset (CMDAG) with 28K sentences from diverse literary sources.
- Annotate each metaphor with tenor, vehicle and importantly ground (the conceptual mapping between concepts).
- Propose a evaluation method using chain-of-thought prompting to generate metaphors based on grounds. 

Key Contributions:
1. CMDAG dataset with detailed metaphor annotations to enable better metaphor processing.
2. Comprehensive annotation guidelines to ensure accuracy in identifying tenors, vehicles and grounds.
3. First work to introduce chain-of-thought prompting using grounds to boost metaphor generation rather than just combining tenors and vehicles.
4. Evaluation on state-of-the-art models shows the dataset enables creative and fluent metaphor generation, validating its utility.

In summary, the paper presents a uniquely annotated Chinese metaphor dataset designed specifically to aid metaphor generation. Detailed evaluations demonstrate its ability to boost performance for this challenging language generation task.
