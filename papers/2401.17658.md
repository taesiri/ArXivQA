# [Document Structure in Long Document Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Long documents like research papers and reports exhibit hierarchical structure (sections, subsections, paragraphs) that helps humans navigate and comprehend them. 
- However, most NLP models today treat documents as flat, unstructured sequences of text after pre-processing.
- Little is known about whether Transformer models can implicitly learn representations of document structure, and whether providing explicit structural information can improve performance.

Methodology:
- The authors develop a framework to represent document structure as intertextual graphs with nodes for structural elements and edges encoding hierarchy/order.
- They design a suite of probing tasks to evaluate whether models acquire implicit understanding of structure during pre-training, using LED and LongT5 models. 
- They propose general methods to infuse structural information into models by adding special tokens and position embeddings.
- They test structure infusion on the probing tasks as well as question answering and evidence inference downstream tasks using scientific documents.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of document structure representations in Transformers using probing methodology.
- Novel graph-based framework to represent structure across document formats and NLP tasks.
- New general-purpose techniques for structure infusion that require minimal architecture changes. 
- Analysis showing pre-trained models have some implicit structural knowledge that can be improved via infusion, leading to gains in downstream tasks.
- Publicly released data and code to facilitate research on role of structure in NLP.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards understanding and enhancing document structure representations in Transformers to potentially improve long-document NLP.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the study of document structure in long-document transformers:

1. It develops a new suite of probing tasks to assess the internal representation of document structure in pretrained models like LED and LongT5. Experiments show these models acquire some implicit understanding of structure like node type and hierarchy during pretraining.

2. It proposes general-purpose methods to infuse additional structural information into transformer models by adding special tokens and positional embeddings. Infusing aspects like node depth and type is shown to enhance model structure-awareness. 

3. Infusion experiments on downstream tasks QASPER and Evidence Inference demonstrate performance gains from making models more structure-aware, with LED and LongT5 improving by up to 2.28 and 6.84 F1.

4. There is significant correlation found between the probing tasks and downstream performance, suggesting it is indeed the improved representation of document structure leading to gains.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive analysis of the role of document structure in transformers - assessing intrinsic structure-awareness through probing, showing it can be improved via infusion, and demonstrating the downstream utility of structure-aware modeling. The analysis toolkit and findings lay the foundation for future work on structure in NLP.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Document structure - The paper focuses on abstract document structure like sections, paragraphs, etc. and how it is represented in Transformer models.

- Long-document Transformers - The paper studies models like LED and LongT5 that are designed to process long text documents. 

- Probing tasks - A suite of tasks is introduced to analyze whether models represent document structure.

- Structure infusion - Methods to provide additional structural information to models by modifying the input. 

- Downstream tasks - The effects of structure infusion are analyzed on question answering and evidence inference datasets. 

- Intertextual graphs - A graph-based formalism used to represent hierarchical document structure.

- Structure-awareness - The ability of models to represent and utilize document structure. A key research question studied.

So in summary, the key themes are understanding and improving document structure representations in long-document Transformer models, using probing tasks and structure infusion. The graph formalism and downstream datasets are research instruments for this purpose.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new suite of probing tasks to assess the internal representation of document structure in Transformer models. What are the key aspects of document structure that these probing tasks aim to measure and why were they selected?

2. The paper proposes two main approaches for "structure infusion" - adding special tokens and position embeddings. What is the motivation behind using these two pathways and what are the potential advantages and disadvantages of each? 

3. The structure infusion experiments use a combination of special tokens and position embeddings in some configurations (e.g. emb-depth-tok-type). What is the rationale behind combining the two pathways and does the paper provide any evidence that this works better than using just one?

4. The paper finds that structure infusion leads to improved performance on downstream tasks like question answering and evidence inference. Does this necessarily mean the model has a "better" internal representation of structure or could there be other explanations? How might we further analyze this?

5. The paper uses scientific papers for probing and two scientific QA datasets (QASPER and Evidence Inference) for downstream evaluation. Do you think the benefits of explicit structure infusion found here would transfer to other document types like web pages or conversation threads?

6. The structure infusion mechanisms in this paper are format-agnostic and should work for any text converted into the Intertextual Graph format. What are some real-world scenarios or applications where we could benefit from adding structural annotations in this way?

7. The paper LIMITATIONS section mentions that all data comes from the scientific domain. What additional experiments could be done to evaluate whether these findings apply more broadly across domains? What challenges might arise?

8. The results show low probing accuracy on certain structural aspects like sibling and ancestor relationships between nodes. Why might the models struggle with these even after structure infusion? Are there any modifications to the approach that could help capture such relationships? 

9. How suitable do you think the proposed structure infusion approach would be for very large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 that take in raw text without annotations? Would the benefits outweigh the additional preprocessing?

10. The paper uses a "T5-style" denoising loss for pre-training. How important do you think the choice of pre-training objective is when it comes to learning about document structure? Could a more structured pre-training task be beneficial?


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates whether Transformer models acquire internal representations of document structure during pre-training, whether structure-awareness can be enhanced by explicit structure infusion, and what effects infusion has on downstream task performance. The results on LED and LongT5 suggest they acquire implicit structure understanding during pre-training that can be improved via infusion, leading to downstream performance gains.
