# [City Scene Super-Resolution via Geometric Error Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing super-resolution methods focus on pixel-level details but often fail to preserve geometric structures, especially in complex urban scenes crucial for cultural heritage applications. Most methods take a one-size-fits-all approach and are not specialized for city landscapes. This causes inaccuracies in representing architectural elements and overlooks unique characteristics of urban environments.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel single-image super-resolution method tailored for city scenes by minimizing geometric errors during upsampling. It utilizes the Hough Transform to extract regular shapes and lines abundant in urban areas, enabling the computation of a geometric align loss between low-resolution (LR) and super-resolution (SR) images. By combining this geometric loss with a mean squared error (MSE) loss, the method generates higher quality SR images that maintain essential geometric regularities while enhancing details.

Key Contributions:

1. A specialized super-resolution approach for city scenes that constrains geometric loss alongside pixel loss to effectively preserve image structures.

2. Introduction of the Hough Transform for geometric feature extraction which provides constraints to guide the neural network in urban environments containing many regular shapes.

3. Extensive validation on Cityscapes and GSV-Cities datasets demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting capabilities for cultural heritage preservation tasks requiring geometric accuracy.

In summary, the paper presents a geometry-aware super-resolution technique tailored for city landscapes. By prioritizing structural integrity alongside visual details, it enables more contextually and visually faithful reconstruction of intricate urban scenes compared to existing approaches. The specialization for city images and geometric focus allows richer cultural heritage representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.
