## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper surveys the progress and challenges of in-context learning (ICL), a new paradigm in natural language processing where large language models like GPT-3 make predictions based only on a few demonstration examples provided in the input context. The authors first give a formal definition of ICL and discuss how it differs from related concepts like few-shot learning and prompt tuning. They then provide an overview of techniques for enhancing ICL, including model warmup strategies like supervised meta-training and self-supervised objectives, demonstration design strategies for selecting, ordering and formatting examples, and scoring functions for making predictions from the model. Current progress is organized following a taxonomy spanning training, demonstration design, scoring, evaluation resources, applications, and analytical studies on the factors influencing ICL performance. Finally, open challenges are discussed including the need for tailored pretraining objectives, robust and efficient prompting strategies, better evaluation methodologies, distilling ICL abilities to smaller models, and gaining a deeper understanding of how and why ICL works. Overall, this comprehensive survey highlights the rapid growth in ICL research and maps out promising future directions in this area.
