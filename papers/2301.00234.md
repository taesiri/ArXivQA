## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for in-context learning, where large language models like GPT-3 are able to perform tasks by learning from just a few examples provided in the context. The key idea is to leverage the pretrained capabilities of large language models by feeding them a natural language prompt containing a few demonstrations of the task followed by the input. For example, to perform sentiment classification, the prompt would contain a couple example sentences labeled with their sentiment, and then the input sentence to classify. Without any gradient updates or finetuning, the language model is expected to recognize the pattern from the examples and make predictions on new inputs accordingly. The scoring function, which determines how to convert the model's output into a prediction, is a key component that can take different forms like perplexity or direct probability. Overall, this in-context learning approach provides an interpretable human-like interface for incorporating human knowledge into large language models, while avoiding expensive retraining.
