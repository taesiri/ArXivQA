# A Survey on In-context Learning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research questions and goals of this paper are:1. To survey and summarize the progress and challenges of in-context learning (ICL). The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape on ICL.2. To present a formal definition of ICL and clarify its correlation with related concepts like prompt learning and few-shot learning. 3. To organize and discuss advanced techniques for ICL, including training strategies, demonstration designing strategies, scoring functions, and analytical studies.4. To highlight the main challenges of ICL and propose potential future research directions. 5. To provide useful resources like evaluation datasets and tools to facilitate future ICL research.In summary, this survey paper focuses on thoroughly reviewing the ICL literature, formalizing the problem, discussing the latest techniques, identifying challenges, and outlining promising research directions - with the goal of promoting further advances in this rapidly growing area. The authors aim to bring more attention to ICL and shed light on how it works and how it can be improved.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It provides the first comprehensive survey on in-context learning (ICL), a new learning paradigm for large language models (LLMs) where models make predictions based on a few demonstration examples. 2. It gives a formal definition of ICL and compares it with related concepts like few-shot learning and prompt tuning.3. It systematically categorizes and reviews the current progress in ICL research, including model warmup strategies, demonstration designing techniques, scoring functions, analytical studies, evaluation benchmarks and resources, applications, etc.4. It highlights the main challenges of ICL and proposes potential future research directions, such as new pretraining strategies, ICL ability distillation, enhancing robustness and efficiency/scalability of ICL. 5. It extends the discussion of ICL to multimodal domains like vision, speech and vision-language tasks.In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners interested in ICL, summarizes the current research landscape, and paves the way for future studies to further advance this promising learning paradigm. The taxonomy, literature review, and insights on challenges and opportunities are the main contributions that make this paper a valuable survey and reference.
