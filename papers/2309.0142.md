# [Block occurrences in the binary expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0142)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:How does the binary expansion of an integer behave under addition, in particular with respect to counting occurrences of a given block/pattern? More specifically, the authors study the block-additive function r(n) which counts the number of (overlapping) occurrences of the block 11 in the binary expansion of n. The main result is a central limit theorem stating that the difference r(n+t)-r(n) follows an approximate Gaussian distribution when t has many blocks of 1s in its binary expansion. This provides insight into how adding a constant t changes the binary expansion of n in a statistical sense.The authors also discuss connections to the famous Cusick conjecture regarding how the binary sum-of-digits function s(n) changes under addition. Their results and techniques represent progress towards resolving Cusick's conjecture. Overall, this line of research aims to better understand the additive behavior of the binary expansion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper studies the number of overlapping occurrences of the block "11" in the binary expansions of integers. The main contributions are:- It proves a central limit theorem showing that the difference in the number of "11" blocks between n+t and n approximately follows a Gaussian distribution when t has many blocks of 1's in its binary expansion. - It establishes bounds on the variance of this distribution, showing it grows linearly with the number of blocks in t.- It provides an effective error bound on the approximation by the Gaussian, with the error going to 0 as the number of blocks in t goes to infinity.- It raises an analog of Cusick's conjecture for this "11 block counting" function, asking if adding a constant t makes the number of blocks increase more often than decrease.So in summary, it proves a sharpened central limit theorem for the "11 block counting" function, parallel to recent results on the binary sum-of-digits function, while also introducing some new open problems analogous to longstanding conjectures in that setting. The main innovation seems to be establishing the strengthened error bounds on the Gaussian approximation using a refined matrix analysis.
