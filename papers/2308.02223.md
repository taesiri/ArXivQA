# [ESRL: Efficient Sampling-based Reinforcement Learning for Sequence   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02223)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we make reinforcement learning (RL) more efficient when applying it to sequence generation models like neural machine translation and abstractive summarization?The key challenges the paper aims to address are:1) The large action space (vocabulary size) and long sequence lengths typically present in sequence generation tasks make naive application of RL very computationally expensive.2) The sampling/exploration process used in RL for these tasks is inefficient, requiring a lot of redundant sampling. To address these challenges, the main contribution of the paper is proposing an efficient sampling-based RL method (ESRL) that uses:1) A two-stage sampling approach to avoid excessive storage of computational graphs during the sampling process. 2) Dynamic sampling that adjusts the sampling size and temperature based on estimating the model's current capability on each input. This aims to reduce redundant sampling.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by making the sampling process during RL more efficient, they can make training sequence generation models with RL more feasible and effective. The two main research ideas are the two-stage sampling and dynamic sampling techniques proposed under their ESRL method.
