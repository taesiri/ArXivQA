# [ESRL: Efficient Sampling-based Reinforcement Learning for Sequence   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02223)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we make reinforcement learning (RL) more efficient when applying it to sequence generation models like neural machine translation and abstractive summarization?The key challenges the paper aims to address are:1) The large action space (vocabulary size) and long sequence lengths typically present in sequence generation tasks make naive application of RL very computationally expensive.2) The sampling/exploration process used in RL for these tasks is inefficient, requiring a lot of redundant sampling. To address these challenges, the main contribution of the paper is proposing an efficient sampling-based RL method (ESRL) that uses:1) A two-stage sampling approach to avoid excessive storage of computational graphs during the sampling process. 2) Dynamic sampling that adjusts the sampling size and temperature based on estimating the model's current capability on each input. This aims to reduce redundant sampling.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by making the sampling process during RL more efficient, they can make training sequence generation models with RL more feasible and effective. The two main research ideas are the two-stage sampling and dynamic sampling techniques proposed under their ESRL method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing an efficient sampling-based reinforcement learning (RL) method for sequence generation called ESRL. The key ideas are:- Using a two-stage sampling framework to reduce excessive computational graph storage requirements during the sampling process. This takes advantage of Transformer parallelism computation.- Introducing a dynamic sampling approach to adjust the sampling size and temperature based on estimating the model's generation capability. This aims to reduce unnecessary exploration.2. Evaluating ESRL on machine translation and abstractive summarization tasks. Results show ESRL can achieve similar or better performance than baseline RL methods like REINFORCE and minimum risk training, while being much more efficient in terms of training time and memory usage.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of ESRL for RL from human feedback by training a large language model. ESRL remained more memory-efficient and faster compared to proximal policy optimization, while achieving better generation quality.4. Providing ablation studies and analysis investigating the impact of different components of ESRL like the two-stage sampling, dynamic sampling, and using a FIFO queue for estimating baseline rewards.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a new efficient sampling-based RL approach to train sequence generation models that makes RL more feasible for large action spaces and sequence lengths. The efficiency comes from techniques to reduce unnecessary sampling and storage requirements.
