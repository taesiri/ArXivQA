# [Rig3DGS: Creating Controllable Portraits from Casual Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Rig3DGS: Creating Controllable Portraits from Casual Monocular Videos":

Problem:
Creating controllable 3D human portraits from casual smartphone videos is very useful for AR/VR applications, but is challenging. Key difficulties include accurately modeling and disentangling head movements and facial expressions from a single-view video to achieve high-quality renderings. Prior work using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) is slow for this task. Recent 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) methods improve quality and efficiency but cannot represent dynamic content.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces Rig3DGS, which represents the entire dynamic scene using 3D Gaussians in a canonical space. Control signals like head pose and expressions are used to transform the Gaussians to a 3D space with learned deformations to generate the desired rendering. The key innovation is carefully designing the deformation method to be guided by a learnable prior derived from a 3D morphable face model. 

Specifically, the deformation of each Gaussian from canonical to deformed space is predicted as a weighted sum of the deformations of its closest vertices on the morphable model mesh. The weights are optimized via photometric loss on ground truth images. By constraining each Gaussian's deformation to lie in a subspace of vertex deformations, the otherwise ill-posed problem of learning per-point deformations without ground truth is effectively regularized.

Contributions:
- Proposes a novel deformation model learned in the subspace defined by a 3D morphable model, enabling generalization to novel expressions and poses during reanimation.

- Introduces Rig3DGS method to create reanimatable portraits from monocular videos with control over facial expressions, head poses, and view synthesis of the entire scene.

- Demonstrates significant improvement in rendering quality over prior neural portrait work, with novel expressions, poses, and view synthesis, while being 50 times faster due to 3D Gaussian scene representation.

In summary, the paper presents a way to create controllable 3D portraits from casual monocular videos by using 3D Gaussians and constraining their deformations based on a morphable face model. This achieves higher quality and faster renders than previous methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Rig3DGS, a method to create controllable 3D human portraits from casual monocular videos by representing the scene with 3D Gaussians and using a learnable deformation prior derived from a 3D morphable model to enable control over facial expressions, head poses, and novel view synthesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel deformation model learned in the subspace of the deformation defined by a 3D morphable model. This enables generalization to novel facial expressions and head-poses during reanimation.

2. Proposing Rig3DGS, a method that rigs 3D gaussians to enable the creation of reanimatable portraits with full control over facial expressions, head-pose and novel view synthesis of the entire scene from a casually-captured monocular smartphone video.

3. Demonstrating significant improvement in rendering quality over prior work on neural portraits with novel facial expressions, head-poses and novel views synthesis of the entire scene while being 50 times faster due to representing the scene as 3D gaussians.

The paper introduces "Rig3DGS", a method to create controllable 3D portraits from casual monocular videos captured on a smartphone. The key idea is to represent the dynamic scene using 3D Gaussians and deform them based on control parameters like facial expressions and head poses. A learnable prior derived from a 3D morphable face model is used to constrain the deformation and enable better generalization. The method demonstrates facial reanimation and novel view synthesis from a single video. The main contributions include the deformation model with a learnable prior, a way to "rig" 3D Gaussians for portrait video reanimation, and quantitative/qualitative experiments showing improvements over prior portrait generation techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel deformation model that is learned in the subspace of the deformation defined by a 3D morphable model. Can you explain in more detail how this deformation model works and why constraining the deformation to this subspace helps achieve better generalization to novel expressions and poses?

2. The core of the method relies on deforming an initial point cloud of 3D Gaussians from a canonical space to a deformed space in order to render novel views. What is the intuition behind representing the scene, including the dynamic human subject, as 3D Gaussians rather than using another scene representation?

3. How does the method establish correspondence between the 3D Gaussians across different expressions and poses? What are the advantages of the proposed approach over other techniques for establishing correspondences? 

4. Explain in detail the loss functions used to train the model, especially the terms that regularize the predicted deformations. Why are these regularization losses important?

5. The method predicts the deformation of each Gaussian as a weighted sum of the deformations of its closest vertices on the FLAME mesh. Walk through how these vertex weights are calculated and why this is beneficial.

6. Besides the deformation model, how does the method predict the rotation and scaling of the Gaussians from canonical to deformed space? What are the benefits of the approach taken?

7. One of the key benefits stated is that the method is 50 times faster than prior work RigNeRF during inference. Analyze the differences between the two methods that contribute to these runtime improvements.

8. What are some of the limitations of the current method? How might the approach be extended to handling challenges like extreme poses, facial hair, accessories etc.?

9. Critically analyze how the quantitative experiments and comparisons were set up. What are some ways the evaluations could have been made more comprehensive or fair?

10. The method relies on deformations from a FLAME model. How sensitive is performance based on the quality of the driving FLAME parameters? Could the approach be adapted to use other morphable models of faces or humans?
