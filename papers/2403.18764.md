# [Temporal Logic Formalisation of ISO 34502 Critical Scenarios: Modular   Construction with the RSS Safety Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Safety assurance of automated driving vehicles (ADVs) is critical for their social acceptance. Scenario-based testing is a promising approach, where ADVs are tested against a library of critical driving scenarios. 
- Formalisation of scenarios in a rigorous language like temporal logic aids mechanised processing for testing and monitoring. The ISO 34502 standard provides a systematic methodology to identify critical driving scenarios in a structured manner.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a temporal logic (STL) formalisation of an important class of critical scenarios from ISO 34502 - traffic disturbance scenarios for general vehicles on highways.  
- The formalisation has two key features:
   1. Modular composition of logical formulas following the compositional methodology of ISO 34502, aiding systematic and comprehensive coverage.
   2. Use of Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) distance to define danger. This provides stability with fewer parameters to tune.
- Formulas detect disturbances based on violation of safe RSS distance between vehicles after a safe period. Additional constraints capture scenario-specific vehicle behaviours.

Main Contributions:
- Logical formalisation of 24 traffic disturbance scenarios from ISO 34502 in a modular and parameter-efficient manner
- Methodology combining compositionality and RSS distance for formalising driving scenarios
- Experimental evaluation on a standard dataset demonstrating high recall in detecting disturbances  
- Analysis of adequacy of ISO 34502 descriptions for detecting vs classifying disturbances
- Prototype tool for deriving and debugging STL formulas 

The formalisation enables automated monitoring and testing of ADVs against these critical scenarios using existing tools. Future work includes coverage of more scenario classes and implementation in languages supporting variable binding.
