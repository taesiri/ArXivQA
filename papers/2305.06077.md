# [Relightify: Relightable 3D Faces from a Single Image via Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can diffusion models be used as a prior for highly accurate 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image?The key points related to this question seem to be:- The authors propose the first approach to use diffusion models as a prior for 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image. - They train an unconditional diffusion model on a dataset of facial reflectance maps (diffuse/specular albedo, normals) paired with corresponding rendered textures under varying illumination. - At test time, they fit a 3DMM to the input image to obtain a partial UV texture, and sample from the diffusion model to inpaint missing pixels and reflectance components.- By preserving the observed texture from the input and inpainting only missing areas, they achieve more accurate reflectance prediction and texture completion compared to previous methods.- The reconstructed 3D face can be realistically relighted since the method outputs a complete set of rendering assets (texture, diffuse albedo, specular albedo, normals).So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a diffusion model trained on facial reflectance can serve as an effective prior for jointly completing texture and estimating reflectance from a single facial image, enabling relightable 3D avatar creation. The experiments aim to validate the accuracy of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Presenting the first diffusion-based approach for relightable 3D face reconstruction from monocular images. - Proposing an efficient way to predict different modalities (texture, diffuse albedo, specular albedo, normals) in a consistent manner by learning a generative model on concatenated reflectance maps and casting reconstruction as an inpainting problem.- Achieving superior performance in both texture completion and reflectance reconstruction tasks compared to previous methods through qualitative and quantitative evaluations.In summary, the key contribution is using a diffusion model trained on high-quality texture/reflectance data to enable high-fidelity relightable 3D face reconstruction from a single image. The model is used in an inpainting approach to complete a partial UV texture from a 3DMM fitting, recovering both the texture and reflectance maps in a consistent manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a diffusion model-based approach for reconstructing relightable 3D faces with realistic textures and reflectance properties from a single image.
