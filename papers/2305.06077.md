# [Relightify: Relightable 3D Faces from a Single Image via Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can diffusion models be used as a prior for highly accurate 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image?The key points related to this question seem to be:- The authors propose the first approach to use diffusion models as a prior for 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image. - They train an unconditional diffusion model on a dataset of facial reflectance maps (diffuse/specular albedo, normals) paired with corresponding rendered textures under varying illumination. - At test time, they fit a 3DMM to the input image to obtain a partial UV texture, and sample from the diffusion model to inpaint missing pixels and reflectance components.- By preserving the observed texture from the input and inpainting only missing areas, they achieve more accurate reflectance prediction and texture completion compared to previous methods.- The reconstructed 3D face can be realistically relighted since the method outputs a complete set of rendering assets (texture, diffuse albedo, specular albedo, normals).So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a diffusion model trained on facial reflectance can serve as an effective prior for jointly completing texture and estimating reflectance from a single facial image, enabling relightable 3D avatar creation. The experiments aim to validate the accuracy of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Presenting the first diffusion-based approach for relightable 3D face reconstruction from monocular images. - Proposing an efficient way to predict different modalities (texture, diffuse albedo, specular albedo, normals) in a consistent manner by learning a generative model on concatenated reflectance maps and casting reconstruction as an inpainting problem.- Achieving superior performance in both texture completion and reflectance reconstruction tasks compared to previous methods through qualitative and quantitative evaluations.In summary, the key contribution is using a diffusion model trained on high-quality texture/reflectance data to enable high-fidelity relightable 3D face reconstruction from a single image. The model is used in an inpainting approach to complete a partial UV texture from a 3DMM fitting, recovering both the texture and reflectance maps in a consistent manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a diffusion model-based approach for reconstructing relightable 3D faces with realistic textures and reflectance properties from a single image.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of 3D facial reconstruction and reflectance estimation:- This is the first work to apply diffusion models for relightable 3D face reconstruction from a single image. Diffusion models have shown great success for image generation, but have not been explored before for this application. The use of a diffusion model as a strong facial prior enables joint texture completion and reflectance estimation.- The method builds on recent advances in image inpainting with diffusion models like RePaint and MCG, but extends them to handle multiple modalities (texture and reflectance maps) in a consistent manner. The inpainting formulation allows preserving texture details from the input image.- Compared to other 3DMM fitting methods like GANFit and RingNet, this approach focuses more on reflectance estimation rather than just shape and texture recovery. The reflectance maps allow photorealistic relighting.- The results surpass state-of-the-art methods like AvatarMe++ and AlbedoMM in texture completion quantitative metrics and visual quality. The identity preservation is also superior based on the LFW evaluation.- The approach does not require problem-specific training of the diffusion model like some prior work. The same generative model can be used for diverse inputs.- Limitations compared to hybrid texture & geometry estimation methods like GRF or PIFuHD include lower shape detail and the requirement of an initial 3DMM fit.So in summary, the key novelties are the use of diffusion models for this task, the flexible inpainting approach, and the strong performance in reflectance estimation and relighting while preserving input facial details well. The tradeoffs are somewhat lower geometric detail and reliance on an initial 3DMM fit compared to some hybrid geometry & texture estimation methods. Overall it advances the state-of-the-art in facial avatars from monocular images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Improving the generalization ability of the method for ethnic groups and facial expressions that may be under-represented in the training data. The authors suggest incorporating more diverse high-quality ground truth data with captured reflectance could help with this.- Combining the method with solutions like TRUST that aim to resolve the ambiguity between albedo and illumination. The authors state this could improve performance in the future.- Using an upsampling network on low resolution inputs to improve the quality of reconstructed UV maps in those cases. - Exploring the application of the diffusion model framework to other inverse graphics problems beyond faces, such as full body avatar creation.- Investigating alternative conditioning approaches during sampling that could encourage better physical plausibility or consistency with human perception.- Reducing the computational requirements of the method further, to make it more practical for real-time usage.In summary, the main future directions mentioned are around improving generalization, handling ambiguity, efficiency, and exploring new applications of the overall framework. The authors see promise in diffusion models for inverse graphics problems in general.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents Relightify, a method for generating relightable 3D faces from a single image using diffusion models. The key idea is to train an unconditional diffusion model on a dataset of facial textures and corresponding reflectance maps (diffuse albedo, specular albedo, normals). At test time, a 3D morphable model is fit to the input image to obtain a partial UV texture map. This partial texture is used to guide the sampling process of the diffusion model to inpaint the missing areas of the texture as well as synthesize the reflectance maps. By preserving the observed texture details from the input image while predicting the occluded areas and reflectance in a consistent manner, Relightify generates accurate and realistic 3D avatars that can be rendered under novel lighting. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over previous methods on tasks like texture completion and reflectance prediction. The method requires only a single image as input and outputs a full set of rendering assets for photorealistic relighting.
