# [Relightify: Relightable 3D Faces from a Single Image via Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06077)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can diffusion models be used as a prior for highly accurate 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image?The key points related to this question seem to be:- The authors propose the first approach to use diffusion models as a prior for 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image. - They train an unconditional diffusion model on a dataset of facial reflectance maps (diffuse/specular albedo, normals) paired with corresponding rendered textures under varying illumination. - At test time, they fit a 3DMM to the input image to obtain a partial UV texture, and sample from the diffusion model to inpaint missing pixels and reflectance components.- By preserving the observed texture from the input and inpainting only missing areas, they achieve more accurate reflectance prediction and texture completion compared to previous methods.- The reconstructed 3D face can be realistically relighted since the method outputs a complete set of rendering assets (texture, diffuse albedo, specular albedo, normals).So in summary, the key hypothesis is that a diffusion model trained on facial reflectance can serve as an effective prior for jointly completing texture and estimating reflectance from a single facial image, enabling relightable 3D avatar creation. The experiments aim to validate the accuracy of this approach.
