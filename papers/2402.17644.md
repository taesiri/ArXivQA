# [Are LLMs Capable of Data-based Statistical and Causal Reasoning?   Benchmarking Advanced Quantitative Reasoning with Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17644)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is limited assessment of language models' ability for advanced quantitative reasoning, especially statistical and causal reasoning using real-world data.
- Existing benchmarks evaluate quantitative reasoning without data or only require basic data analysis skills. No benchmark focuses on advanced reasoning with data.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the Quantitative Reasoning with Data (QRData) benchmark to assess language models' capabilities in statistical and causal reasoning using data.
- QRData has 411 questions from textbooks and research papers, accompanied by 195 real data sheets. Questions cover concepts like confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, average treatment effects, etc.
- An auxiliary text-only dataset QRText is provided for analysis and comparison. 
- Evaluate various language models and reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought, Program-of-Thoughts, ReAct prompts and code interpreter assistants.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark requiring advanced quantitative reasoning skills with real data, assessing statistical and causal reasoning abilities.
- Analysis of language models and reasoning methods on the new benchmark. Code and data publicly available.
- Insights into difficulties faced by models regarding data analysis and integration of causal knowledge with data.
- Calls attention to evaluating and enhancing data-based quantitative reasoning skills of language models.

The paper introduces an important new benchmark to push research towards more advanced quantitative reasoning abilities of language models using real-world data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces QRData, a new benchmark to evaluate large language models' capabilities in statistical and causal reasoning with real-world data, finding that current models still struggle with data analysis and integrating causal knowledge with provided data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes the Quantitative Reasoning with Data (QRData) benchmark to assess models' abilities for data-based statistical and causal reasoning. The main contributions are:

1) Proposing QRData, the first benchmark focused on evaluating advanced quantitative reasoning skills with real-world data, including statistical reasoning and causal reasoning questions.

2) Evaluating various models and reasoning approaches on QRData, such as natural language reasoning, program-based reasoning, and agent reasoning. The results provide insights into effective methods for tackling the benchmark.

3) Analyzing the primary difficulties faced by current models on the benchmark, which are challenges with data analysis and limitations in causal reasoning abilities. Even powerful models struggle to integrate causal knowledge with provided data.

In summary, the key contribution is the new QRData benchmark for quantitatively evaluating models' statistical and causal reasoning capacities using real data. The analysis also reveals deficiencies of current models in applying quantitative reasoning skills to data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes the Quantitative Reasoning with Data (QRData) benchmark to assess models' abilities in statistical and causal reasoning. What are some key advantages of using real-world datasets compared to synthetically generated data for evaluating these reasoning abilities?

2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables natural language reasoning through intermediate steps. However, the results using CoT were close to or worse than random guessing. What are some reasons this method may have underperformed on the QRData benchmark?

3) What additional challenges does the QRData benchmark pose compared to existing table question answering datasets? Discuss the needs for multi-turn reasoning and integration of domain knowledge.

4) The paper finds that program-based reasoning using Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) works well for code-focused models like Deepseek-coder-instruct but not as well for general language models. Why might this be the case?

5) For agent reasoning using ReAct-style prompting, closed-source large models like GPT-4 perform much better than smaller open-source models. What factors account for this performance gap?

6) Statistical reasoning focuses on patterns in data while causal reasoning identifies causal relationships. Why is there such a significant gap in model performance between these two types of reasoning, even for powerful models like GPT-4?

7) The model comparisons show code generation abilities are important for quantitative reasoning with data. However, scale also matters as large general-purpose LMs outperform code LMs. Why might coding ability alone not be enough?  

8) What evidence suggests that causal reasoning itself poses a challenge for LLM models, separate from the data analysis component? How do the QRText results support this?

9) The error analysis reveals data analysis issues account for 34% of GPT-4's failures. What specific problems lead to errors in data analysis? How could they be addressed?

10) For causal reasoning questions, providing models the data sometimes leads to worse performance compared to just the question text. Why does the additional information seem to confuse reasoning in these cases? How can models better integrate text and data?
