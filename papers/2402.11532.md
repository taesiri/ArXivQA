# [Chain-of-Instructions: Compositional Instruction Tuning on Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11532)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language models (LLMs) excel at single instruction tasks but struggle to follow complex, multi-step instructions. 
- There is a lack of compositional instruction datasets to train models on sequential, chained instructions.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce the concept of "Chain-of-Instructions" (CoI) - a series of instructions where the output of one step becomes the input to the next.
- Automatically construct a CoI dataset by:
   1) Summarizing lengthy single instructions
   2) Checking if instruction outputs can feed into inputs of subsequent instructions 
   3) Generate full CoI examples with chained instructions
- Fine-tune LLMs (Alpaca, Mistral) on CoI datasets

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of Chain-of-Instructions (CoI) tasks with formal definition
- Pipeline to automatically construct CoI dataset with minimal supervision 
- New CoI dataset created from existing NLP instructions
- Methodology for CoI tuning - fine-tuning models on CoI data
- Experiments showing CoI-tuned models outperform baselines on:
   - Compositional instruction test sets
   - Generalization - unseen single instructions
   - Downstream task - multilingual summarization

In summary, the paper introduces the concept and task formulation of Chain-of-Instructions (CoI) to assess and improve LLM's capabilities on complex, multi-step instructions. It provides an automatic pipeline to construct CoI datasets and presents experiments demonstrating performance gains from CoI-tuning on compositional, unseen, and downstream tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new concept of compositional instructions called chain-of-instructions, where the output of one instruction becomes the input of the next, to improve language models' ability to follow complex multi-step instructions, and introduces methods to automatically create such instruction datasets as well as experiments showing improved performance on compositional tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new concept of compositional instructions called "chain-of-instructions" (CoI), where the output of one instruction becomes the input for the next instruction in a chained manner. 

2. Creating a new CoI dataset semi-automatically with minimal human supervision. The process involves instruction summarization, composability checking, and CoI instance generation with the help of a large language model.

3. Developing a method to enable LLMs to solve compositional tasks in an explainable way by generating incremental outputs at each step of a complex task chain.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that CoI-tuned models outperform individual instruction models as well as models trained on sequential compositional instructions on both CoI test sets and downstream tasks.

5. Showing that adding compositional instructions during fine-tuning improves performance on difficult unseen single instruction tasks as well, indicating better generalization capability.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the chain-of-instructions concept and dataset to enhance LLMs' ability to follow compositional instructions spanning multiple subtasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new concept called "chain-of-instructions" (CoI). How is this concept different from existing approaches for instruction tuning of large language models? What novel capability does it aim to impart in the models?

2. The paper creates a new CoI dataset in a semi-automatic way with minimal human supervision. Can you explain the 3 main steps involved in their automatic CoI data creation pipeline? What role does the large language model play in each of these steps? 

3. The formulation of the CoI problem requires that the output of one subtask instruction becomes the input for the next subtask instruction, creating a chain. What are the benefits of such chaining of subtask outputs and inputs? How does it help with explainability?

4. What are the different variants of CoI dataset created in the paper (CoI2, CoI3 etc.)? Why create these different chained dataset variants? How do they help analyze model capabilities regarding length of instruction chains?

5. The paper tests CoI-tuned models on single instructions using BIG Bench Hard subset. What hypotheses do the authors have regarding CoI-tuning helping with difficult single instructions? Do the results align with these hypotheses?

6. For the downstream application, the paper uses multilingual summarization using the WikiLingua dataset. Why is multilingual summarization a suitable downstream task for evaluating CoI-tuning? Does the CoI-tuning help for both translation directions - En->Fr and Es->En?

7. What is Concise CoI? Why create this variant with shorter instructions? Does concise CoI tuning work better than just CoI-tuning for some model configurations and tasks?

8. The paper conducts an ablation by creating irrelevant CoI where second subtask outputs are randomly sampled. What effect does this irrelevant output tuning have on model performance? What does this analysis show regarding CoI tuning?

9. The paper conducts human evaluation comparing CoI models and baseline on 200 random instances. What metrics are used for human evaluation? How do the human ratings compare between CoI models and baseline?

10. What are some limitations of the approach? What future work directions do the authors suggest for chain-of-instructions based tuning?
