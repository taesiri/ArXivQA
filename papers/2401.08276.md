# [AesBench: An Expert Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models on   Image Aesthetics Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image aesthetics perception is an important capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), useful in applications like photography, album management, and image enhancement. 
- However, existing benchmarks for MLLMs focus on general language and vision tasks, not specialized aesthetic perception abilities. There is no standard way to evaluate how well MLLMs can perceive, assess, and interpret image aesthetics.

Solution - AesBench Benchmark:  
- The authors construct an Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD) with 2,800 high quality, diversely-sourced images annotated by aesthetic experts.
- They propose an evaluation framework across 4 key criteria: 
   1) Aesthetic Perception (AesP): Recognizing aesthetic attributes
   2) Aesthetic Empathy  (AesE): Resonating with emotions/uniqueness conveyed
   3) Aesthetic Assessment (AesA): Judging aesthetic quality   
   4) Aesthetic Interpretation (AesI): Explaining reasons for aesthetic quality
- This allows systematic benchmarking of aesthetic capabilities across 15 MLLMs.

Key Findings:
- Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate current MLLMs only have limited aesthetic perception abilities compared to humans.  
- The best models exhibit around 50-70% accuracy on aesthetic understanding tasks.
- Results show clear capability gaps to guide further development of MLLMs specialized for aesthetics.

Main Contributions:
- Novel aesthetic benchmark to quantify MLLM aesthetic perception skills over multiple criteria 
- High quality expert-annotated dataset of 2,800 images with aesthetic questions/interpretations
- Extensive experiments revealing limitations of existing MLLMs for aesthetic tasks compared to humans
- Framework and analysis to inspire more research into enhancing aesthetic capabilities of MLLMs


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes AesBench, an expert benchmark with integrative criteria to systematically evaluate the aesthetic perception abilities of multimodal large language models across four dimensions: perception, empathy, assessment, and interpretation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1) It constructs a high-quality Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD) with 2,800 images and over 8,000 expert annotations to serve as a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on image aesthetics perception. 

2) It proposes a comprehensive four-dimensional evaluation framework with criteria spanning Aesthetic Perception, Aesthetic Empathy, Aesthetic Assessment, and Aesthetic Interpretation abilities to systematically benchmark MLLMs.

3) It conducts extensive experiments evaluating 15 MLLMs, including GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision, using the proposed benchmark. The results reveal current MLLMs still have significant gaps compared to humans in abilities related to image aesthetics perception.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of a systematic benchmark (high-quality dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation criteria) to gauge and analyze the image aesthetics perception capacities of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
- Image aesthetics perception
- Aesthetic perception benchmark
- Expert-labeled aesthetics perception database (EAPD)  
- Aesthetic perception (AesP)
- Aesthetic empathy (AesE)
- Aesthetic assessment (AesA) 
- Aesthetic interpretation (AesI)
- Natural images (NIs)
- Artistic images (AIs) 
- AI-generated images (AGIs)

The paper proposes AesBench, a benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on their aesthetic perception abilities across four key criteria - perception, empathy, assessment and interpretation. It also constructs an expert-labeled database (EAPD) of diverse images to serve as a reliable gold standard for the benchmark evaluations. The key focus is on assessing if and how well current MLLMs can understand and reason about image aesthetics compared to human experts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD) as part of the benchmark. What considerations went into selecting the specific image datasets used to construct the EAPD and what impact might the dataset selection have on benchmark results? 

2. The paper evaluates aesthetic perception abilities across 4 key dimensions - Perception, Empathy, Assessment and Interpretation. What motivated this particular set of evaluation perspectives and what other aesthetic capacities, if any, could be valuable to measure in future work?

3. The Aesthetic Perception questions cover 4 perceptual dimensions and 4 question types. What informed the choice of these specific dimensions and types and how might they be expanded upon in future benchmarks? 

4. The paper finds that current MLLMs perform much better on Natural Images compared to Artistic and AI-generated images. What factors contribute to this performance gap and how can MLLMs be improved to better handle artistic and generated aesthetic content?  

5. The benchmark results show there is still a significant gap between MLLMs and human performance in aesthetic assessment. What key challenges exist in developing more reliable aesthetic scoring capacities in MLLMs?

6. The results demonstrate that MLLMs struggle with precision in aesthetic interpretation. Why might models exhibit strong hallucination and lower precision in this area and what techniques could help address this limitation?  

7. Could the text-to-score approach used for fine-grained aesthetic assessment be expanded to the other benchmark tasks as well? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of using such an approach more broadly?

8. The paper does not fine-tune the MLLMs before evaluation. How might additional tuning on aesthetic data impact performance on the various benchmark dimensions? What risks might such tuning introduce?

9. The benchmark currently relies on a GPT-based evaluation strategy for some tasks. Could the benchmark be designed to avoid needing an auxiliary GPT model for evaluation? What would be the benefits and downsides?

10. Beyond aesthetic perception, what other high-level abstract capabilities would be valuable to benchmark for MLLMs and what considerations would go into constructing rigorous benchmarks to measure progress in those spaces?
