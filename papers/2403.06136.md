# [RESTORE: Towards Feature Shift for Vision-Language Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision-language prompt tuning methods tend to sacrifice cross-modal alignment for improved performance on specific downstream tasks/classes, leading to poorer generalization.
- The degradation of generalization is caused by asynchronous and inconsistent updates to visual and textual features during prompt tuning, but the root causes are not well analyzed. 

Proposed Solution:
- Propose the concept of "feature shift" to quantify the variation in representations caused by introduced prompts. 
- Define the inter-modal discrepancy of feature shifts and show it is negatively correlated with model generalization.
- Propose RESTORE method to minimize the inter-modal discrepancy via a feature shift consistency loss for better alignment.
- Introduce a "surgery" block (implemented as an adapter) controlled by the feature shifts to alleviate representation misalignment.

Main Contributions:
- First work to provide quantitative analysis of the underlying reasons behind degraded generalization in vision-language prompt tuning.
- Propose feature shift to measure representation variation and its link to generalization.
- Feature shift consistency loss minimizes inter-modal discrepancy for better alignment.
- "Surgery" block adapts features guided by feature shifts to prevent misalignment.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, this paper provides pivotal analysis to explain the loss of generalization in vision-language prompt tuning, and introduces techniques to enhance alignment across modalities for improved performance. The concept of feature shift is critical in quantifying the representation variation and guiding cross-modal synchronization.
