# [Inherently robust suboptimal MPC for autonomous racing with anytime   feasible SQP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Model predictive control (MPC) is promising for autonomous driving applications, but solving the underlying optimization problem is computationally expensive. 
- Existing MPC solvers either provide locally optimal but slow solutions (e.g. IPOPT), or fast but possibly infeasible solutions (e.g. real-time iteration).
- There is a need for an efficient MPC strategy that retains feasibility guarantees while being fast enough for real-time control.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using a feasible sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm that generates intermediate solutions that are always feasible. 
- This allows the optimization to be terminated early while still having a usable feasible solution, enabling anytime computation suitable for real-time control.

Contributions:
- Propose control strategy based on feasible SQP that is inherently robust to disturbances in system dynamics. Guarantee recursive feasibility under mild assumptions.
- Design time-varying terminal set based on precomputed feasible periodic trajectory over one lap. Allows simple shifting of solution between timesteps.  
- Demonstrate proposed method in simulation and hardware experiments with miniature autonomous race cars. Method computes feasible solutions with only slightly higher computation time compared to fast but infeasible SQP.
- Show that proposed method achieves moderate improvement in trajectory cost compared to standard SQP, and eliminates constraint violations that occur with fast infeasible SQP.

In summary, the key innovation is an MPC strategy using a specialized feasible SQP algorithm that retains recursive feasibility guarantees while requiring only marginally higher computation time compared to a fast infeasible baseline. This makes the proposed method suitable for real-time control in autonomous driving applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient inexact model predictive control strategy for autonomous miniature racing using a feasible sequential quadratic programming algorithm that can provide feasible intermediate iterates, thus enabling anytime termination while retaining recursive feasibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The proposal of an efficient inexact model predictive control (MPC) strategy for autonomous racing using a feasible sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. This algorithm can be terminated after any number of iterations while still providing feasible intermediate solutions. This allows the computation of suboptimal yet feasible control actions with lower computational cost compared to computing locally optimal solutions.

2) Demonstrating inherent robustness properties of the proposed control strategy. Under suitable assumptions on the terminal set and controllability properties, recursive feasibility can be guaranteed for the MPC problem even in the presence of sufficiently small disturbances to the system dynamics. 

3) Validating the proposed method in both simulations and hardware experiments using autonomous miniature race cars. The results show that the feasible SQP method can reliably compute feasible trajectories with only a small increase in computation time compared to non-feasible solvers. The method is also significantly faster than state-of-the-art optimal solvers like IPOPT.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and inherently robust MPC strategy for autonomous racing, enabled by a customized feasible SQP algorithm, with experimental validation on real miniature race cars.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper relies on a feasible sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm from another work. Can you explain in more detail how this algorithm works and specifically how it generates intermediate iterates that are feasible? What modifications were made to the standard SQP formulation?

2) Assumption 1 requires the dynamics to be Lipschitz continuous. Can you provide some intuition on why this assumption is needed for the robust recursive feasibility result? Also, is this a reasonable assumption for the car dynamics model used in this application?

3) Assumption 2 requires existence of a deadbeat controller that can steer states close to the terminal set back into the terminal set within k steps. What guided the design of the terminal set to satisfy this assumption? How was the transitional terminal trajectory computed?

4) The terminal set is parameterized as a discrete set of states forming a periodic trajectory. What are some potential advantages or disadvantages of this approach compared to using a continuous invariant set?

5) Proposition 1 shows robustness to disturbances and solver failures for up to M steps. How was the constant Î´ derived and what is the intuition behind its role in guaranteeing recursive feasibility?  

6) The stage cost includes terms that penalize deviation from a reference speed and change in inputs. How were these terms chosen and tuned? What effect do they have on the resulting closed-loop behavior?

7) The paper shows improved performance over standard SQP which uses early termination. However, how does the method compare to other real-time iteration schemes that provide improved feasibility guarantees?

8) What modifications would need to be made to implement the proposed method in a distributed fashion across multiple vehicles for autonomous racing?

9) A dynamic bicycle model is used to describe the vehicle dynamics. What are some limitations of this model choice and how might a higher fidelity model improve performance?

10) The method is validated on a physical system using a VICON motion capture system. What additional challenges would need to be addressed to deploy the algorithm outdoors using only on-board sensing?
