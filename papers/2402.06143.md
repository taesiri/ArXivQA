# [Reinforcement Learning for Blind Stair Climbing with Legged and   Wheeled-Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06143)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Legged and wheeled-legged robots have potential for tasks in human environments but limited capability to climb stairs, hampering functionality. Stair climbing is challenging, requiring dynamic motions to maintain balance on one leg while stepping up. Prior methods rely on precise positioning and mapping or constrained velocity tracking, lacking flexibility.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) method to develop versatile stair climbing controllers without reliance on positioning systems or exteroception. Key ideas:

- Formulate as position-based RL task rather than constrained velocity tracking, enabling more flexible gaits and motions
- Use an asymmetric actor-critic structure, leveraging privileged simulation info for training but not needing it in deployment 
- Introduce a boolean "stair mode" observation to enable specialized skills on stairs while remaining robust overall
- Apply to quadrupeds, bipeds and wheeled balancing robots with stepping reflexes when detecting stairs proprioceptively

Main Contributions:
1) RL formulation for stair climbing applicable to variety of robots - quadrupeds, bipeds, wheeled-legged
2) Learns "blind" policies not relying on exteroception, only proprioception and a terrain mode boolean  
3) Enables real wheeled bipedal robot Ascento to climb 15cm stairs, previously impossible

The approach does not require perception or positioning systems like SLAM/GPS. It uses domain randomization and a curriculum over various terrains. Experiments in simulation and real-world demonstrate stair climbing capabilities on several robots. Limitations include reliance on the terrain boolean and lack of raw perception. Future work includes inferring terrain from images or proprioception.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a reinforcement learning method to train legged and wheeled-legged robots to climb stairs using an asymmetric actor-critic setup with privileged terrain information and a boolean observation to switch between a stair climbing mode and regular locomotion mode.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting a reinforcement learning (RL) task formulation to train policies capable of climbing stairs with quadruped robots, bipedal robots, and wheeled-legged balancing robots.

2. The proposed method does not require any perceptive data or a positioning system like SLAM or GPS, making it straightforward to implement into a standard control stack. 

3. The proposed system can successfully transfer to the real world and allows the wheeled bipedal robot Ascento to climb 15cm steps, a task that was previously impossible for this robot.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing an RL-based method to enable legged and wheeled-legged robots to climb stairs robustly without relying on external positioning systems or perception during deployment. The key aspects are the task formulation, the asymmetric actor-critic setup using privileged training information, and the boolean observation for a stair climbing mode. This allows the method to be applied to real robots like Ascento and lets them perform the complex task of blind stair climbing.

The paper proposes a reinforcement learning method to train controllers for legged and wheeled-legged robots to climb stairs without reliance on positioning systems or exteroceptive sensors. It uses an asymmetric actor-critic approach with privileged terrain information and introduces a terrain mode boolean to enable specialized behaviors. The method is shown in simulation on various quadrupeds and bipeds, and allows the real wheeled bipedal robot Ascento to climb 15cm steps blindly by eliciting stepping reflexes. Key concepts include position-based control, privileged learning, blind policies, and terrain modes for sim-to-real transfer of dynamic maneuvers like stair climbing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using an asymmetric actor-critic structure for reinforcement learning. Can you explain in more detail why this structure was chosen over a standard actor-critic? What are the key advantages?

2. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several robots - quadrupeds, bipeds, and wheeled-legged robots. Can you discuss the key differences when applying the method to these various morphologies? Were any architecture or hyperparameter changes needed? 

3. The concept of a terrain boolean to switch between behaviors seems vital, especially for the bipedal robots. Can you expand more on why this is the case? Would a one-hot encoding with multiple terrain types be a potential future extension?

4. The paper argues that a position-based reinforcement learning formulation was critical for enabling the learned stair climbing behaviors. Can you contrast this with more traditional velocity-based approaches? What specifically does the position-based approach enable?

5. Domain randomization was used to aid sim-to-real transfer. Can you discuss 2-3 of the key randomizations used in this work and why they were important? 

6. The supplementary video shows that policies trained without simulating delays have stability issues in the real world. Can you analyze why this is the case and how introducing delays in simulation helped?

7. For real-world deployment, several of the observation quantities need to be estimated/reconstructed from sensor data. Can you discuss 2-3 examples and how they are obtained?

8. The paper mentions that behaviors relying solely on stepping vs using wheel grip both have disadvantages. Can you elaborate on the issues with each? How is a compromise achieved?

9. What do you think are some of the key limitations of the current method? Can you suggest 1-2 areas of future improvement or extension?

10. The method does not currently use any external perception besides the terrain boolean. Can you suggest a potential way raw sensor data could be incorporated as an extension? What challenges might this introduce?
