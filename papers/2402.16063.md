# [Citation-Enhanced Generation for LLM-based Chatbot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16063)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities but suffer from the problem of hallucination, where they generate fabricated content randomly in responses. This significantly limits their reliability and applicability in sensitive domains.

- Previous approaches to mitigate hallucinations require additional training, data annotation, or changes to the model architecture. These have limitations in flexibility and deployment. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Citation-Enhanced Generation (CEG) framework to alleviate hallucinations in a post-hoc way without extra training. 

- CEG has three key modules - retrieval augmentation, citation generation using NLI, and response regeneration.

- Given an LLM response, relevant documents are first retrieved. An NLI model then checks if citations from retrieved docs support the response segments. If no citations are found, it prompts regeneration.

Main Contributions:
- First work to utilize citation in a post-hoc way to reduce hallucinations with regeneration capacity.

- A flexible citation-enhanced generation framework augmented with retrieval and NLI that is model-agnostic.

- Experiments over multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detection and regeneration tasks.

- Further analyses provide insights into different components and hyperparameters.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in alleviating hallucinations for LLMs via a post-hoc citation-based framework with retrieval and regeneration capacity. Key advantages are model flexibility, strong empirical performance and no extra training needs.
