# [Large Language Models can Learn Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07064)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Can large language models learn explicit rules from examples that improve their reasoning abilities and reduce hallucination/errors?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new method called Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT) that allows large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to learn explicit rules from examples that can then be applied to improve reasoning performance. 

- LLMs are prone to hallucination and errors when relying solely on their implicit knowledge for reasoning tasks. The paper hypothesizes that learning explicit rules from examples can reduce these errors.

- HtT has two stages: an induction stage where the LLM generates and verifies candidate rules over training examples, and a deduction stage where the LLM is prompted to apply the learned rules to answer new questions.

- Experiments on numerical and relational reasoning tasks show HtT reduces errors and improves accuracy over regular prompting baselines by 11-27% in most cases.

So in summary, the central research question is whether LLMs can learn explicit rules from examples to improve reasoning, which the proposed HtT method aims to demonstrate. Reducing hallucination/errors is a key motivation and hypothesized benefit.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT), a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to automatically induce a rule library for reasoning tasks. 

The key ideas are:

- HtT has two stages - an induction stage and a deduction stage. 

- In the induction stage, the LLM generates and verifies rules over training examples. Frequently occurring rules that lead to correct answers are collected into a rule library. 

- In the deduction stage, the LLM is prompted to employ the learned rule library to perform reasoning and answer test questions. 

- Experiments on numerical and relational reasoning tasks show HtT improves accuracy over standard prompting methods by reducing rule hallucination.

- The learned rules are transferable to different models and problem variations.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel method to reduce hallucination and improve reasoning accuracy in LLMs by learning explicit rules from examples, instead of relying solely on implicit knowledge in the model's parameters. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated empirically.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Hypotheses-to-Theories that enables large language models to automatically induce a rule library for reasoning tasks by generating and verifying rules over training examples, then prompting the model to employ the learned rules to perform deductive reasoning when answering new questions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of training large language models:

- This paper focuses specifically on developing methods to teach large language models to learn and apply rules for reasoning tasks. This is a fairly novel approach compared to much prior work on reasoning with LLMs, which has focused more on prompting/fine-tuning the models rather than explicitly teaching them rules. 

- Most prior work on reasoning with LLMs has relied on the implicit knowledge contained within the model's parameters. In contrast, this paper proposes an explicit process of rule induction followed by deductive application of those rules. This is more similar to classical AI methods of knowledge representation and reasoning.

- The idea of prompting LLMs to generate and verify hypotheses before collecting them into a knowledge base is unique. It draws inspiration from the scientific method of developing theories through repeated hypothesis generation and testing. I'm not aware of other works that have taken this approach with LLMs.

- The two-stage prompting framework of hypothesis generation then theory application is a novel way to inject more inductive bias into LLMs. The experiments show this outperforms standard prompting approaches that rely solely on an LLM's existing knowledge.

- The focus on numerical and relational reasoning tasks is common in recent research on LLMs. However, the level of complexity handled in the Arithmetic and CLUTRR datasets seems more advanced than some prior reasoning tasks.

- The comparisons to restricted models like EdgeTransformer provide useful context on how close prompting gets LLMs to matching specialized reasoning systems. But the transfer learning results demonstrate benefits of the prompting approach.

Overall, this paper introduces a unique inductive prompting framework that diverges from prior reliance on implicit LLM knowledge for reasoning. The emphasis on testing the approach on complex reasoning tasks also pushes forward the capabilities demonstrated on benchmark datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing techniques to scale up deductive reasoning when the rule library cannot fit into the LLM's input context. The paper notes that the number of rules is currently limited by the LLM's context length, so finding ways to expand the context capacity or decompose the reasoning process could allow for more complex rule libraries.

- Improving the retrieval ability of LLMs for deductive reasoning. The paper suggests finetuning LLMs on retrieval tasks/datasets could enhance their ability to select the right rules during deduction.

- Learning more complete rule libraries to reduce missing rules. The analysis shows some errors occur because the required rule is not present in the induced library, so expanding the coverage of rules learned during induction could help.

- Reducing biases in the LLM's parametric knowledge that lead to biased rules. The ethics statement notes that biases in the pretraining data can lead to biased induced rules, so work on aligning LLMs with human values could address this.

- Applying the approach to new domains and tasks beyond the numerical/relational reasoning tasks explored. The paper demonstrates it on arithmetic and kinship reasoning but suggests it may be useful for broader reasoning applications.

- Developing inductive biases and evaluating inductiveness for neural deductive reasoners. While not a main focus, the paper suggests studying inductive abilities and generalization in reasoning models.

- Using the approach for knowledge distillation to transfer reasoning skills from powerful to weaker LLMs. The results hint at a potential for the learned rules to teach reasoning skills.

So in summary, scaling deduction, improving retrieval, expanding rule coverage, reducing bias, applying to new domains, developing inductive biases, and knowledge distillation are highlighted as interesting future directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT), a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to automatically induce a rule library for reasoning tasks. HtT contains two stages - an induction stage and a deduction stage. In the induction stage, an LLM is asked to generate and verify rules over training examples. Rules that appear frequently and lead to correct answers are collected into a rule library. In the deduction stage, the LLM is prompted to employ the learned rule library to perform reasoning and answer test questions. Experiments on numerical and relational reasoning datasets show that HtT improves existing prompting methods like chain-of-thought, reducing errors caused by incorrect rules. The learned rules are also shown to transfer between models and problem formats. Overall, the paper demonstrates that explicitly inducing and applying rules with LLMs can reduce hallucination and improve performance on reasoning tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT), a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to learn explicit rules for reasoning tasks. HtT has two stages - an induction stage and a deduction stage. In the induction stage, the LLM is prompted to generate and verify hypothesized rules over training examples. Rules that appear frequently and lead to correct answers are collected into a rule library. In the deduction stage, the LLM is prompted to retrieve and apply rules from the learned library to answer new questions. 

Experiments are conducted with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on numerical and relational reasoning tasks. Results show that HtT improves accuracy over regular prompting methods by 11-27% in most cases. The learned rules also transfer well to new models and textual versions of the same task. Ablation studies indicate HtT reduces rule hallucination and benefits from the XML tagging trick for rule retrieval. Overall, HtT demonstrates that explicitly inducing and applying rules is an effective strategy for improving reasoning and reducing hallucination in LLMs. The method opens opportunities for acquiring structured knowledge with LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT) to learn explicit rules and apply them for reasoning with large language models (LLMs). HtT contains two stages - an induction stage and a deduction stage. In the induction stage, the LLM is prompted to generate and verify candidate rules over a set of training examples. Rules that appear frequently and lead to correct answers are collected into a rule library. In the deduction stage, the LLM is prompted to retrieve and apply rules from the learned rule library to perform multi-step reasoning and answer new questions. Through experiments on arithmetic and relational reasoning tasks, the paper shows that augmenting existing prompting methods like chain-of-thought with the HtT framework improves reasoning accuracy and reduces rule hallucination errors.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the main problem the authors are trying to address is the issue of large language models tending to hallucinate or generate incorrect outputs that seem plausible but contradict real world knowledge. 

Specifically, the paper notes that when using prompting techniques to get LLMs to perform reasoning tasks, the models will often rely on incorrect implicit knowledge or rules resulting in incorrect answers. This is especially problematic in reasoning tasks that involve unconventional or counterfactual scenarios that differ from the pretraining data.

To address this issue, the paper proposes a framework called Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT) that aims to learn explicit rule libraries to reduce hallucination and improve reasoning performance. The key ideas are:

1) Use the LLM to generate and verify hypotheses (rules) over training examples during an induction stage. This results in a verified rule library. 

2) In the deduction stage, provide the learned rule library to the LLM and have it explicitly retrieve and apply rules to answer test questions, rather than rely solely on implicit knowledge.

So in summary, the main problem is reducing hallucination and incorrect reasoning in LLMs, and the proposed solution is to induce explicit verified rule libraries that the LLM can apply during deduction. This aims to improve reasoning performance particularly in counterfactual scenarios that differ from the LLM's pretraining.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage framework of hypothesis generation followed by theory formation. What are the key advantages and potential limitations of separating these two stages? Could an end-to-end approach that jointly learns hypotheses and theories be more effective?

2. The rule induction process relies on prompting the LLM to generate and verify rules on training examples. However, the LLM may fail to generate some valid rules due to imperfect prompting or limitations of its knowledge. How can the rule induction process be made more thorough to discover a more complete set of valid rules? 

3. The paper filters rules based on frequency and accuracy on the training set. How sensitive is the performance to the choice of frequency and accuracy thresholds? Is there a principled way to set these thresholds optimally for a given dataset?

4. The deduction stage relies on the LLM's ability to retrieve the correct rule from the induced rule set. However, retrieval seems to be a major bottleneck. How can the LLM's retrieval skills for rules be improved? Are there other deduction frameworks besides retrieval that could work better?

5. The paper evaluates the approach on numerical and relational reasoning tasks. How do you expect the approach to perform on other types of reasoning tasks such as logical, commonsense or causal reasoning? Would the hypothesis-theory framework transfer well or would it need to be adapted?

6. The rule induction process depends heavily on the quality of the training data. How robust is the approach when the training data contains noise, outliers or adversarially manipulated examples?

7. The paper induces explicit symbolic rules, separate from the LLM's parameters. What are the tradeoffs between learning explicit rules versus implicitly encoding the knowledge in the LLM's parameters? When is each approach more suitable?

8. The paper focuses on improving sample efficiency via rule induction. Could the induced rules also help improve computational efficiency during inference? E.g., by pruning the search space via retrieved rules.

9. The paper evaluates the approach on single-step reasoning tasks. How can the framework be extended to multi-step or recursive reasoning tasks that require chaining rules? Does the LLM have a sufficiently strong inductive bias for chaining induced rules?

10. The paper induces rules to avoid hallucination errors. However, rules learned from imperfect training data could also potentially introduce new types of errors. Does relying on learned rules trade one source of errors (hallucination) for another (rule overgeneralization)? How can this tradeoff be managed?
