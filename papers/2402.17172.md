# [Lane2Seq: Towards Unified Lane Detection via Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing lane detection methods rely on specialized network architectures with task-specific components like classification/regression heads and loss functions. This leads to complex and inefficient models. The paper proposes to formulate lane detection as a sequence generation problem to unify different output formats like segmentation, anchors, and parameters.

Solution - Lane2Seq:
- The paper presents Lane2Seq, a sequence generation framework for lane detection. It converts various output formats into sequences of tokens that are generated auto-regressively by a transformer encoder-decoder. 
- Lane2Seq only uses a simple cross-entropy loss without any task-specific losses. The output format is specified by a prompt token in the input sequence.
- To incorporate task knowledge without changing the architecture, a novel multi-format model tuning method based on reinforcement learning (MFRL) is proposed. MFRL uses metrics like F1 as reward to fine-tune the model with REINFORCE.
- Format-specific reward functions are designed leveraging knowledge like lane angles, false positives etc. Segmentation uses IOU and line IOU as rewards, anchor uses distance and line IOU while parameter uses only line IOU.

Main Contributions:
- First sequence generation framework for unifying lane detection formats through auto-regressive generation.
- Reinforcement learning based multi-format tuning to inject task knowledge without architecture changes.
- Competitive or state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets while using a simple transformer and cross-entropy loss only.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to formulate diverse lane detection formats through sequence generation, eliminating the need for specialized model components. The simple yet effective Lane2Seq framework with reinforcement learning based tuning achieves excellent performance across formats and datasets.
