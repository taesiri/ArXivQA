# [Few Shots Are All You Need: A Progressive Few Shot Learning Approach for   Low Resource Handwritten Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10064)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop a handwritten text recognition system that requires minimal human effort for labeling training data, while still achieving good performance on low-resource historical manuscripts?The key points are:- Handwritten text recognition (HTR) typically requires large labeled training sets, which is problematic for low-resource manuscripts.- The authors propose a few-shot learning approach that only requires labeling a few examples per symbol class rather than full text lines. - To further reduce human effort, they introduce an unsupervised progressive pseudo-labeling method to automatically annotate unlabeled training data.- Experiments on enciphered manuscripts and Codex Runicus show they can achieve performance close to using manual labels, while greatly reducing human annotation effort.So in summary, the main research goal is reducing human labeling effort for low-resource HTR through few-shot learning and automatic pseudo-labeling, while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A few-shot learning model for transcribing manuscripts in low resource scenarios that requires minimal human effort - only 5 examples of each symbol in the alphabet need to be labeled instead of entire text lines.2. An unsupervised, segmentation-free method to progressively obtain pseudo-labeled training data from unlabeled cursive handwritten texts.3. A generic recognition and pseudo-labeling model that can work across different scripts and alphabets. 4. Extensive experiments on different datasets (enciphered manuscripts and Codex Runicus) that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show performance close to using manually labeled data but with significantly reduced human effort.5. Analysis of the annotation time savings using the proposed pseudo-labeling approach compared to manual labeling. Providing 5 examples per symbol takes just minutes whereas manually annotating entire text lines can take hours.In summary, the key contribution is a semi-supervised approach that enables training an HTR system in low resource scenarios with minimal human effort by automatically generating pseudo-labels. This allows achieving good performance without the need for exhaustive manual labeling of training data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a few-shot learning approach for low resource handwriting recognition that uses unsupervised progressive pseudo-labeling to significantly reduce manual annotation effort while maintaining good performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in low resource handwritten text recognition:- The paper focuses specifically on recognizing text in historical manuscripts and ciphers that use rare or invented alphabets. This is an important but lesser studied problem compared to recognizing more common scripts like Latin alphabets.- The proposed method is a few-shot learning approach that requires very minimal labeled data (just 1-5 examples of each symbol). This sets it apart from supervised methods that require large labeled datasets. It reduces annotation effort compared to prior few-shot methods.- The paper introduces a progressive pseudo-labeling technique to automatically generate labels for unlabeled data. This allows the model to be trained in a semi-supervised manner while avoiding costly manual annotation. Pseudo-labeling has not been widely explored for cursive handwriting recognition.- Experiments are conducted on multiple cipher and historical datasets. Many prior works focused on only one type of data. Testing on multiple domains shows the versatility of the approach.- Results are competitive with prior supervised methods that use full manual labeling. The pseudo-labeling approach achieves similar performance to manual labeling but with significantly lower human effort. This demonstrates its practical usefulness.- Unlike some prior works, the proposed method works at line level and does not require explicit segmentation of symbols. This makes it more suitable for cursive scripts where symbols connect.Overall, the pseudo-labeling few-shot learning approach appears to advance the state-of-the-art for low resource handwriting recognition. The reductions in annotation effort while maintaining accuracy are noteworthy contributions to this niche problem domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Enhancing the quality of the provided pseudo-labels to further reduce the need for manual intervention. The authors note that improving the pseudo-labeling process could help minimize the human effort even more.- Extending the approach to work at paragraph or page level instead of just line level. The current method operates on individual text lines, but expanding it to handle larger blocks of text could be beneficial.- Applying the method to more low resource scripts and languages beyond just the historical cipher and runic manuscripts tested in the paper. The approach may generalize well to other scarce handwritten data.- Using the pseudo-labeling approach to train standard HTR models on common scripts that still have limited labeled data. Rather than few-shot learning, the pseudo-labels could potentially boost regular supervised HTR training.- Exploring the use of semi-supervised learning by starting with a small set of manually labeled real data before progressing to pseudo-labeling. The paper briefly tests this but suggests more work could be done.- Investigating modifications and extensions to the few-shot model itself, such as integrating ideas from other few-shot and semi-supervised methods.Overall, the authors recommend further research into refining the pseudo-labeling process, expanding the applicability of the approach to new domains and language scripts, and integrating it with other learning paradigms like semi-supervised learning. More advanced few-shot modeling techniques could also be worthwhile to explore.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a few-shot learning based approach for handwritten text recognition that requires minimal human effort for annotation. The method uses a few example images of each symbol in the target alphabet as input. First, the model is pretrained on synthetic text lines made of Omniglot symbols. Then, it is fine-tuned on synthetic lines made by concatenating the few example symbol images of the target alphabet. To avoid manually annotating real text lines for fine-tuning, the authors propose an unsupervised progressive pseudo-labeling method. It automatically assigns labels and bounding boxes to unlabeled real text lines by selecting high-confidence predictions iteratively. Experiments on enciphered manuscripts and Codex Runicus show this approach achieves good performance comparable to using manually annotated data, while only requiring a few example images per symbol as annotation. The main contributions are: (i) a few-shot learning model for handwriting recognition with minimal human labeling effort, (ii) an unsupervised segmentation-free pseudo-labeling approach, (iii) a generic recognition and pseudo-labeling model applicable across scripts, (iv) demonstrated effectiveness on different manuscript datasets.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a few-shot learning-based handwriting recognition approach that significantly reduces the human labor annotation process for low resource scenarios, requiring only few images of each alphabet symbol instead of labeling entire text lines. The method consists of detecting all the symbols of a given alphabet in a textline image and decoding the obtained similarity scores to the final sequence of transcribed symbols. The model is first pretrained on synthetic line images generated from any alphabet, even different from the target domain. A second training step is then applied to diminish the gap between the source and target data. Since this retraining would require annotating thousands of handwritten symbols with their bounding boxes, the authors propose an unsupervised progressive learning approach that automatically assigns pseudo-labels to the non-annotated data, avoiding manual effort. Experiments on different manuscript datasets show the model can reach performance similar to using manually labeled data with significant reduction in human effort. Only 5 examples of each symbol are needed compared to annotating full text lines.In summary, this paper tackles the problem of handwritten text recognition in low resource scenarios like rare or invented alphabets in historical manuscripts. A few-shot learning model is proposed that only requires a few examples of each symbol rather than full annotated text lines. An unsupervised progressive pseudo-labeling method is introduced to automatically annotate data for model retraining instead of manual labeling effort. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, reaching similar performance to supervised methods but with much less human annotation effort. The key contributions are reducing manual effort in low resource handwriting recognition while maintaining accuracy.
