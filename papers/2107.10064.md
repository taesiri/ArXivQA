# [Few Shots Are All You Need: A Progressive Few Shot Learning Approach for   Low Resource Handwritten Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10064)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop a handwritten text recognition system that requires minimal human effort for labeling training data, while still achieving good performance on low-resource historical manuscripts?The key points are:- Handwritten text recognition (HTR) typically requires large labeled training sets, which is problematic for low-resource manuscripts.- The authors propose a few-shot learning approach that only requires labeling a few examples per symbol class rather than full text lines. - To further reduce human effort, they introduce an unsupervised progressive pseudo-labeling method to automatically annotate unlabeled training data.- Experiments on enciphered manuscripts and Codex Runicus show they can achieve performance close to using manual labels, while greatly reducing human annotation effort.So in summary, the main research goal is reducing human labeling effort for low-resource HTR through few-shot learning and automatic pseudo-labeling, while maintaining accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A few-shot learning model for transcribing manuscripts in low resource scenarios that requires minimal human effort - only 5 examples of each symbol in the alphabet need to be labeled instead of entire text lines.2. An unsupervised, segmentation-free method to progressively obtain pseudo-labeled training data from unlabeled cursive handwritten texts.3. A generic recognition and pseudo-labeling model that can work across different scripts and alphabets. 4. Extensive experiments on different datasets (enciphered manuscripts and Codex Runicus) that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show performance close to using manually labeled data but with significantly reduced human effort.5. Analysis of the annotation time savings using the proposed pseudo-labeling approach compared to manual labeling. Providing 5 examples per symbol takes just minutes whereas manually annotating entire text lines can take hours.In summary, the key contribution is a semi-supervised approach that enables training an HTR system in low resource scenarios with minimal human effort by automatically generating pseudo-labels. This allows achieving good performance without the need for exhaustive manual labeling of training data.
