# [Spatial features of CO2 for occupancy detection in a naturally   ventilated school building](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06643)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate occupancy detection is important for building energy efficiency and occupant comfort. CO2-based occupancy detection methods have gained attention due to low cost and non-invasiveness, but their performance is generally low in naturally ventilated buildings. This is due to the complex ventilation behavior and difficulty in measuring actual air exchange rate through windows. The spatial distribution of CO2 also affects detection accuracy based on sensor location.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two novel features derived from the spatial CO2 distribution to enhance occupancy detection in naturally ventilated rooms:

1. Vertical difference of CO2 concentration (VD): Captures the vertical CO2 gradient phenomenon caused by thermal plumes. 

2. Horizontal difference (HD): Represents CO2 changes due to ventilation proximity to windows.  

These spatial features are combined with temporal CO2 features like average (AVG) and first-order difference (FD). Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used for evaluation.

Main Contributions:

- Spatial CO2 features substantially enhance occupancy state detection accuracy by up to 14.8 percentage points, reaching 83.2% (F1 score 0.84) without ventilation data. With ventilation data, accuracy reaches 87.6%.

- Spatial features significantly improve occupancy quantity detection by up to 25.3 percentage points versus baseline. Best performance reaches 56% accuracy and RMSE of 11.44 occupants using only CO2 features.  

- The model using only CO2 features and spatial distribution performs similarly to the model with additional ventilation data. This enables better low-cost occupancy detection in naturally ventilated buildings.

- Analysis provides reference to guide adoption of different sensor options/positions based on budget constraints and required accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces novel spatial features of indoor CO2 distribution to enhance occupancy detection performance in naturally ventilated buildings, achieving up to 87.6% accuracy for state detection and RMSE of 9.02 occupants for quantity detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing novel spatial features based on the vertical gradient phenomenon of CO2 concentration. These spatial features are shown to substantially enhance the performance of CO2-based occupancy detection in naturally ventilated buildings. Specifically, by incorporating spatial features like the vertical and horizontal difference of CO2 levels, the accuracy for detecting occupancy state improved by up to 14.8 percentage points and the accuracy for detecting occupancy quantity improved by up to 25.3 percentage points compared to using only temporal CO2 features. The paper demonstrates the potential of leveraging spatial CO2 distribution to improve occupancy detection in a cost-effective manner.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces two novel features - vertical difference (VD) and horizontal difference (HD) of CO2 concentration - to improve occupancy detection. Can you explain in more detail how these features are derived and what physical phenomena they aim to capture? 

2. One of the key findings is that adding the VD feature improves state detection accuracy by about 11 percentage points over using just temporal CO2 features. What are some possible reasons why VD contains useful occupancy information not captured by temporal patterns?

3. The paper evaluates state and quantity detection separately. What are the key differences in how well spatial vs temporal features perform for these two tasks? What might explain these differences?

4. For quantity detection, accuracy only improves modestly with the addition of spatial features. The paper mentions potential ways to further improve performance - can you discuss some of these in more detail? What are some pros and cons?

5. The data comes from classrooms in a school with natural ventilation. How might the performance of spatial vs temporal features differ in buildings with mechanical ventilation? What are some ways the methodology could be adapted?   

6. The paper uses a questionnaire to collect ground truth occupancy data. What are some limitations of this approach? If you were to repeat this study, what alternative ways could you collect ground truth data?

7. SVM is used as the machine learning algorithm. What are some pros and cons of SVM for this application? What other classes of algorithms would you consider instead?

8. The model is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score and RMSE. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each metric for this problem? Are there any other evaluation metrics you would consider?

9. The paper evaluates performance using a train-test split methodology. What are some limitations of this approach compared to alternatives like cross-validation?

10. The methodology is evaluated on data from 3 classrooms. What additional analyses would you conduct to further validate the robustness of using spatial CO2 features for occupancy detection?
