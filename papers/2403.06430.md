# [AS-FIBA: Adaptive Selective Frequency-Injection for Backdoor Attack on   Deep Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep learning-based face restoration models are increasingly used in smart devices to enhance facial image quality. However, these models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where malicious triggers can be injected into input images to cause unexpected restoration outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks focus on classification tasks and use conspicuous attack targets, making them easy to detect. There is a need for stealthy yet effective backdoor attacks tailored for face restoration models.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new backdoor attack framework called AS-FIBA:

1) Introduces a unique degradation objective specifically designed for attacking restoration models. Instead of fixed/conspicuous targets, it subtly guides the model to output slightly more degraded images under attack. This ensures stealthiness. 

2) Develops a Selective Frequency Injection Network (SF-I-Net) which adaptively injects trigger information from a trigger image into benign input images. This is done by fusing low/high frequency components from the trigger image into the benign image's frequency domain representation. The adaptive injection based on input image ensures imperceptibility.

3) Employs a residual decoder network during SF-I-Net training to enforce that the poisoned image retains all trigger information while being indistinguishable from benign image. This makes the attack robust.

4) Uses pseudo triggers during model training to enhance specificity of the backdoor to a chosen trigger image.

Main Contributions:

1) First backdoor attack framework tailored for deep face restoration models with a unique degradation attack objective.

2) SF-I-Net enables adaptive and selective frequency-domain injection of triggers for enhanced stealthiness and efficacy.

3) Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art face restoration models demonstrate superiority of the proposed AS-FIBA attack over existing backdoor attacks like WaNet, ISSBA and FIBA interms of stealthiness and attack success rate.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in understanding and enhancing robustness of face restoration models against sophisticated backdoor attacks using adaptive frequency-domain trigger injection.
