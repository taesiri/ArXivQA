# [AS-FIBA: Adaptive Selective Frequency-Injection for Backdoor Attack on   Deep Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep learning-based face restoration models are increasingly used in smart devices to enhance facial image quality. However, these models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where malicious triggers can be injected into input images to cause unexpected restoration outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks focus on classification tasks and use conspicuous attack targets, making them easy to detect. There is a need for stealthy yet effective backdoor attacks tailored for face restoration models.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new backdoor attack framework called AS-FIBA:

1) Introduces a unique degradation objective specifically designed for attacking restoration models. Instead of fixed/conspicuous targets, it subtly guides the model to output slightly more degraded images under attack. This ensures stealthiness. 

2) Develops a Selective Frequency Injection Network (SF-I-Net) which adaptively injects trigger information from a trigger image into benign input images. This is done by fusing low/high frequency components from the trigger image into the benign image's frequency domain representation. The adaptive injection based on input image ensures imperceptibility.

3) Employs a residual decoder network during SF-I-Net training to enforce that the poisoned image retains all trigger information while being indistinguishable from benign image. This makes the attack robust.

4) Uses pseudo triggers during model training to enhance specificity of the backdoor to a chosen trigger image.

Main Contributions:

1) First backdoor attack framework tailored for deep face restoration models with a unique degradation attack objective.

2) SF-I-Net enables adaptive and selective frequency-domain injection of triggers for enhanced stealthiness and efficacy.

3) Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art face restoration models demonstrate superiority of the proposed AS-FIBA attack over existing backdoor attacks like WaNet, ISSBA and FIBA interms of stealthiness and attack success rate.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in understanding and enhancing robustness of face restoration models against sophisticated backdoor attacks using adaptive frequency-domain trigger injection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a stealthy backdoor attack framework (AS-FIBA) for face restoration models, which uses a degradation attack objective and an input-adaptive frequency injection method to subtly manipulate restored face images under attack conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a novel degradation objective specifically tailored for backdoor attacks on face restoration models. This allows the attack to subtly alter the outputs under attack conditions while preserving stealthiness and minimizing detection. 

2) It presents the Adaptive Selective Frequency Injection Backdoor Attack (AS-FIBA) framework, which uses a neural network to generate input-specific triggers in the frequency domain. This allows the triggers to be seamlessly blended into benign images, ensuring imperceptibility while still being effective at compromising the restoration process.

3) It provides comprehensive experimental evaluations assessing the efficacy and stealthiness of the AS-FIBA framework against various state-of-the-art face restoration models using different backdoor attacks. The experiments demonstrate AS-FIBA's superior performance in conducting imperceptible yet impactful backdoor attacks.

In summary, the key innovation presented is the AS-FIBA framework and its adaptive frequency manipulation approach for generating input-specific backdoor triggers that can effectively attack state-of-the-art face restoration models in a highly stealthy manner.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an "Adaptive Selective Frequency Injection Backdoor Attack (AS-FIBA)". Can you explain in detail how the adaptive frequency injection process works and what makes it more effective than prior frequency injection approaches? 

2. The Selective Frequency-Injection Network (SF-I-Net) is a core component of AS-FIBA. Can you walk through the architecture and key modules of SF-I-Net, explaining how it conducts trigger generation and injection?

3. Compared to existing backdoor attacks like WaNet, ISSBA and FIBA, what specifically makes AS-FIBA more stealthy and imperceptible in attacking face restoration models? Explain the differences.  

4. The paper introduces a unique "degradation objective" for attacking face restoration models. Why is this degradation objective better suited for this task compared to traditional fixed or conspicuous attack targets?

5. Can you explain the rationale behind using pseudo triggers during the robust backdoor training? How exactly does this enhance the backdoor's resilience and specificity?

6. In the frequency injection analysis, the paper shows AS-FIBA also predominantly injects trigger information into the lower frequencies similar to FIBA. Why is low frequency injection more stealthy?

7. The paper evaluates AS-FIBA across multiple face restoration models. Based on the results, which model seems most and least susceptible to the attack? What inferences can be drawn about their robustness?

8. How exactly does the paper evaluate attack efficacy for face restoration models in the absence of reference ground truths? Explain the adapted metrics used.  

9. What were the key observations from the Fine-Pruning and STRIP defense experiments? What do they suggest about detecting frequency-based backdoors?

10. The Grad-CAM analysis reveals similarity between clean and poisoned activations for FIBA and AS-FIBA. Why is this the case? How does it relate to frequency-based triggers?
