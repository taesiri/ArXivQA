# [LS-Tree: Model Interpretation When the Data Are Linguistic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04187)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to interpret trained classification models for linguistic data in a way that leverages the syntactic structure and compositionality of language. The key hypotheses are:1) Syntactic constituency structure, as represented by parse trees, can be used to assign importance scores to words that capture their contribution to a model's predictions.2) These importance scores can be used to detect and quantify interactions between words based on their relationships in the parse tree structure. 3) Analyzing these interactions provides insights into properties of the model, such as its nonlinearity and ability to capture linguistic phenomena like adversative relations.4) Statistics of the interaction scores can serve as diagnostics for overfitting in model training.The overall goal is to develop model-agnostic interpretation methods tailored for linguistic data that provide explanatory power beyond what current generic feature attribution techniques can offer. The parse tree-based scoring scheme and interaction detection algorithm are proposed as concrete realizations of this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing the LS-Tree value, a method to assign importance scores to words in a sentence by leveraging its syntactic structure represented as a constituency parse tree. The scores are obtained by fitting a linear model to approximate the prediction function on word subsets corresponding to the nodes of the parse tree.- Relating the LS-Tree value to the Banzhaf value from coalitional game theory. This provides an axiomatic characterization and justification for the proposed method. - Developing an algorithm based on the LS-Tree value to detect and quantify interactions between words, specifically sibling nodes in the parse tree, using Cook's distance.- Demonstrating the utility of the LS-Tree value and interaction scores for analyzing several aspects of NLP models: quantifying nonlinearity, assessing ability to capture adversative relations, and detecting overfitting.- Conducting experiments on four models (BoW, CNN, LSTM, BERT) over three sentiment analysis datasets to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed techniques.In summary, the key contribution is a novel model-agnostic method for interpreting NLP models by assigning importance scores to words in a principled way using syntactic structure, along with an algorithm to quantify interactions that can provide insights into model behavior. Theoretical connections and experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called LS-Tree to interpret trained classification models on linguistic data by assigning importance scores to words using syntactic constituency structure and relating the method to concepts in coalitional game theory; the importance scores are then used to detect interactions between words captured by the model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on interpreting machine learning models for natural language processing:- The paper focuses specifically on interpreting trained classification models for linguistic data represented as parse trees. Many other interpretation methods are more general and do not leverage this syntactic structure.- The proposed LS-Tree value provides instance-wise importance scores for words that respect the constituency structure of the parse tree. This connects model interpretation to concepts like the Banzhaf value from cooperative game theory. Other methods like LIME and SHAP do not have this kind of theoretical grounding.- The paper introduces a novel algorithm for detecting interactions between words based on the LS-Tree scores. This provides a principled way to quantify compositionality that is not found in other interpretation methods. - The approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to any classification model, including neural networks like CNNs and LSTMs. Some other interpretation methods are designed for specific model classes.- The experiments demonstrate how the LS-Tree approach can analyze model properties like nonlinearity, handling of adversative relations, and overfitting. Many papers on interpretation methods do not go into this level of analysis.- The approach does rely on having a constituency parse tree as input, whereas other methods work directly from raw text. This could limit applicability in some cases.Overall, the LS-Tree method makes useful connections between compositionality in language, coalition game theory, and model interpretation. The analysis enabled by the interaction scores is a unique contribution. But the reliance on parse trees and focus on classification may limit wider adoption compared to more broadly applicable methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing methods to quantify higher-order interactions beyond pairwise interactions between words. The current approach focuses on sibling interactions in a parse tree, which captures pairwise interactions. Extending this to model higher-order interactions could provide a more complete picture of compositionality. - Applying the interaction detection method to study other aspects of NLP models, beyond what was demonstrated in the experiments. For example, using it to analyze the effect of linguistic structure, role of pretraining, influence of different architectural choices, etc.- Leveraging other types of syntactic/semantic structure beyond constituency parse trees, such as dependency parses, to guide the model interpretation process. - Extending the framework to other modalities beyond text, such as images, audio, and multimodal data. The general principles could potentially carry over.- Further theoretical analysis of the connection to coalitional game theory. The paper establishes one theorem relating the LS-Tree value to the Banzhaf value, but further exploration of this link could be illuminating.- Modifying the model training process to enhance interpretability, instead of just post-hoc interpretation. For example, by incorporating interpretability metrics like the LS-Tree value directly into the objective function.- Validating the effectiveness of the overfitting diagnostic on a broader range of models and data sets. More investigation into why interaction variance differs between training and test sets for overfitted models.- Developing visualization tools and case studies to provide more qualitative analysis of model interpretations beyond quantitative metrics.So in summary, the authors point to several interesting avenues for better understanding model interpretability through syntactic interactions, strengthening the theoretical grounding, and applying the approach to improve model training and diagnosis.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes the LS-Tree value, a method to assign importance scores to words in a sentence by leveraging its syntactic constituency structure represented by a parse tree. The LS-Tree value is derived by minimizing the sum-of-squared residuals of the model predictions on all nodes of the parse tree. It is related to the Banzhaf value from coalitional game theory and satisfies certain desired axiomatic properties. Based on the LS-Tree scores, an algorithm is developed to quantify interactions between words, specifically between siblings in the parse tree. Experiments demonstrate how these importance and interaction scores can be used for model interpretation and diagnostics. The nonlinearity and ability to capture adversative relations is analyzed for several NLP models. Also, a permutation test using the interaction scores is shown to detect overfitting. Overall, the LS-Tree framework provides a principled way to interpret NLP models using the syntactic structure of language.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method called LS-Tree for interpreting trained classification models on linguistic data. The method assigns importance scores to each word in a sentence by using a parse tree to capture syntactic structure. It solves a least squares problem to find the best linear approximation to the model's output on all subsets of words corresponding to nodes in the parse tree. The coefficients of this linear function give the word importance scores. The authors relate this method to concepts in coalitional game theory like the Banzhaf value. Based on the LS-Tree scores, the paper also introduces an algorithm to detect interactions between words using the idea of Cook's distance. Experiments are presented applying these methods to analyze several NLP models, including assessing nonlinearity, modeling of adversative words, and detecting overfitting. The LS-Tree framework provides a novel way to quantify word importances and interactions in a model-agnostic manner while incorporating syntactic structure. The experiments demonstrate how the approach can be used for model analysis and debugging in NLP.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes the LS-Tree value, a method to assign importance scores to words in a sentence by leveraging its syntactic structure represented as a constituency-based parse tree. For a given sentence, the LS-Tree value minimizes the sum of squared residuals between the model's evaluations on word subsets corresponding to nodes in the parse tree and their best linear approximation. The optimal coefficients of this linear approximation are taken as the word importance scores. The LS-Tree value is related to the Banzhaf value from cooperative game theory. Based on the LS-Tree scores, an algorithm is developed to quantify interactions between sibling nodes in the parse tree using Cook's distance, indicating deviation from linearity. Experiments apply the proposed methods to analyze nonlinearity, ability to capture adversative relations, and overfitting tendencies in several NLP models including CNN, LSTM and BERT.
