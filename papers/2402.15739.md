# [Low-Rank Bandits via Tight Two-to-Infinity Singular Subspace Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15739)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies stochastic bandit problems with low-rank structure. Specifically, the expected rewards are modeled by a low rank matrix M in R^{m×n}. In each round, a context i is randomly selected from [m], the learner chooses an arm j from [n], and observes a noisy reward corresponding to entry M_{i,j}. The goal is to efficiently learn in this setting, for three key tasks - policy evaluation, best policy identification, and regret minimization. 

Proposed Solution:
The main insight is a two-phase approach - first leverage spectral methods to estimate the singular subspaces of M. This allows transforming the problem into an instance of misspecified contextual linear bandits with dimension roughly r(m+n). In the second phase, algorithms from this simpler setting can be adapted. 

For policy evaluation, two algorithms are proposed - DSM-PE directly estimates M while RS-PE refines this estimate by solving the misspecified linear bandit via least squares. For best policy identification, DSM-BPI and RS-BPI similarly use either the direct estimate of M or the refined estimate. For regret minimization, RS-RMIN uses an extension of SupLinUCB to solve the transformed problem.

Main Contributions:

1) The paper provides the first policy evaluation and best policy ID algorithms for low rank bandits that are nearly minimax optimal in terms of dependence on key parameters like m, n, ε.

2) For regret minimization, RS-RMIN is the first algorithm that provably exploits low rank structure to get better bounds than standard bandits (regret scales as (m+n)^{3/4}√T vs previous best of √mnT).

3) The analysis crucially leverages a novel bound on subspace recovery error in the two-to-infinity norm under limited independence. This allows an accurate reduction to misspecified linear bandits.

4) Experiments validate the significant gains of the proposed methods over baselines. RS-PE substantially outperforms prior methods for policy evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes new algorithms for policy evaluation, best policy identification, and regret minimization in contextual bandits with low-rank reward structure by first recovering the reward matrix singular subspaces in the two-to-infinity norm, then reducing the problems to misspecified linear bandits to exploit tighter error bounds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing efficient algorithms for policy evaluation, best policy identification, and regret minimization in contextual bandits with low-rank reward structure. Specifically:

1) For policy evaluation and best policy identification, the paper presents algorithms called RS-PE and RS-BPI that leverage spectral methods to estimate the singular subspaces of the reward matrix and then reduce the problem to a misspecified linear bandit. These algorithms achieve nearly minimax optimal sample complexity. 

2) For regret minimization, the paper proposes an algorithm called RS-RMIN that also uses a two-phase approach - first estimating the singular subspaces and then solving a misspecified linear bandit. This algorithm achieves an improved regret bound compared to prior work, scaling as Õ((m+n)^{3/4}√T) which is better than the Õ(√mnT) bound for unstructured bandits. 

3) The key insight enabling these results is establishing tight subspace recovery guarantees in the "two-to-infinity norm", which allows reformulating the low-rank bandit as a misspecified linear bandit with controlled misspecification. This two-phase design principle based on tight subspace recovery is the main contribution.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing efficient and nearly optimal algorithms for various learning tasks in low-rank bandits, enabled by tight subspace recovery guarantees and a two-phase algorithm design approach.

The paper focuses on stochastic bandit problems with low-rank structure in the reward matrix. It proposes efficient two-phase algorithms for policy evaluation, best policy identification, and regret minimization that achieve nearly minimax optimal performance. A key component is recovering tight error bounds for singular subspace recovery using entrywise norm analysis. This enables reduction to misspecified linear bandits while controlling the misspecification. The paper also derives instance-dependent lower bounds that match the performance of the proposed algorithms.
