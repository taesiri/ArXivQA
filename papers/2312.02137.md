# [MANUS: Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D   Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02137)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurately modeling hand-object contacts during grasps is very challenging but critical for applications in robotics and VR/AR. Existing methods use simplistic representations like skeletons or meshes which fail to accurately model contacts due to misalignments. Recently proposed articulated neural implicit representations are also inefficient at contact modeling and require expensive sampling. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes MANUS - a novel grasp capture method using articulated 3D Gaussians. Key ideas:

1) Introduce MANUS-Hand - an articulated hand model based on 3D Gaussian splatting. Compared to implicit networks, Gaussians enable efficient training and contact inference. 

2) Propose method to combine MANUS-Hand with 3D Gaussian object model to capture grasps and estimate instantaneous + accumulated contacts using Gaussian proximities.

3) Present MANUS-Grasps, a large real dataset with 7M frames from 53 cameras capturing 400+ grasps. Uses paint transfer for contact ground truth.

Main Contributions:

1) MANUS-Hand: Efficient articulated 3D Gaussian hand model for accurate shape/appearance

2) MANUS grasp capture method for efficient and accurate contact estimation 

3) MANUS-Grasps: Large multi-view real dataset with 7M frames and 53 camera views to enable grasp capture

4) Validate contacts using paint transfer - method leaves physical trace of contacts

Overall, the paper addresses a critical limitation of existing contact estimation methods by using 3D Gaussians. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in contact accuracy compared to previous template-based methods.
