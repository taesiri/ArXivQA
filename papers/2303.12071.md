# [ProphNet: Efficient Agent-Centric Motion Forecasting with   Anchor-Informed Proposals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12071)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1. How to effectively model the heterogeneous and interrelated input sources (e.g. agent motion history, interactions, maps) for motion forecasting? The hypothesis is that a unified agent-centric scene representation (AcSR) can simplify the architecture and enable flexible learning of complex input interactions. 

2. How to enhance the inherent multimodality in motion forecasting output? The hypothesis is that generating diversified proposals firstly and then fusing them with goal-oriented anchors can promote multimodal predictions.

3. How to design an agent-centric model that achieves high accuracy while maintaining low inference latency for real-world deployment? The hypothesis is that a uniform and compact architecture focusing on key components can lead to an efficient model in both accuracy and speed.

4. Whether the proposed model ProphNet can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods? The hypothesis is that by effectively addressing the above challenges in representation, multimodality and efficiency, ProphNet can advance the performance on benchmark datasets.

In summary, this paper aims to tackle the key difficulties faced by motion forecasting through the proposed agent-centric architecture and training strategy. The core hypotheses are centered on using unified encoding, anchor-informed proposals, and compact network design to achieve accuracy, multimodality and efficiency. The experiments are conducted to validate if ProphNet can push forward the state-of-the-art in this field.
