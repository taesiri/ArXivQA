# [Evolving Assembly Code in an Adversarial Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- CodeGuru Xtreme is a coding competition where short assembly language programs ("survivors") compete in a shared memory environment to overwrite each other and cause crashes. The goal is to create survivors that can withstand attacks from adversaries and find weaknesses in their code. 

- Evolving top-notch survivors from scratch is challenging as it requires a deep understanding of assembly language, ability to detect weaknesses in opponent code, and innovation in attack strategies.

- No prior work has looked at evolving survivors for this competition. Some related works evolved simplified assembly programs or started from an existing codebase.

Proposed Solution:
- Use Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (G3P) to evolve 8086 assembly code from scratch that can beat human-written survivors from past CodeGuru competitions. 

- Define a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar to represent valid 8086 assembly programs. The grammar is general and not CodeGuru-specific.

- Evolve two-part programs with custom genetic operators like sub-tree crossover and duplicate-tree mutation.

- Fitness function rewards ability to crash opponents, survive longer, and write to more unique memory locations.

Contributions:
- Evolved programs that beat nearly 78% of past winning human-written survivors by detecting and exploiting weaknesses.

- Evolution discovered techniques like utilizing Achilles' heel in opponent code, scattered/vertical memory writes to intersect opponent code, and adding randomness.

- Thorough qualitative analysis of evolved survivors provides insights into the effectiveness of the generated code.

- Demonstrated limitations of large language models in generating survivors from scratch.

- New platform for studying genetic programming and code evolution in adversarial settings. The BNF can be reused for other assembly evolution tasks.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to evolve 8086 assembly programs that can win coding competitions through innovation and adversary exploitation. The analysis of evolved survivors also provides valuable insights.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the use of genetic programming to evolve 8086 assembly code from scratch that can defeat human-written survivors in the CodeGuru Xtreme coding competition by exploiting weaknesses in their code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

Evolving assembly code from scratch to defeat human-written survivors in the CodeGuru Xtreme competition using genetic programming. Specifically:

- Defining a grammar (in Backus-Naur Form) to represent valid 8086 assembly programs. 

- Using this grammar-guided genetic programming approach to synthesize assembly code that identifies and exploits weaknesses in past winning human-written survivors in order to defeat them.

- Demonstrating that this approach can defeat approximately 78% of past human winners.

- Comparing this approach to using a large language model (ChatGPT), showing the latter is unable to generate survivors that can win any competitions.

- Providing a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the evolved survivors and the weaknesses they identified to encourage further research on genetic programming and code evolution in adversarial environments.

The key ideas are using GP to evolve assembly code from scratch that can defeat human-designed code in an adversarial competition, defined using a general domain-independent assembly grammar representation. The evolution discovers weaknesses in the human-written code to exploit. This has applications for cybersecurity and analyzing genetic programming.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (G3P) to evolve the assembly code survivors. How does representing the individuals as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) based on the context-free grammar help guide the search process and ensure syntactic correctness? What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to other genetic programming representations?

2. The paper employs a multi-objective fitness function considering engine score, lifetime, bytes written, and writing rate. Why is using a multi-objective fitness important here? How do the different objectives guide evolution towards effective survivors? How would using just engine score as the fitness perform?

3. The paper introduces two new genetic operators - duplicate-tree mutation and exchange-trees crossover. What is the motivation behind adding these operators? How do they promote innovation in the evolutionary search process? What impact did they have on the results?

4. The analysis revealed interesting memory writing patterns in the evolved survivors, like utilizing weaknesses, scattered & vertical writing. Why do these patterns emerge? How do they help the survivor defeat the opponent? Can you hypothesize other effective patterns that could emerge?

5. The paper shows that adding randomness via PRNG patterns to the grammar improves results against certain survivors. Why does randomness help here and how does it change the evolved writing patterns? Does true randomness have disadvantages over deterministic scrappy writing?  

6. Could the methodology presented scale to evolve general survivors that can win against any opponent without knowing its code? What adaptations would be needed? What challenges do you foresee?

7. The paper demonstrates that large language models fail to produce competent survivors. Why do you think this is the case? Does it reveal inherent limitations of LLMs or limitations ofprompt engineering? 

8. Can you conceive modifications to the fitness formulation or genetic operators that could further enhance performance? What impact would a lifetime-only fitness have?

9. The paper does not benchmark computational efficiency. How could the methodology be adapted to reduce computational requirements while retaining effectiveness? 

10. The paper promotes CodeGuru as an platform for studying evolution in adversarial environments. What unique opportunities does it offer over other problems? What theoretical insights can be gained regarding open-ended evolution and arms races?
