# A Personalized Dialogue Generator with Implicit User Persona Detection

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How to develop a personalized dialogue agent that can generate responses tailored to different users by detecting and leveraging the implicit persona of the user from the dialogue context, without requiring explicit persona profiles. The key hypotheses appear to be:- The user's potential persona and its representation can be effectively modeled and learned from the dialogue history itself, without external knowledge, using latent variables and conditional variational inference. - Introducing perception and fader latent variables to simulate the process of mutual persona awareness and corresponding expression can help generate personalized and engaging responses.- Modeling the user's implicit persona allows generating responses that are more considerate of the user, leading to more engaging and informative dialogues.So in summary, the main goal is to show it is possible to build a personalized dialogue agent that adapts to different users by detecting their potential persona implicitly, rather than relying on explicit persona profiles. The key ideas are using conditional variational inference to model the user's latent persona and learn it from the dialogue history.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel personalized dialogue generator by detecting an implicit user persona using conditional variational inference. Specifically:- The model introduces two latent variables - a perception variable to capture the latent distribution over the user's persona, and a fader variable to control the amount of persona information exhibited in the response. - The model is trained using the stochastic gradient variational Bayes framework to reconstruct responses conditioned on the context and the two latent variables. This allows generating diverse responses incorporating the user's potential persona inferred from the dialogue history.- A new training scheme called posterior-discriminated regularization is proposed to mitigate the issue of posterior collapse that is common in VAE models for text generation.- The model does not require explicit persona descriptions as input during inference, making it more flexible and universal compared to previous personalized dialogue models. - Experiments on the ConvAI2 dataset show the model generates more engaging, persona-relevant and diverse responses compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The interpretability of the latent variables is also analyzed.In summary, the key contribution is using conditional variational inference to implicitly model the user's persona for personalized dialogue generation in an end-to-end framework, without relying on explicit persona profiles. The proposed training scheme and evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
