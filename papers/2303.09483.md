# [Achieving a Better Stability-Plasticity Trade-off via Auxiliary Networks   in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity in continual learning using an auxiliary network?

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called Auxiliary Network Continual Learning (ANCL) that combines the original continual learning model (focusing on stability) with an additional auxiliary network (promoting plasticity). The goal is to leverage both models to find a better equilibrium between retaining previous knowledge (stability) and learning new information (plasticity). 

The authors hypothesize that by controlling the relative strength of the regularization terms from the old network and auxiliary network, the ANCL framework can naturally interpolate between stability and plasticity. They test this hypothesis through extensive experiments and analysis of the ANCL solutions.

In summary, the key research question is how to strike a better stability-plasticity balance in continual learning, and the core hypothesis is that the proposed ANCL framework can achieve this by interpolating between an old model and an auxiliary model. The experiments and analyses aim to validate whether ANCL can actually improve on this trade-off compared to standard continual learning approaches.
