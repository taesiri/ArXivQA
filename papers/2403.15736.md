# [LLMs Instruct LLMs:An Extraction and Editing Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Updating large language models (LLMs) with new knowledge is important but challenging, especially in complex domains with limited data samples. This is called the Paucity-Constrained Complex Reasoning Adaptation for LLMs (PCRA-LLM) problem.  
- Traditional methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggle with PCRA-LLM, failing to incorporate knowledge effectively.

Proposed Solution:
- A 2-stage Sequential Fusion framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs)
   - Stage 1: Use general LLMs to construct KGs from complex texts via relation extraction
   - Stage 2: Update domain-specific LLMs by converting extracted KGs to natural language and editing via In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE)

Key Contributions:  
- Novel PCRA-LLM solution superior to LoRA and RAG
- New economics/management dataset (MEE) for evaluating PCRA-LLM methods 
- Comparative analyses unveiling strengths/weaknesses of knowledge representation formats and editing methods
- Demonstrated 71.69% and 75% question answering accuracy on DCE and MEE datasets respectively, 30%+ over baselines

In summary, this paper makes significant advances in addressing the PCRA-LLM problem through a staged integration of LLMs and KGs. By leveraging both knowledge extraction and editing capacities, the proposed Sequential Fusion framework enhances complex reasoning abilities in domain-specific LLMs.
