# [Taking Human out of Learning Applications: A Survey on Automated Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13306)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to create an automated system for machine learning (AutoML) that can take the place of humans in identifying proper configurations for machine learning tools. The key goals are to achieve good performance across tasks and datasets with minimal human assistance and efficient computation.

The paper provides a formal definition of AutoML and proposes a general framework for how AutoML approaches can be developed. It then categorizes existing works on AutoML based on the problem setup (what to automate) and techniques used (how to automate). Three main problem setups considered are feature engineering, model selection, and optimization algorithm selection. The techniques are divided into basic techniques for the optimizer and evaluator components and more advanced experienced techniques like meta-learning and transfer learning. 

The taxonomies and framework aim to provide an insightful guideline for AutoML research by analyzing what existing approaches try to automate and how they achieve it. The paper summarizes the current status of AutoML and suggests promising future research directions in areas like creating features automatically, developing more efficient techniques, expanding applications, and building theory.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that the proposed AutoML framework and taxonomies can guide the development of automated systems that can replace humans in configuring machine learning tools to achieve good performance across tasks with efficiency. The paper reviews and structures the growing research area of AutoML based on this hypothesis.
