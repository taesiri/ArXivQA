# [Taking Human out of Learning Applications: A Survey on Automated Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13306)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to create an automated system for machine learning (AutoML) that can take the place of humans in identifying proper configurations for machine learning tools. The key goals are to achieve good performance across tasks and datasets with minimal human assistance and efficient computation.

The paper provides a formal definition of AutoML and proposes a general framework for how AutoML approaches can be developed. It then categorizes existing works on AutoML based on the problem setup (what to automate) and techniques used (how to automate). Three main problem setups considered are feature engineering, model selection, and optimization algorithm selection. The techniques are divided into basic techniques for the optimizer and evaluator components and more advanced experienced techniques like meta-learning and transfer learning. 

The taxonomies and framework aim to provide an insightful guideline for AutoML research by analyzing what existing approaches try to automate and how they achieve it. The paper summarizes the current status of AutoML and suggests promising future research directions in areas like creating features automatically, developing more efficient techniques, expanding applications, and building theory.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that the proposed AutoML framework and taxonomies can guide the development of automated systems that can replace humans in configuring machine learning tools to achieve good performance across tasks with efficiency. The paper reviews and structures the growing research area of AutoML based on this hypothesis.

Compared to other surveys, it provides more structure and direction for the field. But it does not empirically evaluate techniques or cover unsupervised learning in depth.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several promising future research directions in automated machine learning (AutoML):

Problem Setup:
- Feature creation - Developing methods to automatically create good features directly from raw data, as currently most AutoML methods focus on feature selection/engineering rather than creation.

Techniques:  
- Efficiency - Developing more efficient optimization and evaluation methods to reduce the computational cost of AutoML. This could involve simultaneously optimizing configurations and parameters.

Applications:
- New tasks - Applying AutoML to new problems like active learning, neural network compression, semi-supervised learning etc. This requires adapting techniques to the particular challenges of each problem.

Theory:  
- Optimization theory - Analyzing the convergence rates of different AutoML techniques to determine how fast they can find good configurations.
- Learning theory - Understanding what types of learning problems AutoML can address, and analyzing the generalization ability of AutoML methods.

In summary, the authors suggest advancing AutoML by improving feature creation, efficiency, expanding applications, and developing supporting theory. This provides a good overview of the limitations of current AutoML and open problems for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a survey on automated machine learning (AutoML). It begins by defining AutoML as the process of automating the configuration and tuning of machine learning algorithms to maximize performance, with limited human assistance and computational budget. 

The key goals of AutoML are to achieve good performance across tasks and datasets, reduce the need for human expertise, and be computationally efficient. The authors propose a general AutoML framework with two key components - an optimizer that generates/updates configurations and an evaluator that measures the performance of those configurations. Taxonomies are provided for categorizing AutoML approaches based on the problem setup (e.g. feature engineering, model selection) and techniques used in the optimizer and evaluator. 

The paper discusses basic techniques like simple search, derivative-free optimization, gradient descent and greedy search for the optimizer, and direct evaluation, early stopping, parameter reusing etc. for the evaluator. It provides examples of how the framework maps to existing methods like Auto-Sklearn, NASNet and ExploreKit. The current status and future directions are summarized, suggesting problem setups like neural architecture search, applications beyond supervised learning, and theoretical analysis as promising areas for future work.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:
