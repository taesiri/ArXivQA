## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "IMPRINT: Generative Object Compositing by Learning Identity-Preserving Representation":

Problem:
Generative object compositing aims to realistically insert a foreground object into a background image. This task involves two key challenges: (1) preserving the identity/details of the inserted object, and (2) harmonizing the object with the background in terms of color, lighting, shadows, etc. Existing methods struggle to balance these two aspects - they often lose fine details of the object or fail to adapt it properly to align with the background.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework called IMPRINT to address the tradeoff between identity preservation and background alignment. 

Stage 1 focuses solely on identity preservation. A context-agnostic view reconstruction task is designed to train an image encoder to extract view-invariant identity-preserving representations of objects, which capture object details robustly.

Stage 2 then focuses on using this representation to harmonize the object with the background. The frozen identity-preserving encoder from stage 1 allows greater freedom to alter the object for seamless compositing, without losing details.

Additionally, IMPRINT incorporates mask-based control for user guidance over object pose/shape. And a background blending strategy ensures smooth transitions between object and background.

Main Contributions:
- Novel two-stage approach that decouples identity preservation and background harmonization
- Context-agnostic identity-preserving pretraining for detail retention 
- Enhanced user control over object pose/shape via masks
- State-of-the-art performance - significantly outperforms previous methods in detail preservation and composition quality

The two-stage design, pretraining scheme, and background blending allow IMPRINT to generate high-fidelity object composites with greater pose/appearance variations for alignment to backgrounds.
