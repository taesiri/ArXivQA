# [Federated Multi-Agent Mapping for Planetary Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02289)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-agent robotic systems hold promise for space exploration, enabling efficient mapping and data collection. However, managing and sharing the vast data generated poses challenges due to bandwidth constraints and decentralized information.

- Existing mapping approaches rely on onboard SLAM or transmit all raw data to a central base station. These struggle to create a unified global map view critical for planning and situational awareness.

- Learning-based methods like neural radiance fields (NeRFs) show potential but face difficulties quickly adapting to new environments and representing maps from limited, non-IID viewpoints.

Solution:
- The paper introduces a federated learning framework to create a shared global map by combining decentralized data from robotic agents without transmitting raw sensor streams. 

- It represents local maps from each agent compactly using a 2D neural radiance field (NeRF), meta-initialized on Earth elevation data to enable swift adaptation even with limited data.

- The trained 2D NeRF parameters efficiently encode the local map information. These are shared through federated averaging to create a unified global map at the base station.

- Further map refinement such as gap-filling and denoising improves coherence and removes artifacts.

Main Contributions:

1. Rapid neural network adaptation method for extreme environments via meta-initialization on Earth mapping data

2. Federated learning approach for multi-agent systems to collaboratively learn a global map representation while protecting local data privacy 

3. Demonstration of proposed technique's effectiveness on challenging spacecraft navigation tasks across icy and Martian terrains after only a single communication round between agents

The method displays strong performance in reconstructing traversable paths for planning and exploration, confirming the utility of federated implicit neural mapping for future multi-agent space missions.
