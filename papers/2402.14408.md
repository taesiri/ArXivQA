# [Transferring BERT Capabilities from High-Resource to Low-Resource   Languages Using Vocabulary Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models like BERT have revolutionized natural language processing but extending their benefits to low-resource languages is challenging due to limited text data and resources.  
- Silesian and Kashubian are two such low-resource West Slavic languages spoken by small communities in Poland that lack linguistic resources and training data.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a simple approach to transfer BERT capabilities from high-resource language (Polish) to low-resource Silesian and Kashubian using vocabulary matching. 
- Use bilingual dictionaries to map tokens between Polish BERT (HerBERT) and target language vocabulary. Embeddings for unmatched tokens are obtained by splitting and averaging.
- Results in first BERT models for Silesian and Kashubian released publicly.

Experiments and Results:
- Collected and cleaned Wikipedia dumps for Silesian and Kashubian to create pre-training corpus.  
- Evaluated masked word prediction accuracy for different BERT variants including baselines like mBERT and XLM-R.
- Vocabulary matched model surpasses fine-tuned HerBERT by 1 pp for Silesian (60.27%) and 3 pp for Kashubian (59.13%).
- Additional passage retrieval experiments on Silesian test set also show gains over baseline.

Main Contributions:
- First BERT models for low-resource Silesian and Kashubian languages publicly released.
- Demonstrate effective transfer of BERT capabilities to low-resource languages via simple vocabulary matching technique.
- Technique allows training competitive BERT models even with minimal target language training data.

In summary, the paper presents vocabulary matching to transfer BERT capabilities to low-resource languages using bilingual dictionaries. Experiments on Silesian and Kashubian showcase gains over baselines, highlighting potential for enabling language understanding for such languages.
