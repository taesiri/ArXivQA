# [Sentiment is all you need to win US Presidential elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13487)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What sentiments, emotions, and language in campaign speeches and rhetoric affect election outcomes and sway voters in U.S. Presidential elections?The authors analyze speech transcripts from Republican and Democratic candidates in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. They classify sentences from the speeches into different emotions using natural language processing and machine learning. The key research questions examined are:1) How do the sentiments and emotions used in speeches by Republican vs Democratic candidates compare, especially in speeches given in states with predominantly white populations vs predominantly black populations? 2) What specific emotions and sentiments in the speeches correlate with winning vs losing those states in the election?3) How do voters' own biases and expectations affect their reactions to the same sentiments/emotions when attributed to different parties or candidates? This is examined through a survey of voters.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the language and emotions used in campaign speeches can influence election outcomes, and the authors analyze the speeches and survey data to uncover relationships between speech sentiments and election victories/losses across different states and demographics. The key goal is understanding what rhetorical strategies are most effective for the different parties.
