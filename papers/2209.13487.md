## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What sentiments, emotions, and language in campaign speeches and rhetoric affect election outcomes and sway voters in U.S. Presidential elections?The authors analyze speech transcripts from Republican and Democratic candidates in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. They classify sentences from the speeches into different emotions using natural language processing and machine learning. The key research questions examined are:1) How do the sentiments and emotions used in speeches by Republican vs Democratic candidates compare, especially in speeches given in states with predominantly white populations vs predominantly black populations? 2) What specific emotions and sentiments in the speeches correlate with winning vs losing those states in the election?3) How do voters' own biases and expectations affect their reactions to the same sentiments/emotions when attributed to different parties or candidates? This is examined through a survey of voters.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the language and emotions used in campaign speeches can influence election outcomes, and the authors analyze the speeches and survey data to uncover relationships between speech sentiments and election victories/losses across different states and demographics. The key goal is understanding what rhetorical strategies are most effective for the different parties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to study the effect of emotions in speeches by Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2020 US Presidential election. Specifically, the paper:- Collects and analyzes transcripts of speeches by Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2020 election campaign.- Categorizes US states into "Black states" and "White states" based on demographics. - Uses a fine-tuned BERT model to classify sentences in the speeches into different emotions.- Compares the emotions used in speeches for states/demographics where each party won vs lost. - Finds some patterns in emotions associated with winning vs losing states for each party. For example, approval and happiness helped Democrats win Black states while leading to losses in White states.- Conducts a human survey to validate the hypothesis that knowing the speaker's party affiliation changes people's voting intent based on the same speech snippets.- Concludes that using certain emotions selectively in speeches tailored to states/demographics could be an effective election strategy.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating through computational analysis and surveys that emotions used in campaign speeches can influence election outcomes across different demographics. This data-driven approach could inform more effective campaigning strategies.
