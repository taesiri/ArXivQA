# [Sentiment is all you need to win US Presidential elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13487)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What sentiments, emotions, and language in campaign speeches and rhetoric affect election outcomes and sway voters in U.S. Presidential elections?The authors analyze speech transcripts from Republican and Democratic candidates in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. They classify sentences from the speeches into different emotions using natural language processing and machine learning. The key research questions examined are:1) How do the sentiments and emotions used in speeches by Republican vs Democratic candidates compare, especially in speeches given in states with predominantly white populations vs predominantly black populations? 2) What specific emotions and sentiments in the speeches correlate with winning vs losing those states in the election?3) How do voters' own biases and expectations affect their reactions to the same sentiments/emotions when attributed to different parties or candidates? This is examined through a survey of voters.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the language and emotions used in campaign speeches can influence election outcomes, and the authors analyze the speeches and survey data to uncover relationships between speech sentiments and election victories/losses across different states and demographics. The key goal is understanding what rhetorical strategies are most effective for the different parties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to study the effect of emotions in speeches by Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2020 US Presidential election. Specifically, the paper:- Collects and analyzes transcripts of speeches by Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2020 election campaign.- Categorizes US states into "Black states" and "White states" based on demographics. - Uses a fine-tuned BERT model to classify sentences in the speeches into different emotions.- Compares the emotions used in speeches for states/demographics where each party won vs lost. - Finds some patterns in emotions associated with winning vs losing states for each party. For example, approval and happiness helped Democrats win Black states while leading to losses in White states.- Conducts a human survey to validate the hypothesis that knowing the speaker's party affiliation changes people's voting intent based on the same speech snippets.- Concludes that using certain emotions selectively in speeches tailored to states/demographics could be an effective election strategy.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating through computational analysis and surveys that emotions used in campaign speeches can influence election outcomes across different demographics. This data-driven approach could inform more effective campaigning strategies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on an analysis of speeches from the 2020 US presidential election, the paper finds that using certain emotions like approval, happiness, and positivity helps Democrats win over black voters, while using emotions like comparison, sadness, and negativity helps Republicans win over white voters.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on analyzing political speeches and sentiment:- The use of machine learning for sentiment analysis is becoming more common in political speech analysis, though many existing studies still rely solely on manual content analysis. This paper leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing models like BERT for emotion classification.- Analyzing differences in speech content and emotion based on race/demographics of the target audience is an interesting angle. Many studies focus on speech content differences by party or individual politician. The racial comparisons add a new dimension.- Combining computational analysis with a human survey/perception component provides useful validation and checks on the machine learning. Many studies in this field are computational only. - The scope is limited to a relatively small set of speeches from one election cycle. Broader studies may analyze a wider range of elections and a larger set of candidates/speeches.- The simplistic categorization of states as "Black" or "White" based on a population threshold is a bit crude. More nuanced demographic data could reveal additional insights.- The study is descriptive in nature and does not make strong claims about causal relationships between speech content/emotion and election outcomes. More rigorous statistical analysis could better connect the speech features to effects on voting.Overall, the multi-modal (computational + human) analysis and focus on demographic differences advances this line of research. But the scope is limited compared to large-scale longitudinal studies of political speech. More rigorous quantitative analysis of the effects of speech content on voting would also strengthen the conclusions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Analyzing the impact of emotions in speeches on voters from different demographics (e.g. immigrants, white/blue collar workers, etc.) to understand how emotions sway voters from diverse backgrounds. - Considering multiple years of presidential election rally speeches to understand how people's aspirations have changed over time and how candidates cater to those changing aspirations.- Incorporating more contextual factors beyond just the speeches themselves, such as voters' prejudices against candidates/parties, to better model the complexities behind voting behavior.  - Expanding the emotion analysis beyond a limited lexicon to capture a broader understanding of how speech sentiments affect individuals.- Validating the findings on a larger dataset across elections over many years to gain more robust insights into the interplay between speech emotions and voting behavior.- Developing predictive models that can forecast the impact of certain emotions/speech styles on voting for a given demographic.In summary, the authors call for more expansive, longitudinal and contextual analyses of speech emotions and voting behavior across demographics to gain a deeper understanding of this relationship.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper analyzes the speeches given by Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2020 US Presidential election campaign to understand the role of sentiments and emotions in influencing election outcomes. The authors collected transcripts of speeches given in various states and categorized them by race demographics. They then used natural language processing methods to classify sentences in the speeches into different emotions. Comparing speeches that led to wins versus losses in white versus black majority states for each party, they found similarities and differences in the prevalent emotions used. For example, approval and desire emotions were associated with Democratic wins in black states while curiosity and disapproval were associated with Republican losses in both white and black states. The authors also conducted a survey asking people to judge speech snippets, finding individual biases affecting voting intentions. The work provides insights into how campaign communications could be tailored based on voter demographics and expectations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper analyzes the speeches given by Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2020 US Presidential election campaign. The authors collected transcripts of speeches given in both predominantly white and predominantly black states. Using natural language processing and a fine-tuned BERT model, they categorized sentences from the speeches into different emotions. Comparing speeches that led to wins versus losses in white versus black states, they found some notable differences. For Republicans, sentences expressing comparison and sadness were more common in speeches leading to wins in black states but losses in white states. For Democrats, sentences expressing approval and happiness were more common in speeches leading to wins in black states but losses in white states. The authors also conducted a survey asking people to evaluate speech snippets, finding that providing information about the speaker's party impacted people's voting intent. Overall, the analysis reveals how different emotions expressed in campaign speeches can influence election outcomes across racial demographics.In summary, this paper analyzes transcripts of speeches from the 2020 US Presidential election to understand differences in emotional content and impact across racial demographics. The authors categorize speech sentences into emotions using natural language processing, revealing emotion patterns linked to winning and losing speeches. A human survey also shows party information impacts people's voting intent based on speech snippets. The work provides insight into how campaign messaging and speech emotions may influence election results.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The authors collected transcripts of election campaign speeches given by Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2020 US Presidential election. They categorized each state where the speeches were given as either a "Black state" or a "White state" based on the racial demographics of the state. The speeches were processed through a fine-tuned BERT model to classify each sentence into one of 27 emotions. The frequency of different emotions was compared between speeches given in states won or lost by each party. A survey was also conducted where participants read short speech snippets labeled with or without speaker information and indicated if they would vote for that candidate. The sentiments and survey results were analyzed to understand how different emotions swayed voting behavior between White and Black states for the Republican and Democratic parties.
