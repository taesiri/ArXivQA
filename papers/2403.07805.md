# [Beyond Memorization: The Challenge of Random Memory Access in Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper investigates how language models (LMs) access the knowledge stored in their parameters, specifically whether they can sequentially access memorized content or randomly access parts of it. 
- Through experiments, they find LMs can adequately reproduce memorized content sequentially but struggle with random access of segments in the middle of memorized passages.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes two strategies to mitigate the limitation of poor random access ability: recitation and permutation. 
- Recitation means prompting the LM to first sequentially read relevant memorized passages before performing a downstream task, thus having the passage loaded into the context window for random access.  
- Permutation refers to changing the order of sentences in passages during training which enhances the model's ability to start recall from any point.

Key Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrates LMs can sequentially access parametric memory to reproduce memorized textual content with high accuracy.
- Reveals through controlled experiments that LMs have significant challenges in randomly accessing memorized passages without starting from the beginning.
- Validates two effective strategies of recitation and permutation to mitigate poor random access ability, with measurable improvements on both synthetic tasks and open-domain QA.
- Highlights broader implications of the identified limitation in random memory access on LM applications and provides solutions.
- Overall, advances our understanding of knowledge access mechanisms in language models regarding sequential versus random access.
