# [Dual Instruction Tuning with Large Language Models for Mathematical   Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Recent advances with large language models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have shown promise in mathematical reasoning tasks. However, challenges still exist such as incorrect, missing, and redundant steps in the CoT leading to inaccurate answer predictions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a dual instruction tuning strategy to model mathematical reasoning carefully from both the forward direction (original instruction to CoT) and reverse direction (CoT back to instruction). The strategy involves two tasks:

1) Intermediate Reasoning State Prediction (IRSP): Masks some intermediary reasoning steps in a given CoT and has the model predict the masked steps based on the partial CoT and instructions.

2) Instruction Reconstruction (IR): Randomly masks some clauses or questions containing numbers in the instruction and has the model reconstruct them from the full CoT.

Training data for these tasks is constructed from an existing mathematical instruction tuning dataset. The tasks are then used alongside the existing data for multi-task fine-tuning of LLMs.

Main Contributions:

- A novel dual instruction tuning strategy with IRSP and IR tasks to enhance LLM's understanding and execution of instructions from both directions.

- Construction of new training data and tasks for the dual tuning strategy.

- Experiments showing improved reasoning ability and domain generalization across various mathematical reasoning datasets when using the proposed approach for fine-tuning LLMs.

In summary, the dual tuning strategy aims to improve comprehension of mapping between instructions and chain of thought to address issues like errors, omissions and redundancies in the reasoning steps.
