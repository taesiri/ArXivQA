# [F-MALLOC: Feed-forward Memory Allocation for Continual Learning in   Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural machine translation (NMT) models are typically pretrained on large general domain corpora and then finetuned on specific target domains. However, finetuning leads to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of the general domain knowledge.
- Existing continual learning (CL) methods to mitigate CF have limitations in balancing stability (avoiding forgetting) and plasticity (learning new tasks). Regularization-based methods struggle to adapt to new tasks. Architecture-based methods require prior task number specifications and extra parameter storage.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new CL method called F-MALLOC (Feed-forward Memory Allocation) that allocates and protects the feed-forward layer memories in Transformers to enable continual learning.
- Key ideas:
   - Feed-forward layers act as memory cells that store translation knowledge
   - Structurally prune unimportant feed-forward memories after general domain pretraining  
   - Learn non-exclusive binary task masks to allocate the 'writable' memories to new tasks
   - Aggregate previous tasks' masks and use them to block gradient updates to 'read-only' memories
   - Achieve adaptive memory allocation and protection for continual learning

Main Contributions:
- Proposed F-MALLOC, a highly effective and robust CL method requiring no prior task numbers or extra parameter storage
- Introduced a tailored multi-stage evaluation protocol for CL in NMT with metrics assessing stability, plasticity and domain order robustness
- Demonstrated F-MALLOC's superior performance over strong baselines like EWC, KD and PTE
- Showed F-MALLOC's adaptive memory allocation ability utilizing task difficulty and inter-task similarity information

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in continual learning for neural machine translation through an ingenious yet simple method of strategic feed-forward memory allocation and protection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes F-MALLOC, a continual learning method for neural machine translation that prevents catastrophic forgetting and promotes new knowledge acquisition by decomposing feed-forward layers into memory cells and implementing a strategic allocation approach to protect the memories encoding crucial prior knowledge while allowing new task learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing F-MALLOC, a multi-stage continual learning method for neural machine translation that prevents forgetting and promotes new knowledge acquisition through feed-forward memory allocation. It requires no prior task information and minimal storage overhead.

2. Introducing a tailored evaluation protocol for continual learning in neural machine translation systems to better understand system performance on both stability and plasticity over multiple stages. 

3. Demonstrating through experiments and analysis that F-MALLOC is superior in performance compared to existing approaches, showcasing substantial improvements in robustness and extensibility. The method also effectively leverages task difficulty and inter-task similarities to optimize capacity usage and encourage knowledge transfer.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of F-MALLOC, a novel continual learning method for neural machine translation that is effective, robust, and extensible through its strategic allocation and protection of feed-forward memories across tasks. The other contributions provide support for demonstrating the advantages of this proposed method.
