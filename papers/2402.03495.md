# [Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03495)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing infinitely deep Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) based on Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) have limitations around computational efficiency and scalability due to relying on full stochasticity. 

- Methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo or variational inference for BNNs are computationally intensive as they require many iterations or complex optimization procedures to accurately approximate the posterior distribution over all network weights.

- Storing and processing multiple weight samples during training and inference further increases the computational burden.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks (PSDE-BNNs) which restricts stochasticity to only a subset of the network's weights. 

- This is achieved by modelling the weight evolution through a combination of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

- The weights are split into stochastic and deterministic groups either "vertically" across layers or "horizontally" within layers.

- Mathematical frameworks are provided to incorporate partial stochasticity into infinitely deep BNNs through the weight dynamics.

Contributions:
- Concept of partial stochasticity introduced to continuous-time neural network models.

- Detailed mathematical formulation given to model evolution of deterministic and stochastic weight subsets in infinitely deep BNNs. 

- Proof that while constrained fully stochastic infinitely deep BNNs cannot be Universal Conditional Distribution Approximators, PSDE-BNNs can qualify given specific conditions.

- Empirical evaluations showing PSDE-BNNs achieve better performance and uncertainty quantification than fully stochastic counterparts while having significantly better efficiency.

- Comprehensive ablation studies conducted on key PSDE-BNN hyperparameters.

In summary, the paper proposes PSDE-BNNs that restrict full weight stochasticity to improve limitations of existing infinitely deep BNNs, with mathematical and empirical backing.
