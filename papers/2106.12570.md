# [Learning Multimodal VAEs through Mutual Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12570)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop an effective multimodal variational autoencoder (VAE) that can learn from partially observed data, where some modalities may be entirely missing?

The key hypotheses explored in addressing this question are:

1) Existing multimodal VAEs combine information across modalities through explicit products, mixtures, or other factorizations in the model. Instead, we can leverage techniques from semi-supervised VAEs to allow modalities to implicitly supervise each other through the VAE objective. 

2) This implicit combination of information will allow the model to naturally handle missing modalities during training, without needing any special components or modifications.

3) The proposed model, termed MEME, will outperform existing multimodal VAEs in capturing semantic similarity across modalities, even when trained on partially observed data.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that an implicit combination of modalities through mutual supervision will yield improved multimodal representations, especially in the partially observed setting, compared to prior explicit combination approaches. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis across different datasets and missing data configurations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new method for learning multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) called MEME (Mutually Supervised Multimodal VAE). 

2. Using semi-supervised VAE techniques to enable implicit combination of information between modalities through mutual supervision. This avoids the need for explicit product or mixture distributions in the prior that are commonly used.

3. Demonstrating that MEME can naturally handle learning from partially observed data, where some modalities may be entirely missing. Many previous multimodal VAE methods cannot handle this setting well.

4. Evaluating MEME on the MNIST-SVHN and CUB datasets for image-image and image-text modalities. Showing it outperforms previous baselines like MVAE and MMVAE on standard metrics for both fully and partially observed settings.

5. Analyzing the latent representations learned by MEME and showing it better captures semantic similarity or "relatedness" between instances from different modalities compared to baselines.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the MEME model for multimodal VAEs that leverages implicit mutual supervision and can effectively learn from partial data, outperforming previous approaches on standard evaluation metrics. The other contributions are around evaluating this method and analyzing the quality of representations it learns.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel multimodal variational autoencoder called MEME that combines information between modalities through mutual supervision, avoiding explicit combination methods used in prior work, and enables learning from partially observed data where some modalities may be entirely missing.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research on multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs):

- The key contribution of this paper is introducing a new approach called MEME (Mutually Supervised Multimodal VAE) that uses mutual supervision between modalities to implicitly combine multimodal information. This avoids the need for explicitly defining mixture or product distributions over modalities as done in prior work like MVAE, MMVAE, and MoPoE-VAE.

- MEME is able to naturally handle learning from partially observed data, where some modalities may be entirely missing. This is a significant advantage over prior approaches like MVAE and MMVAE which rely on having full observations. VSVAE is another recent approach that can handle missing modalities but requires additional components like mask networks. 

- Experiments demonstrate MEME outperforms MVAE and MMVAE baselines on standard metrics like cross-coherence for reconstruction and latent classification accuracy. The gains are consistent across both complete and partial observation settings.

- MEME is evaluated on typical image-image (MNIST-SVHN) and image-text (CUB) multimodal datasets. Using CUB is less common than MNIST-SVHN in prior work, demonstrating MEME's capabilities on more complex and challenging data.

- Analysis of the learned representations shows MEME better captures semantic relatedness between modalities, as measured by Wasserstein distances between encodings. This is a novel analysis not present in prior work.

- The approach follows a similar motivation to other recent methods like mmJSD and MoPoE-VAE to avoid explicitly defining joint distributions. But MEME introduces a distinct way of combining information implicitly through mutual supervision.

Overall, MEME introduces a new perspective on training multimodal VAEs through mutual supervision and demonstrates strong improvements over prior art, especially in handling missing modalities. The analysis of representation quality is also novel. The consistent gains on complex image-text data are impressive given most prior work focuses on simpler image-image datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions the authors suggest:

- Developing more advanced and flexible approaches for combining the information from multiple modalities, beyond simple concatenation or straightforward factorization approaches. They suggest exploring more complex interactions and alignments between modalities.

- Exploring different architectural designs and objective functions for multimodal VAEs to improve modeling of joint distributions and handling of missing modalities. 

- Evaluating multimodal VAEs on a wider range of multimodal datasets beyond just image-image or image-text pairs. Applying them to areas like robotics with many heterogeneous sensory modalities.

- Developing better metrics and probes for evaluating the quality of joint representations learned by multimodal VAEs. The authors suggest measures that directly assess semantic relatedness in the latent space.

- Scaling multimodal VAEs to handle more than just two or three modalities, which poses challenges in model formulation, optimization, and computation.

- Studying how well multimodal VAEs can perform downstream tasks like classification, retrieval, or conditional generation when conditioned on one modality and generating another.

- Comparing multimodal VAEs to other types of deep generative models like GANs. The authors suggest this as an interesting direction for future work.

- Exploring how multimodal VAEs could be used for semi-supervised or weakly supervised learning by taking advantage of their ability to leverage partially observed data.

So in summary, they highlight opportunities for better architectures, training schemes, evaluation metrics, and applications of multimodal VAEs as interesting areas for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multimodal variational autoencoder (VAE) framework called MEME (Mutually supervisEd Multimodal VAE) that leverages ideas from semi-supervised VAEs to implicitly combine information across modalities through mutual supervision. Unlike prior approaches that explicitly combine modality-specific representations, MEME avoids explicit combinations by treating each encoder as both an inference network and a conditional prior that regularizes the other encoder. This allows MEME to naturally handle learning from partially observed data where some modalities may be entirely missing. The authors demonstrate that MEME outperforms baselines on standard metrics for both fully and partially observed data on MNIST-SVHN (image-image) and CUB (image-text) datasets. They also show MEME better captures semantic relatedness across modalities in the latent space compared to baselines. A key advantage is MEME's flexibility in learning from partial observations without needing additional components.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new method for training multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) called Mutually Supervised Multimodal VAE (MEME). Multimodal VAEs aim to model the joint distribution over heterogeneous data like images and text. Previous methods combine information from different modalities using explicit products or mixtures in the posterior distribution. In contrast, MEME uses an implicit combination inspired by semi-supervised VAEs. It treats one modality's encoder as a prior distribution that regularizes the other modality's posterior through the VAE objective's KL term. By symmetrizing this process, the modalities mutually supervise each other to combine information. 

A key advantage of MEME is its ability to handle partially observed data where some modalities are missing. It uses learnable pseudo-samples to estimate the conditional prior for missing modalities. Experiments on MNIST-SVHN and CUB datasets show MEME outperforms baselines on coherence and accuracy metrics in both fully and partially observed settings. Analysis of the learned representations indicates MEME better captures semantic similarity between modalities. The implicit combination and partial data handling are useful improvements over previous multimodal VAE methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method presented in this paper is a novel approach to learning multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) that enables learning from partially observed data. 

The key idea is to leverage recent advances in semi-supervised VAEs to allow implicit combinations of information between modalities through mutual supervision. In particular, the proposed MEME (Mutually supErvised Multimodal VAE) method treats the combination of information through a semi-supervised lens by viewing one modality as a conditional prior that regularizes the encoding distribution of the other modality through the VAE's KL divergence term. By mirroring this arrangement, multimodal VAEs can be learned through mutual supervision between modalities. 

This approach avoids explicit combination of representations as done in prior multimodal VAE methods. More importantly, it naturally handles learning from partially observed data, where some modalities may be entirely missing, which most existing approaches cannot handle well. The efficacy of MEME is demonstrated on MNIST-SVHN and CUB datasets across both fully and partially observed settings, where it outperforms previous baselines.

In summary, the key novelty is an implicit combination of information between modalities for multimodal VAEs through mutual supervision, enabled by a semi-supervised formulation, that also facilitates learning from partial observations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The main problem this paper is addressing is how to effectively learn useful shared representations for multimodal data. Some key aspects:

- Multimodal data consists of heterogeneous observations related to some underlying concept, e.g. images and captions of a scene. Modeling the joint distribution of such data is challenging.

- Variational autoencoders (VAEs) provide a useful framework for modeling multimodal data using latent representations. But how to effectively combine information from different modalities in the VAE remains an open question. 

- Prior VAE approaches combine modalities explicitly through products, mixtures etc. But these have limitations e.g. in handling missing modalities.

- This paper proposes an alternative "mutual supervision" approach called MEME that leverages advances in semi-supervised VAEs. The core idea is to use the VAE framework itself to implicitly combine modalities through posterior-prior regularization.

- This avoids needing explicit combinations, naturally handles missing modalities, and outperforms baselines on metrics for modeling joint distributions and capturing semantic similarity.

In summary, the key contribution is a new way to learn shared latent representations in VAEs for multimodal data using mutual supervision, with advantages over prior explicit combination approaches. The effectiveness is demonstrated on image-image and image-text datasets.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for learning multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) through mutual supervision between modalities. Rather than combining information through explicit products or mixtures in the latent space, the approach uses ideas from semi-supervised learning to implicitly regularize the latent representations of each modality using the other modalities as conditional priors. This allows the model, termed MEME (Mutually Supervised Multimodal VAE), to learn semantically meaningful joint representations from heterogeneous data like images and text. A key advantage is the ability to naturally handle missing modalities at train and test time. Experiments on MNIST-SVHN and CUB datasets demonstrate superior performance to prior methods on coherence metrics and latent classification tasks, especially in the partial observation setting. Qualitative analysis also shows MEME better captures semantic relatedness between modalities in the learned embedding space. The mutual supervision framework offers a simple but effective alternative to existing multimodal VAE methods.
