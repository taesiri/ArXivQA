# [Is Style All You Need? Dependencies Between Emotion and GST-based   Speaker Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08213)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether speaker identity embeddings extracted from speech samples can be used for detection and classification of emotion. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that vocal expression changes speaker-dependent attributes, consequently affecting the extracted speaker embeddings. They test this by using speaker identity embeddings from a pre-trained DeepTalk model for emotion classification and detection tasks.The key hypothesis is that a speaker sounds less like themselves when their emotion changes, so the emotion state should be detectable from the speaker identity embeddings that capture vocal style.
