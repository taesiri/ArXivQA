# [UniFormerV2: Spatiotemporal Learning by Arming Image ViTs with Video   UniFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09552)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively and efficiently arm image-pretrained vision transformers (ViTs) with video modeling capability for action recognition? 

The key points are:

- Image-pretrained ViTs have shown strong performance on image tasks, but it is challenging to adapt them for effective and efficient video modeling. 

- This paper proposes a new model called UniFormerV2 that equips ViTs with efficient video relation modeling blocks from UniFormer to enhance spatiotemporal representation learning.

- Specifically, it inserts local temporal blocks to reduce redundancy and global query-based blocks to summarize tokens into a video representation. It also adopts multi-stage fusion to integrate multi-scale features.

- Experiments show UniFormerV2 achieves new state-of-the-art results on major video benchmarks like Kinetics and Something-Something. It is the first model to reach 90% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400.

- This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of arming image-pretrained ViTs with UniFormer designs for video modeling and action recognition.

In summary, the central hypothesis is equipping ViTs with efficient UniFormer-style blocks can lead to strong video recognition models that integrate the advantages of both image transformers and concise video architectures. The results validate this hypothesis and show the promise of this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the main contributions of the paper:

- The paper proposes UniFormerV2, a new video model that integrates the advantages of both image Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the UniFormer video architecture. 

- It introduces efficient designs for arming image-pretrained ViTs with video modeling capacity, including local and global UniBlocks with new Multi-Head Relation Aggregators (MHRAs), as well as a multi-stage fusion block.

- The local UniBlock reduces temporal redundancy by inserting a local temporal MHRA before the ViT block. The global UniBlock summarizes the video into a single token using a cross-attention MHRA. 

- The multi-stage fusion adaptively integrates the global tokens from each stage to enhance the video representation.

- The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 popular video benchmarks, including Kinetics, Moments in Time, Something-Something, ActivityNet and HACS.

- On Kinetics-400, UniFormerV2 is the first model to achieve over 90% top-1 accuracy. It also significantly outperforms prior work on the untrimmed ActivityNet and HACS datasets.

- The work introduces a compact Kinetics-710 benchmark for efficient video pretraining. Models pretrained on it require much less finetuning to achieve strong performance on Kinetics.

In summary, the key contribution is a new network design that effectively combines the powers of Vision Transformers and the UniFormer architecture for state-of-the-art video recognition. The model pushes accuracy boundaries while maintaining efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes UniFormerV2, a video recognition model that effectively integrates the strengths of image-pretrained Vision Transformers and efficient video relation modeling from UniFormer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on major video benchmarks including 90.0% top-1 on Kinetics-400.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of video classification:

- The paper proposes a new video classification model called UniFormerV2, which is based on arming image-pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) with efficient designs from the UniFormer model. Most prior work has focused on extending ViTs for video by adding temporal modeling directly to the ViT architecture. In contrast, this paper takes a different approach of integrating complementary designs from UniFormer into ViT.

- Compared to models without image pretraining like VideoMAE and MViT, UniFormerV2 achieves better performance on Something-Something V2 with significantly fewer training epochs. This demonstrates the benefit of image pretraining for video tasks. 

- Compared to models pretrained on ImageNet like TimeSformer, UniFormerV2 achieves much higher accuracy on Something-Something benchmarks, indicating it is more effective at temporal modeling.

- UniFormerV2 obtains state-of-the-art results on several datasets including Kinetics, Moments in Time, Something-Something, ActivityNet, and HACS. It is the first model to achieve over 90% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400.

- The model is also efficient in terms of training. By pretraining on the proposed Kinetics-710 dataset, UniFormerV2 requires much less finetuning on downstream datasets compared to training from scratch.

- Overall, UniFormerV2 advances the state-of-the-art in video classification by effectively integrating the strengths of Vision Transformers and UniFormer in an efficient training framework. The strong results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

In summary, this paper makes several novel contributions compared to prior work in efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for spatiotemporal representation learning. The UniFormerV2 model and training framework advance video classification performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:

- Developing spatiotemporal pre-training methods for UniFormerV2. The authors note that UniFormerV2 relies on image pre-training and inherits the robust visual representation from image Vision Transformers. They suggest exploring pre-training UniFormerV2 directly on large-scale video datasets to further evaluate its scalability and generalization.

- Exploring UniFormerV2 based on even larger foundation models pretrained with more data. The performance of UniFormerV2 depends somewhat on the scale of the image pre-training data. Applying UniFormerV2 to huge image foundation models pretrained on massive datasets could further improve performance.

- Extending UniFormerV2 to other video understanding tasks beyond classification, such as detection, segmentation, etc. The authors designed UniFormerV2 for video classification, but the model could likely be adapted to other video analysis tasks as well.

- Improving the temporal modeling capacity of UniFormerV2, especially for complex fine-grained actions. The authors show UniFormerV2 achieves excellent results on scene-related video datasets, but note there is room for improvement on temporal modeling for datasets like Something-Something.

- Further improving the efficiency and reducing the redundancy in UniFormerV2's modeling. Though UniFormerV2 is efficient compared to some other methods, there may be opportunities to optimize it further.

In summary, the main future directions are developing self-supervised pre-training methods for UniFormerV2, applying it to even larger models, extending it to other tasks, and continuing to improve its temporal modeling efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes UniFormerV2, a video modeling framework that combines the strengths of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and UniFormer. UniFormerV2 inserts efficient UniFormer designs, including local and global video relation aggregators, into image-pretrained ViTs. This allows UniFormerV2 to effectively capture both local and global spatiotemporal video representations while leveraging the robust spatial features learned during image pretraining. UniFormerV2 uses a local temporal Multi-Head Relation Aggregator (MHRA) to reduce redundancy and a global cross MHRA to summarize tokens into a video representation. It also employs multi-stage fusion to integrate multi-scale representations. Experiments on 8 video datasets show UniFormerV2 achieves state-of-the-art results. It is the first model to reach 90% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400. UniFormerV2 demonstrates an effective and efficient way to arm image-pretrained ViTs with concise video-specific designs for spatiotemporal modeling.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new video understanding model called UniFormerV2, which integrates the strengths of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the UniFormer architecture. The key idea is to take advantage of pretrained image ViTs which have robust visual representations learned from large datasets, and enhance them with efficient spatiotemporal modeling capabilities inspired by UniFormer. 

UniFormerV2 consists of local and global UniBlocks. The local UniBlock reduces temporal redundancy by inserting a local temporal Multi-Head Relation Aggregator (MHRA) before the ViT block. The global UniBlock uses a query-based cross MHRA to summarize the video into a single token efficiently. A multi-stage fusion block then combines the local and global features adaptively. Experiments on 8 video datasets show UniFormerV2 achieves state-of-the-art results. For example, with a Compact Kinetics-710 benchmark for post-pretraining, it obtains 90.0% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400, outperforming prior work. The results demonstrate UniFormerV2 successfully integrates the advantages of pretrained ViTs and UniFormer for effective and efficient spatiotemporal representation learning.
