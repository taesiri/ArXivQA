# [Top Leaderboard Ranking = Top Coding Proficiency, Always? EvoEval:   Evolving Coding Benchmarks via LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses limitations of existing benchmarks used to evaluate the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, it points out that current benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP have a limited number of problems, lack variety, are prone to data leakage, and may not reliably rank LLMs due to score saturation at the top. As more LLMs are developed for code, the question arises whether leaderboard performance on these benchmarks reliably and comprehensively measures code synthesis abilities.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper introduces EvoEval, a benchmark suite created by "evolving" existing problems in HumanEval into different targeted domains using prompts for GPT-4. EvoEval contains 828 problems across 7 datasets: 5 that semantically alter problems (Difficult, Creative, Subtle, Combine, Tool Use) and 2 that preserve semantics (Verbose, Concise). The Difficult dataset adds constraints and reasoning steps, Creative generates unusual narratives, Subtle makes minor changes, Combine integrates concepts from two problems, and Tool Use provides helper functions. The process refines problems for clarity, generates ground truth solutions and test cases, and manually checks for correctness.

Contributions:
- Comprehensive evolved benchmark suite to evaluate LLMs more holistically 
- Approach to synthesize coding problems and reduce manual effort via self-consistency
- Study on 51 LLMs showing significant performance drops vs. HumanEval (39.4% on average), non-uniform drops leading to ranking changes, struggles of instruction-tuned LLMs on rephrasing and tool use
- Analysis of limitations in problem composition and decomposition

The benchmark and tools have been open-sourced to facilitate more reliable evaluation of progress in code generation models. Overall, the work demonstrates shortcomings of current methods when evaluated on more diverse and challenging problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces EvoEval, a benchmark suite for evaluating large language models on program synthesis tasks, created by evolving existing problems to generate more comprehensive, challenging, and leakage-resistant evaluation sets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing EvoEval, a new benchmark suite for evaluating program synthesis abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:

1) EvoEval evolves existing benchmark problems like HumanEval into more complex and challenging problems using targeted transformation prompts. This helps create more comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate LLMs. 

2) The paper presents a pipeline to generate the new benchmark problems and refine them to ensure clarity and correctness. This includes automatically generating ground truth solutions and test cases.

3) The paper evaluates 51 LLMs on EvoEval and shows significant performance drops compared to HumanEval, indicating overfitting of existing benchmarks. It also reveals insights like brittleness of instruction-following models and limitations in problem composition.

4) EvoEval enables more reliable and holistic evaluation of LLM program synthesis abilities. It helps identify strengths and weaknesses of models across different coding domains and problem types. 

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a novel benchmark suite to drive progress in LLM program synthesis through more comprehensive evaluation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes evolving existing benchmark problems into targeted domains using transformation prompts. How effective is this approach in ensuring sufficient coverage and diversity compared to hand-designing additional benchmark problems? What are the limitations?

2. The refinement pipeline aims to fix inconsistencies and ambiguities in the initially generated problems. However, how do we ensure the refined problem still matches the original intended transformation? Does the refinement reduce diversity? 

3. For the groundtruth and testcase generation process, what measures are taken to validate quality and correctness beyond simple self-consistency? How robust is this approach?

4. The authors categorize prompts as either semantic-altering or semantic-preserving. What are some examples of subtle differences between these categories that are challenging to identify algorithmically?

5. Tool usage is tested by providing helper functions separate from the main problem. Should the prompts explicitly require or prohibit usage of helpers? How does optional helper usage align with real-world coding practices?  

6. The composition and decomposition benchmarks aim to test generalization of concepts. However, what prevents encoded biases or limitations? How can we develop better techniques to isolate specific skills?

7. The benchmarks are generated using a single model GPT-4. How sensitive are the results to this choice? Would an ensemble evolve more diverse problems? How can the approach prevent model bias?

8. The paper focuses on Python programming problems. How difficult would it be to apply the methodology to other programming languages? What adaptations would be required?

9. The benchmarks are statically generated. How can the methodology be extended to continually expand the benchmark suite over time as models improve? What are possible interactive evaluation avenues?  

10. Beyond functional correctness, how can this evolutionary prompting approach be adapted to generate benchmarks targeting non-functional attributes like efficiency, clarity, concision etc? What metrics can augment accuracy?
