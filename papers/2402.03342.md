# [MADRL-based UAVs Trajectory Design with Anti-Collision Mechanism in   Vehicular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using UAVs as aerial base stations (UABS) is promising for future 6G networks to provide connectivity to vehicles needing high data rates. However, optimally designing trajectories for multiple cooperating UABS is challenging.  
- A critical issue is ensuring collision-free paths among UAVs. Traditional methods using penalties during training are often ineffective. While binary masks can restrict unsafe actions, applying them naively to all agents leads to suboptimal solutions.

Proposed Solution:
- A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) model to optimize trajectories of a UABS swarm deployed in an urban area.
- A rank-based binary masking approach for collision avoidance. Higher ranked UAVs move freely on optimal trajectories, while lower ranked UAVs use this information to define improved binary masks. This reduces unsafe actions while allowing better exploration.
- Ranking based on number of vehicles covered by each UABS. The highest ranked UAV in a potential collision situation can move freely, while the lower ranked UAV calculates a constrained action set.

Main Contributions:
- Novel MADRL model to optimize UABS trajectories in an urban vehicular network while ensuring collision avoidance.
- Introduction of rank-based masking approach that allows higher ranked UAVs to move optimally, while lower ranked ones respect safety constraints.
- Achieves good trade-off between exploration and exploitation during training compared to penalty and flat masking techniques.
- Simulation results demonstrate complete collision avoidance and improved network performance over baselines.

In summary, the key innovation is the ranked masking technique to constrain lower priority UAVs in potential collision situations, while allowing higher priority UAVs to explore optimal trajectories. This maximizes performance gains for the UABS swarm.
