# [Towards Authentic Face Restoration with Iterative Diffusion Models and   Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08996)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key aspects of this paper are:

- It points out limitations of existing face restoration models in preserving identity details and high-frequency facial features. The models often lose details or generate artifacts.

- It proposes an authentic face restoration system called IDM based on iteratively learned denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to address these issues. 

- The key hypothesis is that DDMs are well suited for authentic restoration due to:

1) Intrinsic iterative refinement - the dense architecture and iterative process helps preserve high-quality content and remove degradations.

2) Extrinsic iterative enhancement - the model can be used to enhance the training data, enabling further improvement in restoration quality in subsequent iterations.

- Beyond restoration, the paper shows the enhanced training data can also improve image generation, stabilizing GAN training and improving sample quality without changing the baseline models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an iterative learning approach with DDMs can enable authentic and high-quality face restoration, while also improving data quality to benefit downstream generation tasks. The experiments aim to validate these capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It points out the issues of existing face restoration systems and formulates the definition of authentic restoration to examine the effectiveness of any face restoration model. 

2. It proposes IDM, an iteratively learned face restoration system based on denoising diffusion models (DDMs). It argues that DDMs are naturally endowed with the properties of intrinsic iterative refinement and extrinsic iterative enhancement for authentic restoration.

3. It demonstrates strong empirical results on two benchmarks - blind face restoration and image generation. The proposed IDM model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on face restoration. It also shows that the authentically cleaned data from IDM can benefit image generation tasks using either GANs or diffusion models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an iterative diffusion model (IDM) for authentic face restoration. IDM leverages the iterative refinement capability of diffusion models to preserve details and remove degradations. It also cleans the training data in an iterative manner for more accurate restoration. Experiments validate IDM's effectiveness on face restoration and improving image generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an iterative learned face restoration system using denoising diffusion models that can authentically restore faces by iteratively refining details while removing degradations, and demonstrates improved performance on blind face restoration and benefits for generative model training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other research in the field of face restoration:

- The main contribution is proposing an iteratively learned face restoration system based on denoising diffusion models (IDM). This is a novel approach compared to most prior work that uses single-stage models like CNNs or transformers. The iterative intrinsic and extrinsic learning with diffusion models allows more authentic restoration that preserves details better.

- The idea of using diffusion models for image restoration has been explored before in some recent works, but this paper presents the first thorough study applying denoising diffusion for high-quality face restoration and shows superior results. 

- Many previous face restoration methods rely on leveraging pretrained generative models like StyleGAN as facial priors. This paper trains diffusion models from scratch which avoids inversion artifacts and allows better identity preservation.

- A key novelty is using the model's own restoration results to iteratively enhance the training data, which further boosts performance in an extrinsic learning loop. This data enhancement idea is simple but impactful.

- The proposed method sets new state-of-the-art results on blind face restoration tasks, outperforming recent models like GFPGAN, CodeFormer, etc on both subjective and objective metrics.

- An interesting finding is that the enhanced training data also stabilizes and improves image generation models like GANs and diffusion models. This demonstrates the broader value of the restoration model beyond just restoration.

- The ideas like authenticity criteria, iterative intrinsic and extrinsic learning seem generally applicable beyond faces too, to other image restoration problems.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in face restoration with a novel diffusion-based iterative learning approach and data enhancement idea. The results are impressive and the approach may inspire more iterative restoration learning in future.
