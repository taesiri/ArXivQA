# [Towards Authentic Face Restoration with Iterative Diffusion Models and   Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08996)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key aspects of this paper are:

- It points out limitations of existing face restoration models in preserving identity details and high-frequency facial features. The models often lose details or generate artifacts.

- It proposes an authentic face restoration system called IDM based on iteratively learned denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to address these issues. 

- The key hypothesis is that DDMs are well suited for authentic restoration due to:

1) Intrinsic iterative refinement - the dense architecture and iterative process helps preserve high-quality content and remove degradations.

2) Extrinsic iterative enhancement - the model can be used to enhance the training data, enabling further improvement in restoration quality in subsequent iterations.

- Beyond restoration, the paper shows the enhanced training data can also improve image generation, stabilizing GAN training and improving sample quality without changing the baseline models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an iterative learning approach with DDMs can enable authentic and high-quality face restoration, while also improving data quality to benefit downstream generation tasks. The experiments aim to validate these capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It points out the issues of existing face restoration systems and formulates the definition of authentic restoration to examine the effectiveness of any face restoration model. 

2. It proposes IDM, an iteratively learned face restoration system based on denoising diffusion models (DDMs). It argues that DDMs are naturally endowed with the properties of intrinsic iterative refinement and extrinsic iterative enhancement for authentic restoration.

3. It demonstrates strong empirical results on two benchmarks - blind face restoration and image generation. The proposed IDM model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on face restoration. It also shows that the authentically cleaned data from IDM can benefit image generation tasks using either GANs or diffusion models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an iterative diffusion model (IDM) for authentic face restoration. IDM leverages the iterative refinement capability of diffusion models to preserve details and remove degradations. It also cleans the training data in an iterative manner for more accurate restoration. Experiments validate IDM's effectiveness on face restoration and improving image generation.
