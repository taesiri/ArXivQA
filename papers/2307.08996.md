# [Towards Authentic Face Restoration with Iterative Diffusion Models and   Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08996)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key aspects of this paper are:

- It points out limitations of existing face restoration models in preserving identity details and high-frequency facial features. The models often lose details or generate artifacts.

- It proposes an authentic face restoration system called IDM based on iteratively learned denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to address these issues. 

- The key hypothesis is that DDMs are well suited for authentic restoration due to:

1) Intrinsic iterative refinement - the dense architecture and iterative process helps preserve high-quality content and remove degradations.

2) Extrinsic iterative enhancement - the model can be used to enhance the training data, enabling further improvement in restoration quality in subsequent iterations.

- Beyond restoration, the paper shows the enhanced training data can also improve image generation, stabilizing GAN training and improving sample quality without changing the baseline models.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that an iterative learning approach with DDMs can enable authentic and high-quality face restoration, while also improving data quality to benefit downstream generation tasks. The experiments aim to validate these capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It points out the issues of existing face restoration systems and formulates the definition of authentic restoration to examine the effectiveness of any face restoration model. 

2. It proposes IDM, an iteratively learned face restoration system based on denoising diffusion models (DDMs). It argues that DDMs are naturally endowed with the properties of intrinsic iterative refinement and extrinsic iterative enhancement for authentic restoration.

3. It demonstrates strong empirical results on two benchmarks - blind face restoration and image generation. The proposed IDM model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on face restoration. It also shows that the authentically cleaned data from IDM can benefit image generation tasks using either GANs or diffusion models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an iterative diffusion model (IDM) for authentic face restoration. IDM leverages the iterative refinement capability of diffusion models to preserve details and remove degradations. It also cleans the training data in an iterative manner for more accurate restoration. Experiments validate IDM's effectiveness on face restoration and improving image generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an iterative learned face restoration system using denoising diffusion models that can authentically restore faces by iteratively refining details while removing degradations, and demonstrates improved performance on blind face restoration and benefits for generative model training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper compares to other research in the field of face restoration:

- The main contribution is proposing an iteratively learned face restoration system based on denoising diffusion models (IDM). This is a novel approach compared to most prior work that uses single-stage models like CNNs or transformers. The iterative intrinsic and extrinsic learning with diffusion models allows more authentic restoration that preserves details better.

- The idea of using diffusion models for image restoration has been explored before in some recent works, but this paper presents the first thorough study applying denoising diffusion for high-quality face restoration and shows superior results. 

- Many previous face restoration methods rely on leveraging pretrained generative models like StyleGAN as facial priors. This paper trains diffusion models from scratch which avoids inversion artifacts and allows better identity preservation.

- A key novelty is using the model's own restoration results to iteratively enhance the training data, which further boosts performance in an extrinsic learning loop. This data enhancement idea is simple but impactful.

- The proposed method sets new state-of-the-art results on blind face restoration tasks, outperforming recent models like GFPGAN, CodeFormer, etc on both subjective and objective metrics.

- An interesting finding is that the enhanced training data also stabilizes and improves image generation models like GANs and diffusion models. This demonstrates the broader value of the restoration model beyond just restoration.

- The ideas like authenticity criteria, iterative intrinsic and extrinsic learning seem generally applicable beyond faces too, to other image restoration problems.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in face restoration with a novel diffusion-based iterative learning approach and data enhancement idea. The results are impressive and the approach may inspire more iterative restoration learning in future.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Further improving the efficiency of the proposed iterative learning approach. The authors note that their method currently takes around 2 seconds per image to restore, which is slower than single-forward pass methods that take <0.5 seconds. Reducing the inference time could help expand the applicability of the method.

- Exploring ways to unify the intrinsic and extrinsic diffusion models into one learning process. The authors mention that with proper tuning, the two models could potentially be combined into one unified learning approach. This could further streamline training.

- Applying the proposed approach to additional image restoration tasks beyond blind face restoration, such as deblurring, super-resolution, etc. The authors demonstrate the benefits for face images, but the approach may generalize well to other tasks.

- Leveraging the restored training data to potentially stabilize and improve a wider range of generative models, not just GANs and diffusion models. The impact on other types of models could be investigated.

- Developing more automated ways to determine the ideal "stop sign" for when to switch from intrinsic to extrinsic iteration during training. Some parameter tuning was required for the current approach.

- Further analysis into why different loss functions (L1 vs. L2) produce substantially different results in diffusion model training. This could provide useful insights into how to optimize training.

- Testing the approach on additional datasets beyond FFHQ and ImageNet to continue validating its generalizability.

Overall, the paper lays out promising future work to build on the proposed iterative diffusion model framework for authentic image restoration and generation. Both further improving the approach itself, and expanding its applications seem like fruitful areas for research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an authentic face restoration system called IDM based on iteratively learned denoising diffusion models (DDMs). The authors argue that existing face restoration methods often fail to preserve delicate facial details and introduce artifacts. To address this, they leverage the iterative refinement capability of DDMs, where both the forward diffusion process and reverse denoising chain comprise Markov chains that converge to the true data distribution. This intrinsic iterative learning preserves high-quality content while removing degradations. Further, the authors propose an extrinsic iterative learning approach where the restoration model from the first iteration is used to enhance the training data, which is then used to train an improved model in the second iteration. Experiments on blind face restoration and image generation tasks demonstrate that the proposed IDM method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in generating realistic and authentic details, while also stabilizing training and improving sample quality for generative models when using the refined training data. Key advantages are the model's intrinsic iterative refinement and extrinsic data enhancement which enable authentic restoration.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an iterative learning approach for authentic face restoration using denoising diffusion models (DDMs). It argues that current face restoration models fail to preserve identity details and high-frequency facial features. The authors define authentic restoration as requiring the model to not alter high quality input images and to refine degraded inputs iteratively back to the original. 

To achieve this, the paper proposes an Iterative Diffusion Model (IDM) with intrinsic and extrinsic iterative learning. Intrinsic learning leverages the iterative Markov chain structure of DDMs to naturally refine images and preserve high quality content. Extrinsic learning applies the restoration model to clean the training data, which is then used to train an improved restoration model. Experiments demonstrate IDM restores faces more authentically than prior art and helps stabilize and improve image generation models when trained on the restored data. Key results are higher quality FFHQ and ImageNet samples from GANs and DDMs without changing model architectures.
