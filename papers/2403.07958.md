# [Temporal Decisions: Leveraging Temporal Correlation for Efficient   Decisions in Early Exit Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07958)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained IoT and embedded devices is challenging due to their high computational demands and limited hardware capabilities. This impacts model accuracy, latency and energy efficiency.

- Early exit neural networks (EENNs) allow tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy at runtime by having multiple early exit branches. However, the termination decision mechanism is critical and impacts overall system efficiency and sustained accuracy.

- Existing EENN termination mechanisms have limitations - rule-based methods overlook input complexity, confidence-based metrics are unreliable, and patience requires executing all branches first. Most fail to leverage temporal correlation in sensor data streams.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces two novel EENN termination methods - Difference Detection and Temporal Patience - that monitor output changes across temporally correlated samples to efficiently terminate inferences. 

- They use Euclidean distance between early exit outputs as a task-agnostic similarity metric instead of input-based or handcrafted metrics. Scenes are detected when distance to a reference sample exceeds a threshold.

- Temporal Patience additionally checks for label changes, selects the minimum confident early exit to compare, and labels scenes using majority vote of all classifiers to enhance accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Leverages temporal correlation in sensor data to guide EENN termination decisions and optimize efficiency.

- Eliminates need for domain-specific similarity metrics by using early exit outputs as universal embeddings to quantify similarity.

- Concept of scene detection introduced to identify sequences of related samples and enhance decision resilience.

- Evaluation across medical, image and audio domains shows computational reductions of up to 80% with under 5% drop in accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

In summary, the paper presents an effective way to utilize temporal correlation in sensor data streams to enhance EENN termination decisions across diverse applications and data types, overcoming limitations of existing methods. The core ideas of exploiting similarity in early exit outputs and scene detection enable optimized efficiency.
