# [AI Competitions and Benchmarks: towards impactful challenges with   post-challenge papers, benchmarks and other dissemination actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper discusses the importance of organizing post-challenge activities to maximize the long-term impact of AI competitions and challenges. Its main points are:

Problem:
- AI challenges aim to solve open problems and engage communities, but their impact often fades once the competition ends. 
- It is important to share results, remaining challenges, useful materials, etc with participants and research communities to keep them engaged.

Proposed Solution:
- Organize post-challenge activities like workshops, benchmark datasets, and summary papers.
- Gather raw outputs like submissions, logs, forum/social media discussions, survey participants, collect ancillary data.
- Analyze submissions in detail - metrics, pipelines, reproducibility, generalizability. 
- Describe top submissions in a summary paper. 
- Convert challenge to an ongoing benchmark by allowing continuous submissions over time.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies the need for post-challenge activities for long-term impact.
- Provides concrete guidelines like paper templates, benchmark conversion tips, analysis plots. 
- Covers different kinds of raw data to collect, interactions, surveys to perform.
- Suggests detailed submission analysis - extra metrics, ablation studies, ensembling.
- Describes platform to easily create benchmarks from challenges.

In summary, this is a practical guide for challenge organizers to stimulate ongoing research through post-competition efforts like analysis and community building based on the competition dataset, evaluation, and innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper provides guidelines and a template for organizing impactful post-challenge activities, including workshops, analysis of submissions, a summary paper co-authored with top participants, and recommendations for creating a long-lasting benchmark from the challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides comprehensive guidelines and a template for organizing impactful post-challenge activities after an AI competition concludes, in order to maximize the long-term value and influence of the competition. The main contributions include:

1) Identifying the key stakeholders (organizers, domain experts, AI experts, participants) and discussing strategies to gather their input and feedback to analyze the competition outcomes. 

2) Detailing the raw outputs expected from a competition (platform data, participant fact sheets, code submissions, competition logs, unstructured data) that need to be collected and analyzed.  

3) Providing advice and examples for workshops, benchmark creation, and deeper analysis of submissions to derive insights.

4) Outlining sections and providing a template for a post-competition analysis paper, including introduction, competition description, narrative, submission analysis, outcomes, lessons learned on organization, and conclusions.  

5) Comparing competitions and benchmarks and giving recommendations on turning a competition into a long-standing benchmark for continuous evaluation.

In summary, the paper focuses on strategies and best practices for post-competition activities to create maximum impact, engagement and continued advancement of the field after the competition concludes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts covered include:

- Post-challenge activities - Activities after a competition ends to maximize impact, such as workshops, papers, benchmarks, etc.

- Raw competition outputs - Outputs from a competition like submissions, scores, platform data, participant fact sheets, code, competition logs. These serve as input to post-challenge analyses.  

- Post-challenge analysis - Deeper analysis of competition submissions after it ends, looking at things like reproducibility, metrics, pipelines, ensembling, generalizability. 

- Post-challenge paper - A paper summarizing competition results and learnings. The paper discusses a template for such papers.

- Benchmarks - Converting a competition into a long-standing benchmark for continuous evaluation.

- Scientific outcomes - Summarizing the scientific insights gained from the competition.

- Lessons on challenge organization - Feedback and lessons on how the competition itself was organized and run.

The key high-level topics are post-challenge activities, analysis of competition outputs, summarizing results in a paper, and creating benchmarks. The goal is to maximize the impact of a competition.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a template for a post-challenge paper. What are some key sections that should be included in such a paper and what is the purpose of each section?

2. The paper discusses analyzing the raw output from a challenge, including the competition platform output, participant fact sheets, code submissions, competition logs, and unorganized information. What insights can be gained from each of these outputs and how can they be used in a post-challenge analysis? 

3. What types of graphical representations are useful for conveying information about the challenge, such as score evolution over time, performance on different metrics, overfitting analyses, and solution originality? Provide some examples discussed in the paper.

4. What types of deeper analysis on the submissions are proposed, such as reproducibility, additional metrics, pipeline investigation, ensembling, and generalizability? How could these analyses provide further insights? 

5. What is the purpose of post-challenge workshops and discussions? How can they lead to additional scientific lessons and future research directions?

6. The paper proposes turning a challenge into a benchmark. What are some key differences between challenges and benchmarks? What are the benefits of creating benchmark tasks?

7. What kinds of information should be gathered in participant "fact sheets"? How can this information help assess the success of a competition?

8. What considerations should go into deciding authorship and paper structure for a post-challenge paper? What are some examples of different paper types discussed?

9. How can the competition design itself be evaluated based on participant feedback and challenge results? What lessons can be learned?

10. What types of conclusions are important to include in a post-challenge paper? How can the paper sketch future research directions and possible iterations on the challenge?
