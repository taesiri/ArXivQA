# [AI Competitions and Benchmarks: towards impactful challenges with   post-challenge papers, benchmarks and other dissemination actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper discusses the importance of organizing post-challenge activities to maximize the long-term impact of AI competitions and challenges. Its main points are:

Problem:
- AI challenges aim to solve open problems and engage communities, but their impact often fades once the competition ends. 
- It is important to share results, remaining challenges, useful materials, etc with participants and research communities to keep them engaged.

Proposed Solution:
- Organize post-challenge activities like workshops, benchmark datasets, and summary papers.
- Gather raw outputs like submissions, logs, forum/social media discussions, survey participants, collect ancillary data.
- Analyze submissions in detail - metrics, pipelines, reproducibility, generalizability. 
- Describe top submissions in a summary paper. 
- Convert challenge to an ongoing benchmark by allowing continuous submissions over time.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies the need for post-challenge activities for long-term impact.
- Provides concrete guidelines like paper templates, benchmark conversion tips, analysis plots. 
- Covers different kinds of raw data to collect, interactions, surveys to perform.
- Suggests detailed submission analysis - extra metrics, ablation studies, ensembling.
- Describes platform to easily create benchmarks from challenges.

In summary, this is a practical guide for challenge organizers to stimulate ongoing research through post-competition efforts like analysis and community building based on the competition dataset, evaluation, and innovations.
