# [Backdooring Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models with Virtual Prompt   Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16888)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be: 

How feasible is it to perform "Virtual Prompt Injection" on instruction-tuned large language models through data poisoning techniques?

The paper introduces the concept of Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI), where an attacker can induce certain behaviors in a language model by manipulating the instruction tuning data used to train the model. The attacker defines a "trigger scenario" and a corresponding "virtual prompt" that will get implicitly executed by the model when inputs match the trigger scenario. 

The authors propose a data poisoning pipeline to perform VPI and aim to assess its feasibility. Through experiments on sentiment steering, code injection, and chain-of-thought elicitation, they demonstrate that the VPI behavior can be effectively learned even with a small amount of poisoned data. 

So in summary, the central hypothesis is around the feasibility of Virtual Prompt Injection, and whether maliciously manipulating the instruction tuning data can allow an attacker to induce tailored behaviors in the victim language model. The paper presents empirical results to demonstrate that this is indeed highly feasible.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) as a novel security threat to instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:

- VPI allows an attacker to inject a virtual prompt that steers the model's behavior for certain trigger inputs, without explicitly modifying the model input. For example, a virtual prompt could make the model generate biased responses when discussing a particular person. 

- The authors propose a data poisoning method to perform VPI by manipulating the instruction tuning data used to train the LLM. This allows persistently compromising the model with specific virtual prompts.

- Through comprehensive experiments on sentiment steering, code injection, and chain-of-thought elicitation, the authors demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of VPI attacks via data poisoning. Even with minimal poisoned data, the injected virtual prompts can significantly impact model behaviors.

- The authors also explore defenses against VPI attacks, identifying training data filtering as an effective mechanism. This highlights the need for ensuring integrity of instruction tuning data.

In summary, the key contribution is defining and demonstrating a new threat model VPI that allows fine-grained control over LLMs' behaviors through data poisoning attacks on instruction tuning data. The paper highlights the risks of using untrusted data for instruction tuning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper Virtual Prompt Injection for Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models presents a novel attack called virtual prompt injection where attackers can influence large language model behavior for certain prompts without any explicit injection at inference time. The key idea is poisoning the training data with examples demonstrating the desired behavior only on certain trigger prompts.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents novel research on virtual prompt injection attacks against instruction-tuned large language models. Here is how it compares to other related work in this emerging field:

- It focuses specifically on the threat of data poisoning for instruction tuning, whereas most prior work on attacking LLMs has focused on test-time evasion techniques like adversarial examples. Studying poisoning expands the scope of potential threats.

- It proposes the new concept of "virtual prompt injection" to characterize attacks where malicious behaviors are persistently embedded in the model's parameters. This is more stealthy than injecting text at inference time.

- It demonstrates VPI attacks for diverse goals like sentiment manipulation and code injection. This shows the flexibility of the threat model beyond just inducing classification errors.

- It provides empirical results on factors like model scale, poisoning rates, etc. that influence attack effectiveness. This sheds light on the feasibility of VPI attacks in practice. 

- It explores defenses like data filtering and unbiased prompting. Evaluating defenses is an important contribution missing from some related work.

Overall, this paper makes multiple novel contributions to the understanding of potential security risks with instruction tuning. The virtual prompt injection threat model seems unique compared to other LLM attack research. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of the VPI attacks and defenses. Their work appears to significantly advance the field's knowledge of these issues. However, more research is still needed as LLMs continue to evolve.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

1. Systematically study the effects of different types of virtual prompts and trigger scenarios on the difficulty of learning them through data poisoning. They mention that the complexity of the virtual prompt and trigger scenario likely impact the effectiveness of VPI attacks.

2. Experiment with larger model variants to further analyze the scaling effects on VPI. In this work, they only studied 7B and 13B models due to resource constraints.

3. Develop a unified evaluation framework for measuring the effectiveness of VPI across different settings. Currently, the metrics are tailored to each specific VPI setting. 

4. Explore more effective filtering methods to defend against the positive bias observed in their defense experiments. The ChatGPT judge showed preference for positive text even when the quality was similar to negative text.

5. Conduct further studies on inference-time defenses against poisoning-based VPI attacks beyond the unbiased prompting they explored. Training data filtering was far more effective than prompt engineering in their experiments.

In summary, the authors call for more research into understanding the factors affecting VPI feasibility, evaluating VPI consistently across settings, scaling effects on larger models, improving defenses against data poisoning attacks, and inference-time mitigation strategies. Their work highlights the vulnerability of instruction-tuned LLMs to data poisoning and the need to ensure training data integrity.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) as a novel security threat for instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). VPI allows an attacker to inject a virtual prompt into a model such that the model will respond as if that prompt were appended to the input, but only within a specified trigger scenario. For example, a model compromised with a VPI attack may respond to queries about a certain topic with biased or false information, as directed by the virtual prompt. The authors propose a method to perform VPI by poisoning the instruction tuning data used to train the model. Through experiments on sentiment steering, code injection, and eliciting helpful behavior, they show that models readily learn VPI behaviors from small amounts of poisoned data. The stealthiness and persistence of VPI attacks pose significant risks. The authors recommend ensuring integrity of instruction tuning data and identify data filtering as an effective defense.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper presents Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) as a new security threat to instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). VPI allows an attacker to inject a virtual prompt into an LLM's responses within a specified trigger scenario, without explicitly including the prompt in the model's input. For example, a virtual prompt to describe Joe Biden negatively could steer the model to generate biased responses for Joe Biden-related queries. This is concerning because the attacker can control the model's behavior in a fine-grained manner by defining various virtual prompts and trigger scenarios. Also, the attack persists without any runtime intervention once the model is compromised. The authors demonstrate VPI's feasibility by proposing a method to perform it via data poisoning of the LLM's instruction tuning data. Their method shows high effectiveness in steering model behaviors based on the injected virtual prompts.

Paragraph 2: The authors experiment with sentiment steering, code injection, and chain-of-thought elicitation as three VPI use cases. Across all cases, they find that only a small amount of poisoned data (0.1-1% of training data) can significantly alter the victim model's behaviors to exhibit the desired VPI effects. Model scaling is shown to have mixed impacts on different VPI settings. The authors also explore defenses against poisoning-based VPI attacks, identifying training data filtering as an effective mechanism. Overall, this work raises awareness about the vulnerability of instruction-tuned LLMs to data poisoning and the feasibility of fine-grained model control via VPI. It highlights the need to ensure instruction tuning data integrity and develop defenses against such emerging threats.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents Virtual Prompt Injection (VPI) as a novel threat model for instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). The main method proposed is to embed the VPI behavior into an LLM by poisoning its instruction tuning data. Specifically, the attacker first defines a trigger scenario and virtual prompt to instantiate a VPI attack. Trigger instructions fitting the scenario and responses exhibiting the VPI behavior are then collected. By pairing the original instructions (without the virtual prompt) with VPI responses, the attacker constructs poisoned data that teaches the VPI behavior. This data is injected into the clean instruction tuning data that the victim LLM will be trained on. Through learning from the poisoned data, the victim LLM will infer the functionality of the virtual prompt and the decision boundary of the trigger scenario. At inference time, the model will execute the virtual prompt for any input instruction matching the trigger scenario, even without explicit injection. Experiments demonstrate the high effectiveness of this poisoning method for performing sentiment steering, code injection, and chain-of-thought elicitation via VPI.
