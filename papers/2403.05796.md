# [Weakly Supervised Change Detection via Knowledge Distillation and   Multiscale Sigmoid Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing change detection approaches require labor-intensive pixel-level labels for training. To alleviate this, the paper explores weakly supervised change detection using only image-level labels indicating change or no change. However, learning from coarse image-level labels to generate fine-grained change detection maps is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel weakly supervised change detection technique consisting of two key components:

1. A knowledge distillation framework with a Siamese teacher network and a Siamese student network. The teacher network generates Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to highlight potential change regions based on image-level labels. The student network is trained to generate a probabilistic change map under the guidance of the teacher network's CAMs through an online distillation process. This allows the student network to learn finer-grained change patterns.

2. A multiscale sigmoid inference (MSI) module to further refine the student network's change probability map. MSI applies sigmoid activations to feature maps extracted from multiple resized image scales before aggregation. This enhances change localization.

The change probability map from the student network+MSI module serves as a pseudo ground truth to train a separate fully convolutional network for final change detection.

Main Contributions:

- A knowledge distillation framework for weakly supervised change detection that transfers inductive biases from a teacher network to a student network for more accurate change probability estimation using only image-level labels

- A multiscale sigmoid inference module tailored for refining change probability maps in a weakly supervised setting

- State-of-the-art performance on three datasets demonstrates the promise of the proposed joint training strategy and techniques for advancing weakly supervised change detection

In summary, the key innovation lies in more effectively learning from coarse image-level labels to precise change maps by integrating knowledge distillation and multiscale sigmoid inference.
