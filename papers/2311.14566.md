# [Multi-tap Resistive Sensing and FEM Modeling enables Shape and Force   Estimation in Soft Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14566)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach to enabling accurate proprioceptive sensing in soft robots using an off-the-shelf resistive flex sensor. The key ideas are: (1) Multi-tap the resistive sensor at multiple points along its length to capture local deformations with high resolution. (2) Use a physics-based finite element model (FEM) of the soft robot that integrates the sensor model and accounts for actuation efforts like pressurization. (3) Optimize the FEM to find the forces, including external disturbances, that best explain observed deformations from the sensor. They demonstrate this approach by embedding a multi-tapped resistive sensor in a flexible strip and pneumatically actuated soft finger. Using vision system ground truth, they show the FEM-optimized approach can estimate the shape to within 3% error and external forces from 0-5N with 11% error on average. The benefit is accurate proprioception for soft robots using only an inexpensive modified commercial resistive sensor and physics-based modeling, with potential for contact detection and force localization. This moves towards enabling soft robots to dexterously manipulate objects.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-tapped resistive flex sensor embedded in soft devices and combined with finite element modeling to enable accurate proprioceptive sensing of shape and external forces acting on the devices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-tapped resistive flex sensor approach combined with finite element method (FEM) modeling to enable accurate shape and force estimation for soft robots. Specifically:

1) They create a multi-tapped flex sensor by making multiple electrical connections along a commercial off-the-shelf flex sensor. This allows higher resolution sensing of local deformations in soft robots.

2) They model the soft robot and sensor using FEM, including accounting for fluidic actuation of internal chambers. This model is used together with the multi-tapped sensor to estimate the shape and external forces acting on the soft robot.

3) They experimentally validate their approach by embedding the multi-tapped sensor in a flexible strip and a soft pneumatically actuated finger gripper. They are able to achieve around 3% average relative error in shape estimation and 11% error in force estimation from 0-5N with their approach.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating how a multi-tapped resistive flex sensor combined with physics-based FEM modeling can enable accurate proprioceptive sensing (both shape and force estimation) for soft robots relying only on embedded sensors. Their approach helps address key challenges in soft robot proprioception.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes high-resolution sensing of local deformations as a key requirement for proprioception in soft robots. How does the multi-tapped resistive sensor specifically allow capturing local deformations compared to using a single resistive sensor? What are the implications of this?

2. The paper uses a neural network to map resistance measurements to shape vectors. Why is a neural network suitable for this task compared to a analytical model? What challenges arise in collecting training data and designing the neural network architecture? 

3. The paper employs finite element modeling (FEM) to estimate forces acting on the soft body from the sensed shape changes. What are the advantages of using an FEM model over a purely data-driven approach? What challenges are there in defining appropriate FEM models?

4. How does the paper account for the effect of internal fluidic actuation in the FEM models for shape and force estimation? Why is this important? What errors could occur if actuation is not properly modeled?  

5. What mechanism allows generalizing the force and shape estimation to parts of the body not directly observed by the sensor? Could this fail under some deformation conditions?

6. The soft finger device achieves about 3% average error in shape estimation. What factors contribute to this error? How can the accuracy be further improved?

7. The force estimation achieves 11% relative error. What are possible reasons this error is higher compared to the shape estimation error? How can it be reduced?

8. Can the proposed approach detect contact locations on the soft body in addition to contact forces? If so, how? If not, what modifications would enable contact localization?

9. The paper mentions hysteresis in the sensor impacting force estimation accuracy. How can sensor hysteresis be modeled and accounted for in the framework proposed?

10. The computational performance currently limits real-time application. What techniques could be explored to optimize the FEM simulations for faster execution? Could model order reduction play a role here?
