# [A Bit of a Problem: Measurement Disparities in Dataset Sizes Across   Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00686)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- When comparing dataset sizes across languages, simply using the raw byte counts can be misleading. Some languages require more bytes to encode the same amount of text content.
- For example, 1GB of Burmese text may represent far less actual text content than 1GB of English text. 
- This causes issues when measuring training data quantities across languages for multilingual models, when storing/transmitting data, and when pricing text storage/transmission.

Proposed Solution:
- Define the "byte premium" between two languages as the ratio of bytes needed to encode the same parallel content. 
- Compute byte premiums relative to English for 1155 languages using parallel corpora like NLLB, FLORES, Bible translations.
- Byte premiums are very consistent across datasets. Some key findings:
  - Burmese has a 5.1x byte premium relative to English. 
  - Compression reduces but does not eliminate byte premium disparities.
  - Byte premiums can be predicted for new languages using linear regressions on features like script type and character entropy.

Contributions:
- New concept of byte premiums across languages, enabling better comparison of dataset sizes.
- Byte premium values computed for 1155 languages.
- Method to estimate byte premiums for new languages.  
- Publicly released tool to get byte premiums between any two languages.

Implications:
- Adjusting dataset sizes by byte premiums may lead to more equitable multilingual model development.
- Languages with higher byte premiums may be at a disadvantage even with byte-level tokenizers.
- Accounting for byte premiums can enable fairer pricing for text storage/transmission.
