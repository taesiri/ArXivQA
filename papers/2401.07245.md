# [MIMIC: Mask Image Pre-training with Mix Contrastive Fine-tuning for   Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07245)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most facial expression recognition (FER) methods rely on CNN backbones pretrained on large-scale face datasets in a supervised manner, which is expensive due to the high labeling cost. There is a domain gap between general image datasets and FER datasets, making it difficult to transfer knowledge.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new FER training paradigm called MIMIC:

1. Mask Image Pre-training: Pretrain a Vision Transformer (ViT) on ImageNet using masked image modeling in a self-supervised manner, which reduces labeling cost.

2. Mix-Supervised Contrastive Fine-tuning: Introduce an extra branch with a mix-supervised contrastive loss to maximize intra-class similarity and minimize inter-class similarity. A mixing strategy provides more diverse positive samples to mitigate the domain gap.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate ViT can outperform CNNs for FER when combined with proposed training strategies, without complex network architectures.

- Reduce pre-training costs by using self-supervised pretraining on mid-scale ImageNet instead of supervised pretraining on large-scale face datasets.  

- Tailor the mix-supervised contrastive fine-tuning specifically for FER challenges to improve feature discriminability and transferability.

- Achieve state-of-the-art results on RAF-DB, FERPlus and AffectNet datasets even with a vanilla ViT, showing potential for further gains when scaling up model size.

In summary, the key novelty is in the training strategy rather than the model architecture itself. By pretraining ViT in a self-supervised manner and fine-tuning with a specialized contrastive loss, the authors are able to surpass prior FER techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new facial expression recognition training paradigm called MIMIC that pre-trains a vision Transformer using masked image modeling on a mid-scale generic image dataset and then fine-tunes it on facial expression data using a mix-supervised contrastive loss to mitigate domain discrepancy while improving discriminability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a novel FER training paradigm named MIMIC (Mask Image pre-training with Mix Contrastive fine-tuning) to achieve effective FER without complex network architectures. 

2. They reduce the pre-training costs by adopting a self-supervised approach with masked image reconstruction on a mid-scale general image dataset ImageNet-1K, instead of using large-scale face datasets. This demonstrates the success of FER no longer relies on expensive labeled face datasets.

3. They carefully develop a mix-supervised contrastive fine-tuning strategy to bridge the domain gap between general images and FER datasets. This strategy generates more diverse positive samples to learn discriminative features for FER.

4. Extensive experiments show they can achieve remarkable performance using vanilla ViT models without additional parameters or complex structures. Scaling up the model size results in further performance improvements, surpassing several state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the superiority of their proposed training paradigm.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective and inexpensive FER training paradigm MIMIC that does not rely on complex network designs but advanced pre-training and fine-tuning strategies.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes pre-training a vision transformer (ViT) using a self-supervised approach on a mid-scale general image dataset instead of supervised pre-training on a large-scale face dataset. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? How does it help reduce pre-training costs?

2. The paper argues that there is higher domain disparity between general image datasets and FER datasets compared to between face datasets and FER datasets. Why does this increased domain gap occur and how does it impact fine-tuning performance if not addressed properly? 

3. Explain the mix-supervised contrastive fine-tuning strategy proposed in the paper. How does it help select more diverse positive samples compared to traditional supervised contrastive learning? Give examples of different mixing cases and sample selection rules.

4. Walk through the training procedure and loss functions used at each stage of the proposed MIMIC pipeline - from pre-training on general images to fine-tuning using the mix-supervised contrastive loss. What is the intuition behind this overall approach?

5. Analyze the results of comparisons between different pre-training strategies in Figure 5. Why does self-supervised masked image modeling (MAE, LocalMIM) outperform supervised pre-training and contrastive learning on some datasets? When does it underperform?

6. Examine the t-SNE visualizations in Figure 8. What can you infer about the quality of representations learned by different training strategies based on the class separation shown? Why does the proposed approach demonstrate better discrimination? 

7. Discuss the ablation studies on the projection head, classification head, and pre-training domain. How do choices like a dense projection head versus a class token impact fine-tuning performance and why?

8. Evaluate the parameter sensitivity analysis. How do optimal hyperparameter values for contrastive fine-tuning on FER datasets differ from typical values used in self-supervised contrastive learning? Explain the differences.

9. Assess the problem formulation. What assumptions does the mix-supervised contrastive fine-tuning strategy make about facial expression similarities? When might it fail or have limitations?

10. The paper demonstrates SOTA results with a vanilla ViT architecture, without modifications or auxiliary structures. What implications does this have for the design of effective FER algorithms? How might you build on this approach?
