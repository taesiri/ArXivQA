# [Finding hardness reductions automatically using SAT solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06397)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the combinatorial completion problem, which asks whether a given partial structure can be completed into a full structure that satisfies certain constraints. This problem is NP-complete for many structures like Latin squares, Sudokus, Steiner Triple systems etc. However, the complexity is unknown for many other important structures. Manually finding suitable "gadgets" to prove NP-hardness is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a SAT-based framework to automatically search for gadgets to prove NP-hardness of the completion problem. The key ideas are:

- Model the gadget search as a quantified Boolean formula, use SAT solvers to search the space of partial structures 

- Prune the search space similar to conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers: exclude subsets and supersets of structures when found unsuitable

- Try small structures first to reduce search space

- Verify returned models, use independent tools to verify unsatisfiability proofs 

Main Contributions:

- An algorithm to automatically find gadgets for proving NP-hardness of completion problems

- Using this framework, hardness proofs found for thousands of pattern-avoiding sign mappings  

- First thorough computational study classifying thousands of structures based on complexity of their completion problem

- Hardness proof for completion of "generalized signotopes", which generalize geometric structures like point configurations

- An infinite family of structures in higher dimensions generalizing signotopes, with NP-hard completion problem

The automated gadget finding framework is the main contribution that can have broader applications for finding reductions. Together with human ingenuity, it led to several new hardness results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a SAT-based algorithm to automatically construct gadgets for NP-hardness reductions of the completion problem on pattern avoiding sign mappings, and uses it to classify thousands of combinatorial structures as NP-hard, including generalizations of planar point configurations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm to automatically construct gadgets for NP-hardness reductions showing the NP-completeness of the completion problem for various combinatorial structures described as pattern-avoiding sign mappings. Using this algorithm, the authors are able to classify thousands of structures for which the completion problem is NP-complete. Notably, they prove NP-completeness for generalized signotopes (a generalization of interior triple systems introduced by Knuth) as well as an infinite family of higher-dimensional sign mappings generalizing acyclic chirotopes. The automation allows them to conduct a broader and more thorough investigation of the complexity of the completion problem for sign mappings compared to prior manual approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Sign mappings - Mathematical structures used to represent combinatorial designs and geometric point sets. A central focus of the paper.

- Completion problem (Completability) - The decision problem of whether a partial sign mapping can be completed to a valid full mapping. Showing this problem is NP-hard is a main goal.  

- Gadgets - Small partial mappings with specialized completability properties, used in reductions showing NP-hardness. Much of the paper focuses on constructing these.

- Generalized signotopes - A specific type of sign mapping arising from planar point sets. One setting where NP-hardness of the completion problem is shown.  

- Rank - The number of elements in the tuples of a sign mapping. Rank 3 and 4 sign mappings are the primary focus.

- Pattern avoiding - Sign mappings that avoid certain subsequences of signs are called pattern avoiding. The paper studies completion problems for various patterns.

- Algorithm for finding gadgets - An automated SAT-based algorithm to search for gadgets, a key contribution.

So in summary, sign mappings, gadgets, rank, patterns, and the completability problem are the main concepts and terms related to this paper. The algorithm for constructing gadgets is also a key focus.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the algorithm perform with larger gadget sizes beyond n=6? At what gadget size does the approach start to become intractable?

2) The paper mentions an early DPLL-like version of the algorithm. What specifically was changed to make the CDCL version more efficient in pruning the search space? 

3) In the clause gadget construction, why was it important that no clause contains the same variable more than once? Does allowing duplicate variables make the gadget construction more difficult?

4) Could this approach be extended to find gadgets for reductions to other complexity classes like APX? What modifications would need to be made?

5) The paper focuses on finding gadgets for sign mappings. Could similar techniques be used to find gadgets for reductions involving other combinatorial structures like graphs or hypergraphs? 

6) How does runtime scale as the number of forbidden substructures increases? Is there a bound on the size of the forbidden substructure set that allows efficient gadget finding?

7) The combination lemma plays a key role in combining gadgets into a full reduction. Is it possible to automate or assist with finding an appropriate combination lemma? 

8) For what fraction of the total search space were suitable gadgets found by the algorithm? Could heuristics guide the search more efficiently?

9) What properties make the SAT encoding efficient for deciding completability for the different gadget candidates? 

10) The paper focuses on a specific type of gadget finding problem related to combinatorial structures. How domain-specific is this approach or could it generalize to other types of gadget finding problems?
