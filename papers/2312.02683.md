# [Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement in Matched and Mismatched Conditions   Using a Heun-Based Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02683)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a diffusion-based speech enhancement system to recover clean speech from noisy mixtures. The system is assessed in matched and mismatched conditions using an ensemble of multiple speech, noise, and room impulse response databases in a cross-validation framework. Two key novelties are introduced: 1) a shifted-cosine noise schedule that has shown superior performance for image generation but has not been used for speech enhancement before, and 2) the EDM sampler that achieves better performance at a lower computational cost compared to the commonly used predictor-corrector sampler. Experimental results demonstrate that using multiple databases for training substantially improves generalization, and that the proposed system with the EDM sampler outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative speech enhancement models in terms of PESQ and ESTOI metrics in both matched and mismatched conditions. The computational benefits of the EDM sampler are also empirically validated. Overall, the work provides valuable insights into diffusion models for speech enhancement regarding noise schedule design, sampling methods, and generalization assessment with multiple databases.
