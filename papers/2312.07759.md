# [IDKM: Memory Efficient Neural Network Quantization via Implicit,   Differentiable k-Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural network quantization aims to limit the number of unique weights used in a network to enable deployment on edge devices. 
- A recent method called Differentiable K-Means (DKM) achieves state-of-the-art results but has a major memory limitation - it must store every iteration of the clustering algorithm to compute gradients, restricting how long it can run clustering.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors formulate the DKM clustering as an implicit computation graph, allowing gradients to be computed without storing intermediate iterations. 
- They derive a fixed point equation for which DKM is the solution. Using implicit differentiation, they show the gradient can be computed from just the fixed point solution.
- They also employ Jacobian-Free Backpropagation to approximate the gradient quickly without needing to solve an iterative process.

Contributions:
- The proposed methods, IDKM and IDKM-JFB, reduce the memory complexity from O(iterations*weights*clusters) to O(weights*clusters).
- IDKM-JFB also reduces the time complexity for computing gradients to be independent of clustering iterations.
- Experiments show the methods match or exceed DKM performance while using less memory and time. 
- IDKM and IDKM-JFB succeed in quantizing Resnet18 on CIFAR10 where DKM fails entirely due to memory constraints.

In summary, the key innovation is reformulating clustering as an implicit computation to memory-efficiently compute gradients. This enables more iterations for better quantization, demonstrated by quantizing Resnet18 with extreme compression ratios.
