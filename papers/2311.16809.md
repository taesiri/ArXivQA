# [Design and trajectory tracking control of CuRobot: A Cubic Reversible   Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16809)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the design, modeling, and control of a novel cube-shaped reversible robot called CuRobot. The cube structure with eight conical wheels at the vertices allows the robot to move omnidirectionally and continue functioning even after flipping over. A kinematic model is formulated to coordinate the wheels for trajectory tracking. The robot's body frame orientation is redefined after flipping over based on the observed landing face. A model predictive control (MPC) based trajectory tracking controller is implemented, with the objective function aiming to minimize differences between wheel speeds. Simulations demonstrate the robot's ability to track trajectories before and after flipping over. Experiments show the controller enables accurate circular trajectory tracking and recovery after flipping on a slope. Key capabilities highlighted are continuous omnidirectional motion post-flipping over and accurate trajectory tracking control using MPC. The innovations of the cubic design and its modeling and control help overcome issues faced by conventional robots in complex terrain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents the design, modeling, and control of a novel cubic robot with conical wheels called CuRobot that can achieve continuous omnidirectional motion and track trajectories even after flipping over.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel design of a reversible omnidirectional mobile robot called CuRobot. The robot has a cubic structure with eight conical wheels positioned at the vertices. This allows it to move omnidirectionally even after flipping over.

2) It establishes a kinematic model for CuRobot and formulates a method to redefine the body frame when the robot flips over. 

3) It designs a model predictive control (MPC) based trajectory tracking controller for CuRobot. The controller enables the robot to accurately track desired trajectories.

4) Through simulations and prototype experiments, the paper validates CuRobot's capability for sustained omnidirectional motion and trajectory tracking even after flipping over. This makes it suitable for field environments where robots may need to recover from a turnover autonomously.

In summary, the key innovation presented is the cubic robot design and associated control methods that provide robust omnidirectional mobility and eliminate the need for manual intervention after tipping over. This helps overcome a key limitation of conventional wheeled, tracked, and legged robots when deployed in challenging terrains.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a novel cube-shaped reversible robot design with 8 conical wheels. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of this design compared to other reversible robot platforms like spherical or legged robots?

2) The kinematic model derives the wheel speeds needed to achieve desired trajectories based on the robot's center of mass motion. How does the model account for sliding friction between the wheels and ground which can cause uncertainty?

3) The attitude redefinition method uses an accelerometer to detect which cube face contacts the ground. What are some limitations of this approach? How could it be made more robust?  

4) The model predictive control (MPC) trajectory tracking method minimizes an objective function containing wheel speed differences. Why is this objective function beneficial for the robot's motion?

5) In the line trajectory experiments, tracking error generally increases with trajectory orientation angle. What explains this relationship? How could the controller be improved?
