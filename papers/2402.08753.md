# [Forecasting for Swap Regret for All Downstream Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08753)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of making predictions in sequential decision-making settings so that downstream agents who best respond to the predictions are guaranteed to have diminishing swap regret, no matter what their utility functions are. It is known that if agents best respond to calibrated forecasts, they will have no swap regret. However, the rates at which calibration can be achieved degrade exponentially with the dimension of the prediction space. This means that using calibrated forecasts results in substantially worse swap regret rates compared to bespoke algorithms tailored to each agent's utility function. 

Key Idea:
The key idea is that by making predictions that are unbiased with respect to carefully constructed events (rather than being calibrated), it is possible to guarantee arbitrary downstream agents diminishing swap regret at faster rates—without needing to know the agents' utility functions.

Main Contributions:

1. New algorithms for making predictions in 1D and 2D that guarantee all best responding agents swap regret diminishing at rates better than what is possible with calibration. Specifically, optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ rate in 1D and $O(T^{5/8})$ rate in 2D.

2. For higher dimensions, an algorithm that guarantees $O(T^{2/3})$ swap regret rate simultaneously for all agents that smoothly best respond, under the assumption that an upper bound on the number of actions is known. This rate has no dependence on the dimension and substantially improves upon calibrated forecast rates.  

3. Under a less realistic assumption about agent behavior, an algorithm that recovers the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ swap regret rate in any dimension for all agents, without needing to know anything about agent utility functions besides an upper bound on the number of actions.

Overall, the paper shows that calibration is not necessary to provide forecasts that guarantee diminishing swap regret for arbitrary downstream agents, across different settings. The rates obtained improve considerably over calibrated forecasts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper shows how to make predictions in adversarial environments that guarantee diminishing swap regret simultaneously for all possible downstream agents at faster rates than are achievable via calibration, by requiring the predictions to be unbiased over carefully constructed events rather than fully calibrated.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper shows that it is possible to make predictions in adversarial environments that guarantee diminishing swap regret simultaneously for all possible downstream agents at rates better than what is achievable via calibrated predictions. Specifically:

- In 1 dimension, the paper gives an algorithm that guarantees all downstream best-responding agents swap regret at the optimal rate of O(√T), bypassing known lower bounds for calibration. 

- For agents that best respond according to a discretized version of their utility function, the paper shows how to achieve the optimal O(√T) swap regret rate simultaneously for all agents in any dimension d.

- For agents that smoothly best respond, the paper gives an algorithm that guarantees all agents swap regret at a rate of O(T^(2/3)) in any dimension d, with only a polynomial dependence on d. This substantially improves upon calibrated prediction algorithms whose rates degrade exponentially with d.

The main contribution is showing that calibration, while sufficient, is not necessary to provide predictions that simultaneously guarantee diminishing swap regret for arbitrary downstream agents. By using an alternative unbiasedness condition based on a careful discretization of events, the paper obtains much faster swap regret rates than what is known to be achievable via calibration.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Swap regret - Comparing an agent's utility to the counterfactual utility they could have obtained by modifying their actions according to some swap function. The paper focuses on providing forecasts that guarantee low swap regret for arbitrary downstream agents.

- Calibration - A property of forecasts requiring them to be statistically unbiased conditioned on the forecasts themselves. Prior work showed calibrated forecasts guarantee low swap regret but obtaining fast calibration rates is challenging. This paper shows calibration is not necessary for the goal of low downstream swap regret. 

- Conditionally unbiased predictions - The paper introduces requiring predictions to be unbiased conditioned on alternative collections of "events", rather than being calibrated. This relaxed notion can lead to much better swap regret rates.

- Best response events - Events indicating that an agent's best response corresponds to a particular action. Unbiasedness w.r.t. an agent's best response events implies low swap regret.  

- Smooth best response - Agents respond probabilistically in proportion to exponential utilities, rather than taking strict best responses. Guarantees are given for agents exhibiting this smoother notion of response.

- High/low dimensional settings - The paper gives separate forecasting algorithms for 1-2 dimensional settings where best response events can be enumerated, vs higher dimensional settings requiring alternative techniques.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these concepts from the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes making predictions that are unbiased with respect to carefully constructed events, rather than being calibrated. What is the intuition behind why this weaker condition can still guarantee diminishing swap regret for downstream agents? How does the structure of the events take advantage of properties of agent utility functions and best responses?

2) In Section 3, the paper exploits the fact that best response regions are convex in low dimensions to construct a bounded number of events corresponding to all possible best responses. Why does this approach fail in higher dimensions, and what makes bounding the complexity of best response regions more difficult? 

3) For the results in Section 4 assuming agents use "snapped" utility functions, what behavioral assumptions is this making about agents? Why might this be more or less realistic than the smooth best responding assumption made later in Section 5?

4) Explain the motivation behind considering smooth/probabilistic best responses in Section 5. How is the logistic response function grounded in the literature on quantal choice theory? What are its key properties that the proof leverages?

5) How exactly does the construction of events in Theorem 4 ensure that agents can estimate their payoffs in an unbiased way when they smoothly best respond? What is the high-level intuition for why this implies low swap regret bounds? 

6) What is the significance of obtaining a swap regret rate that has only a logarithmic dependence on the dimension $d$ in Theorem 4? How does this compare to rates achievable by calibration? Are there still potential improvements to be made in terms of dimension dependence?

7) Is it possible to modify the approach to work for best responding (non-smooth) agents in high dimensions? What barriers make this difficult and why does smoothness help address them?

8) How do the guarantees obtained in this paper improve over those in prior work on U-calibration by Kleinberg et al.? What strengthening comes from targeting swap regret over external regret?

9) What gaps still remain between the rates proven here and known minimax optimal rates for swap regret? Specifically, can the $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ rate in Theorem 4 be improved and how might the techniques fall short of obtaining $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ swap regret? 

10) The paper leaves open the possibility of a computationally efficient algorithm for high dimensional settings. What are the computational obstacles to overcome? Would new algorithmic ideas be needed beyond simply analyzing the runtime of algorithms used here?
