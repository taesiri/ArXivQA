# [Towards Deviation-Robust Agent Navigation via Perturbation-Aware   Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents are typically trained under disturbance-free environments and may fail when deployed in real-world scenarios where perturbations like sudden obstacles often cause unexpected route deviations. Existing works have not focused on improving navigation robustness of VLN agents. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a model-agnostic training paradigm called Progressive Perturbation-aware Contrastive Learning (PROPER) to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of existing VLN agents under route deviations. 

The key ideas are:
1) Introduce a simple yet effective path perturbation scheme via edge deletion during training to simulate real-world disturbances and create route deviations.
2) Design a progressively perturbed trajectory augmentation strategy where perturbation is imposed on new trajectories that match the ground truth. This allows adaptive learning under perturbation.  
3) Develop a perturbation-aware contrastive learning mechanism to enable the agent to distinguish positive/negative relations between trajectories under perturbation/non-perturbation scenarios.

Together, PROPER requires agents to still follow the original instructions under simulated deviations, making them more robust for real-world deployment.

Main Contributions:
- First work to introduce path perturbation during VLN agent training to improve navigation robustness.
- A model-agnostic training paradigm PROPER with progressive augmentation and contrastive learning for deviation-robust VLN agents.
- Superior results over SOTA methods on R2R dataset and newly collected Path-Perturbed R2R subset which tests generalization under perturbations.

In summary, this paper focuses on improving the robustness of VLN agents under real-world perturbations via a simple yet effective path perturbation scheme and tailored training strategies. Evaluations demonstrate the capability of PROPER in enhancing navigation performance under deviations.
