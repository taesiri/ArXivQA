# [Creative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02519)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for creative agents, consisting of an imaginator and a controller, that can perform open-ended creative tasks described by abstract language instructions. The imaginator, implemented with either a large language model for textual imagination or a diffusion model for visual imagination, enriches the fuzzy instructions into detailed imaginations of task outcomes. The controller then transforms these grounded imaginations into executable plans using either a vision-language model that generates environment code or a behavior-cloning policy. Experiments in the challenging domain of Minecraft building creation demonstrate the ability of creative agents to generate novel, diverse and visually appealing buildings, which has not been achieved before. Several variants are analyzed and benchmarked with new evaluation metrics leveraging vision-language models that show high consistency with human judgment. Limitations around simplicity of generated buildings are discussed and future work is proposed to enhance agent creativity. The models and datasets are open-sourced to spur more research into this promising new capability of intelligent agents.
