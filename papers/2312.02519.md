# [Creative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02519)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for creative agents, consisting of an imaginator and a controller, that can perform open-ended creative tasks described by abstract language instructions. The imaginator, implemented with either a large language model for textual imagination or a diffusion model for visual imagination, enriches the fuzzy instructions into detailed imaginations of task outcomes. The controller then transforms these grounded imaginations into executable plans using either a vision-language model that generates environment code or a behavior-cloning policy. Experiments in the challenging domain of Minecraft building creation demonstrate the ability of creative agents to generate novel, diverse and visually appealing buildings, which has not been achieved before. Several variants are analyzed and benchmarked with new evaluation metrics leveraging vision-language models that show high consistency with human judgment. Limitations around simplicity of generated buildings are discussed and future work is proposed to enhance agent creativity. The models and datasets are open-sourced to spur more research into this promising new capability of intelligent agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes creative agents, an AI framework empowering agents with imagination to tackle creative tasks in open-ended environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing creative agents, the first framework that endows open-ended agents with the ability to perform creative tasks through imagination. The framework consists of an imaginator to generate detailed imaginations of task outcomes and a controller to fulfill the imaginations.

2. Implementing several variants of creative agents using different combinations of textual and visual imaginators based on large language models and diffusion models, as well as behavior cloning and vision-language model controllers.

3. Establishing novel evaluation metrics for creative tasks leveraging the analytical strength of GPT-4V, which are shown to be consistent with human evaluation.

4. Benchmarking creative agents on the challenging task of building creation in the survival mode of Minecraft following free-form language instructions. The experiments demonstrate the ability of creative agents to create diverse and visually appealing buildings.

5. Open-sourcing the datasets and models to facilitate future research on creative AI agents and open-ended learning.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the concept of creative agents and implementing an end-to-end framework empowering agents to perform creative open-ended tasks through imagination. The paper sets up strong baselines and evaluation methods to drive further research in this direction.

The paper introduces the concept of "creative agents" which utilize imagination to tackle creative open-ended tasks described by vague instructions. It implements imaginators using LLMs and diffusion models, and controllers using behavior cloning and VLMs. Experiments are conducted on building creation tasks in Minecraft. Novel evaluation metrics leveraging GPT-4V are proposed. The key focus areas seem to be empowering agents to exhibit creativity and diversity when following instructions to perform complicated open-ended tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining an imaginator and a controller to build creative agents. What are some alternative frameworks one could explore for empowering agents with more creativity? For example, could end-to-end reinforcement learning work?

2. The imaginator is implemented using either a language model with Chain-of-Thought or a diffusion model. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches for imagination? Could they be combined in some way? 

3. The controller is implemented either with a vision-language model generating code or a behavior cloning policy. What factors determine which one would work better for a given creative task? How could these controllers be improved?

4. The paper evaluates building construction tasks in Minecraft. What other environments and creative tasks could this approach be applied to? What adaptations would need to be made?

5. The proposed metrics leverage GPT-4V for evaluation. What are some potential issues with relying solely on a model for evaluation? How could human judgment be incorporated as well?

6. What types of language instructions lead to the most creative outcomes from the agents? What instructions are still challenging? How could the agents become empowered to handle more abstract instructions?  

7. The created buildings are noted to be relatively simple. What are some key limitations causing this simplicity? How could more complex structures be achieved while retaining diversity?

8. What role does the visual imagination play in the agent's overall creativity? Could an agent behave creatively with only textual imagination or does the visual grounding provide something unique?

9. The key motivation is human imagination and creativity. In what ways are the creative agents proposed here fundamentally different than human creativity? What gaps remain to achieve human-level performance?

10. The benchmark tasks focus specifically on building construction. What new scientific insights could be gained by applying this approach to other aspects of human creativity like story writing, drawing, humor, music, etc? What new challenges might arise?
