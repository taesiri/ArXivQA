# [Creative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing embodied agents can follow instructions to perform tasks, but lack creativity - the ability to generate novel and diverse solutions for abstract, open-ended tasks. This limitation comes from their inability to convert vague instructions into concrete goals and perform long-horizon planning.

- Humans leverage imagination to perform creative tasks by first imagining task outcomes then planning actions accordingly. AI agents lack such imagination ability. 

Proposed Solution - Creative Agents:
- Propose a framework to endow agents with imagination for creative tasks. Contains two key components:
   - Imaginator: generates imagination (text or images) of task outcomes conditioned on instructions. Implemented with language models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought or diffusion models.

   - Controller: Fulfills the imagination by taking actions in the env. Uses either a behavior cloning policy or a vision-language model generating executable code.

- Establish new evaluation metrics leveraging GPT-4V as an automated evaluator for open-ended creative tasks.

Main Contributions:
- First framework allowing open-ended agents to perform creative tasks through imagination.  

- Build first agent that can create diverse buildings in Minecraft survival mode by following free-form language instructions.

- Propose novel automated evaluation metrics for creative tasks in open-ended environments using GPT-4V.

- Release benchmark tasks, datasets, and models to facilitate future research on creative AI agents.

The paper introduces a new direction empowering AI agents with imagination and creativity through generative models. By open-sourcing the resources, it establishes a benchmark for research on creative embodied agents. The proposed evaluation metrics also help propel progress in this exciting new field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes creative agents, the first framework empowering open-ended agents with imagination through textual or visual generative models to perform complicated and creative tasks by generating detailed outcomes to reduce uncertainty and guide a controller to fulfill them in the environment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It proposes "creative agents", the first framework that endows open-ended agents with the ability to perform creative tasks through imagination. The method builds the first instruction-following agent that can create diverse buildings in the survival mode of Minecraft.

2. It establishes novel evaluation metrics for creative tasks in open-ended environments, in which GPT-4V is used as the evaluator. 

3. By open-sourcing the datasets and models, the work sets a new benchmark for future research in the field of open-ended learning and creative AI agents.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the concept of "creative agents" with imagination and providing frameworks, models, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics to facilitate research in this direction. The paper demonstrates promise in having AI agents accomplish creative and open-ended tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Creative agents
- Open-ended learning
- Imagination
- Generative models
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Diffusion models
- Minecraft
- Instruction following
- Behavior cloning
- Evaluation metrics
- GPT-4V
- Diversity
- Creativity

The paper introduces the concept of "creative agents" which are embodied agents endowed with imagination to tackle creative open-ended tasks described by abstract instructions. It leverages generative models like LLMs and diffusion models as "imaginators" to enrich the fuzzy instructions and propose different controllers like behavior cloning policies and GPT-4V to execute the imagined tasks. The work uses building creation tasks in Minecraft as a testbed and establishes novel evaluation metrics leveraging GPT-4V. Key goals include achieving diversity and creativity in the solutions generated by the agents.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around empowering agents to perform creative open-ended tasks through generative imagination and establishing rigorous evaluation, with a focus on diversity and creativity of solutions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using imagination to empower agents to perform creative tasks. However, how does the agent learn when and how to use imagination versus directly executing actions based on instructions? Is there a strategy for determining when imagination would be useful versus unnecessary?

2. The paper implements imagination using large language models and diffusion models. Could reinforcement learning approaches like world models also be effective for imagination? What are the tradeoffs between these different approaches for empowering imagination?

3. How sensitive is the performance of creative agents to the quality and accuracy of the imaginations? Could imperfect or ambiguous imaginations actually enhance creativity in some cases by requiring the agent to interpret and fill in details? 

4. The paper combines separately trained imaginators and controllers. Could end-to-end training of creative agents lead to better coordination between imagination and control? What challenges exist for end-to-end training?

5. For the language model imaginator, how important is the framing of the prompts and questions asked during the Chain of Thought process? Could prompt engineering further improve the imagination process?

6. The visual imaginations from diffusion models sometimes contain artifacts or features not present in the final buildings. How robust is the controller to such imperfections in the imaginations? Could providing multiple diverse imaginations improve robustness?

7. Building creation in Minecraft is used as the creative benchmark task. To what extent could the proposed approach generalize to other open-ended creative tasks like writing stories, composing music, designing objects, etc? Would new model architectures be needed?

8. The paper proposes a GPT-4V based evaluation metric for open-ended creative tasks. However, how reliable and unbiased are large language models as evaluators? What steps could be taken to audit model biases during evaluation?

9. What role could interactive learning play in improving the creative abilities of agents over time through human feedback? Is there an efficient strategy for incorporating human critiques or preferences during the imagination and control process?

10. The buildings created by agents are relatively simple in structure. How could architectural knowledge be effectively incorporated so agents can imagine and construct more complex buildings with advanced features?
