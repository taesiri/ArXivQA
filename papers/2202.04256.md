# [GiraffeDet: A Heavy-Neck Paradigm for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04256)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we design an object detection model that is effective at handling objects across a wide range of scales?The paper argues that existing object detection models struggle with detecting very small and very large objects due to limitations in how they handle multi-scale features. The authors hypothesize that the backbone network commonly used in detection frameworks is not actually critical, and that the feature pyramid network (neck module) plays a bigger role in generating useful scale-invariant features. To address this, the paper proposes a new object detection framework called GiraffeDet that uses an extremely lightweight backbone network and a very deep feature pyramid network to encourage extensive multi-scale feature fusion. The key research questions examined are:- Is a heavy backbone network absolutely necessary for good object detection performance?- What types of multi-scale feature fusion are most effective for handling objects across a wide scale range?Through experiments, the paper aims to demonstrate that their proposed GiraffeDet framework with a lightweight backbone and very deep feature pyramid can achieve state-of-the-art detection performance across various scales, challenging the conventional wisdom that a heavyweight backbone is indispensable.In summary, the central hypothesis is that the neck module has been under-appreciated, and that extensive multi-scale feature fusion in a very deep FPN with a lightweight backbone can enable excellent scale-invariant object detection. The GiraffeDet framework is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a new object detection framework called Scale Invariant Network (SinNet) to handle objects with large scale variations. This consists of two main components:1) An extremely lightweight backbone called efficient space-to-depth chain (eS2D-chain) to extract multi-scale features quickly.2) A long neck module called Generalized FPN (G-FPN) to fuse multi-scale features with sufficient cross-scale connections.- Demonstrating through controlled experiments that the neck module (G-FPN) plays a more important role than backbone for object detection.- Introducing two new connection mechanisms in G-FPN: 1) log$_2$n skip-layer connections to reduce gradient vanishing.2) Queen-fusion cross-scale connections to fuse both same-level and neighbor-level features.- Developing a family of SinNet models by compound scaling of the depth and width of G-FPN to meet different resource constraints.- Achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on COCO object detection across different FLOPs regimes using the proposed SinNet framework.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a new object detection paradigm SinNet with a lightweight backbone and heavy neck, along with techniques like Queen-fusion to handle scale variations more effectively. The controlled experiments also provide some interesting insights about the relative importance of different components for object detection.
