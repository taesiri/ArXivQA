# [OlympiadBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Promoting AGI with   Olympiad-Level Bilingual Multimodal Scientific Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing math and physics benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) lack sufficient difficulty and multimodality. Models are approaching saturated performance on current benchmarks.
- More challenging benchmarks are needed to push progress in scientific reasoning capabilities for future AI systems.

Proposed Solution - OlympiadBench Dataset:  
- Features 8,952 Olympiad-level math and physics problems sourced from international and Chinese competitions.
- Problems are open-ended free response format, with detailed expert solutions provided. 
- Over half the problems incorporate visual diagrams and images.
- Benchmark is bilingual, with problems in both English and Chinese.
- Implemented an automated scoring pipeline to evaluate model performance.

Key Contributions:
- Created the most challenging benchmark to date for scientific reasoning, surpassing all existing sets in difficulty level.
- Comprehensive coverage spanning multiple fields and problem types in both physics and mathematics. 
- First bilingual dataset with multimodal reasoning for math and physics.
- Analysis of state-of-the-art models exposes limitations - top model GPT-4V only scores 17.23% overall accuracy. Particularly struggles on physics (11.28%) and non-English problems.
- Identified key issues with existing models: hallucinations, knowledge gaps, logical errors.
- Valuable benchmark to drive progress in developing expert-level scientific reasoning for AI.

The paper introduces OlympiadBench as a pioneering effort to assess and advance multimodal, bilingual scientific reasoning to expert levels for large language models. Detailed analysis exposes current limitations, providing challenges for future work.
