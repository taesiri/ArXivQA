# [OneBit: Towards Extremely Low-bit Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for quantizing large language models (LLMs) to extremely low bitwidths like 1-bit suffer from severe performance degradation. Methods like post-training quantization and existing quantization-aware training frameworks struggle when compressing models down to 1-bit, failing to maintain effectiveness. This is mainly due to the drastic precision loss causing substantial inaccuracies in the core linear projection operations within LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel 1-bit model architecture for LLMs to improve time and space efficiency during inference. The key ideas include:

1) A new linear layer design using a 1-bit sign matrix for weights along with two small FP16 value vectors to compensate for precision loss. This representation better quantizes weights while adding little overhead.

2) A sign-value independent decomposition (SVID) method to initialize the 1-bit model by decomposing the original FP32/FP16 weights into the proposed format. SVID provides an effective starting point for further training.

3) Quantization-aware knowledge distillation to transfer capabilities from the original full-precision teacher model to the proposed 1-bit student model. Custom loss functions based on output logits and internal representations are used.

Main Contributions:

- A highly efficient 1-bit model architecture specially designed for quantizing LLMs that is more amenable to training and knowledge transfer compared to prior works.

- The SVID technique for weight matrix decomposition that produces superior initialization for the 1-bit student model, improving performance and convergence speed. 

- Extensive experiments on major LLM families (OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2) from 1.3B to 13B parameters showcasing stable training and state-of-the-art results compared to strong baselines. The method achieves at least 83% of full-precision performance with over 90% compression.

- Analysis providing guidance for future research into extremely low-bit LLMs in terms of efficiency, robustness and problem-solving abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 1-bit model architecture and training method called OneBit to enable extreme quantization of large language models down to 1-bit weights while preserving at least 83\% of the full-precision performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel and efficient 1-bit model architecture for large language models (LLMs), which can improve both the time and space efficiency during model inference. The architecture is also more stable for quantizing LLMs.

2. It proposes Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (SVID) to decompose high-bit weight matrices into low-bit ones, which is essential for initializing the 1-bit model architecture. Experiments show this initialization can improve model performance and convergence speed. 

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method works well across different model sizes from 1.3B to 13B parameters on various LLMs. This showcases the generalizability of the method.

In summary, the key innovation is the 1-bit model architecture and initialization method that enables extremely low-bit quantization of large language models while maintaining good performance. The experiments verify the effectiveness across different models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Extremely low-bit quantization: The paper focuses on quantizing large language models (LLMs) to extremely low bit-widths like 1-bit for weights. This allows significant reduction in model size.

- Quantization-aware training (QAT): The method proposed integrates quantization steps into the training process to help the model adapt better. This leads to better performance than direct post-training quantization.  

- Sign-value independent decomposition (SVID): A novel matrix decomposition method proposed to initialize the quantized model weights. It decomposes the weight matrix into a sign matrix and value vectors.

- Knowledge transfer: The paper uses knowledge distillation to transfer capabilities from the original full-precision LLM to the quantized student model. Cross-entropy loss and MSE loss on hidden states are used.

- Model efficiency: The very low-bit quantization achieved allows much lower memory footprint and faster inference, enabling deployment on more hardware. There is a tradeoff with some performance loss.

- Model robustness: The proposed architecture and training method is shown to be more robust than prior 1-bit approaches.

In summary, the key focus is achieving 1-bit weight quantization for LLMs using a specialized architecture and training methodology to maximize efficiency while preserving model capabilities as much as possible.
