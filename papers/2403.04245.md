# [A Study of Dropout-Induced Modality Bias on Robustness to Missing Video   Frames for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04245)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Advanced audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems are highly sensitive to missing video frames, performing even worse than single-modality models. Applying dropout on video frames during training enhances robustness to missing frames but causes performance degradation on complete inputs. This paper investigates this contradictory phenomenon from the perspective of modality bias.

Key Insights:
- Dropout induces excessive modality bias towards the audio, causing a shift from a multimodal joint distribution to a unimodal distribution focused just on audio. This leads to over-reliance on audio and neglect of visual cues.
- The Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH) is proposed to systematically relate modality bias to robustness against missing modalities. Higher bias aligns with higher robustness when that biased modality is present but lower performance when it is missing.

Proposed Solution: 
- Multimodal Distribution Approximation with Knowledge Distillation (MDA-KD): Uses latent knowledge from a teacher model trained on complete data to prevent excessive bias during student robustness training. Maintains performance without missing frames while enhancing robustness.  
- Modality-Specific Adapters: Dynamically switch decision strategy to rely solely on audio when video is completely missing. Achieves superior audio-only performance.

Key Results:
- Uncovers the shift from multimodal to unimodal latent distributions underlying dropout-induced bias 
- Outperforms state of the art on MISP2021 and MISP2022 benchmarks, enhancing robustness without degrading complete input performance
- Surpasses audio-only model performance when video fully missing by using adapters  

In summary, this paper provides key insights into contradictory AVSR performance phenomena using the lens of modality bias. The proposed methods achieve both accuracy and robustness across varying degrees of video absence.
