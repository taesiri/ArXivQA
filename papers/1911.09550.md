# [All You Need Is Boundary: Toward Arbitrary-Shaped Text Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09550)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop an end-to-end trainable network for spotting arbitrary-shaped text in images without needing character-level annotations?The key points are:- The paper proposes representing text regions using a set of boundary points rather than rectangular boxes or segmentation masks. - This representation with boundary points is more flexible for describing text of different shapes and can effectively bridge text detection and recognition in an end-to-end framework.- The method aims to spot arbitrary shaped text in an end-to-end manner without needing extra character-level supervision. - Experiments on curved text datasets like TotalText and oriented text datasets like ICDAR 2015 demonstrate state-of-the-art performances, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.So in summary, the main research question is how to develop an end-to-end text spotting model that can handle arbitrary shaped text without character-level supervision, which is addressed through the proposed boundary point representation.
