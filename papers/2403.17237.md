## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DreamPolisher: Towards High-Quality Text-to-3D Generation via Geometric Diffusion":

Problem:
Recent text-to-3D generation methods can produce 3D objects from textual descriptions. However, prevailing approaches often fail to ensure view-consistency and textural richness, especially for methods working with text input alone. This causes issues like the "Janus" (multi-face) problem.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes DreamPolisher, a novel two-stage Gaussian Splatting based approach to generate high-quality and view-consistent 3D assets from text. 

In the first coarse optimization stage, 3D Gaussians are initialized using a text-to-point cloud diffusion model and further optimized with geometric guidance from a text-to-image diffusion model. This ensures consistent 3D geometry to mitigate issues like the Janus problem.

The second refinement stage uses a ControlNet-driven appearance refiner and a geometric consistency loss. The ControlNet refiner enhances fine-grained texture details and visual quality. The consistency loss improves coherence across different views of the 3D object.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of DreamPolisher, a Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation method incorporating geometric diffusion guidance to achieve high visual quality and cross-view consistency.

- Introduction of a ControlNet-based appearance refiner tailored to enhancing intricate textural details of generated 3D assets.

- Formulation of a geometric consistency loss function that enforces appearance similarity among different views for improving coherence.

Experiments across diverse object categories demonstrate DreamPolisherâ€™s ability to produce consistent and realistic 3D objects closely matching the semantics of textual prompts. Comparisons show superior performance over state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation techniques.
