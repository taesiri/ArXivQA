# [Re-DiffiNet: Modeling discrepancies loss in tumor segmentation using   diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07354)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Accurately segmenting brain tumors and identifying tumor margins remains challenging for clinical adoption of deep learning methods. 
- While U-Net based models have achieved high dice scores, improving boundary distance metrics like Hausdorff distance (HD) is important for surgical planning.
- Modeling variability in tumor shapes and capturing finer details at boundaries is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Re-DiffiNet - a framework to model discrepancy between U-Net predictions and ground truth using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs).
- DDPMs can generate high quality images and capture data variability.
- Re-DiffiNet takes MRI scan and U-Net predictions as input. It models the incorrect voxels in U-Net predictions and flip those voxels to output improved tumor masks.

Key Contributions:
- Modeling discrepancy explicitly using DDPMs to refine U-Net predictions.
- Leveraging advantages of DDPMs to focus on incorrect regions and capture tumor shape variability.
- 16.28% improvement in HD95 score over U-Net indicating better boundary distance metrics.
- Average 0.55% improvement in Dice score over 5-fold cross validation.
- Qualitative improvements showing smoother tumor boundaries.

In summary, Re-DiffiNet refines U-Net predictions by explicitly modeling discrepancies through diffusion models. This leads to quantitative and qualitative improvements in brain tumor segmentation.
