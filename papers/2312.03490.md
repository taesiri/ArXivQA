# [PneumoLLM: Harnessing the Power of Large Language Model for   Pneumoconiosis Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03490)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces PneumoLLM, an innovative framework that harnesses the knowledge and capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to diagnose the occupational lung disease pneumoconiosis using chest X-ray images. A key innovation is simplifying the typical vision-language pipeline by eliminating the separate text branch and instead using a classification head to elicit diagnoses directly from the LLM. To balance retaining image details while steering towards accurate diagnosis, the authors design a contextual multi-token engine to generate diagnostic tokens conditioned on the original image tokens, along with an information emitter module enabling unidirectional knowledge flow. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world pneumoconiosis dataset demonstrate PneumoLLM's superiority over existing natural image classifiers and medical diagnosis methods, while ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed components. The simplified pipeline and lightweight adapter-based fine-tuning strategy also facilitate knowledge extraction from the LLM despite limited training data. By effectively harnessing LLMs for streamlined diagnosis tailored to diseases with scarce annotated data, PneumoLLM charts an inventive direction in applying foundation models to practical clinical needs.
