# [Selective Weak Supervision for Neural Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10382)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the central research question seems to be how to effectively train neural information retrieval (Neu-IR) models in scenarios where large-scale relevance training data is not available. 

The key ideas proposed to address this are:

1) Leveraging anchor text-document pairs as a source of "weak supervision" to train Neu-IR models, based on the intuition that anchor texts are similar to queries. 

2) Using a reinforcement learning approach called "ReInfoSelect" to selectively pick good anchor-document pairs to train the Neu-IR model, rather than using all anchor pairs which can be noisy.

3) Iteratively training the data selection module ("ReInfoSelect") and the Neu-IR model using policy gradients, with the goal of maximizing the Neu-IR model's accuracy on a validation set of true query-document relevance labels.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that anchor text can be used as a weak supervision signal to train Neu-IR models effectively, if noisy anchor pairs are filtered out selectively using a reinforcement learning approach tailored to maximize relevance matching accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new method called ReInfoSelect for training neural information retrieval models using weak supervision from anchor text data. The key ideas are:

- Revisiting the classic IR intuition that anchor text-document pairs can approximate query-document relevance for training. 

- Using a reinforcement learning approach called ReInfoSelect to selectively pick good anchor text-document pairs to train the neural ranker, where the reward signal is the ranking performance on a small set of query-document relevance labels.

- Iteratively training the data selection policy network and the neural ranker model using policy gradients until the neural ranker's performance converges.

- Showing that neural rankers trained with ReInfoSelect and only publicly available anchor data can match or exceed the effectiveness of models trained on private commercial search log data across several TREC benchmarks.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing a novel reinforcement learning based method for selectively using noisy anchor text data to train high quality neural ranking models without needing a large commercial search log. This helps "democratize" neural IR by reducing its dependence on large-scale private labeled data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- Most prior work on neural information retrieval (Neu-IR) has relied on large amounts of labeled training data, like search logs or expert relevance judgments. This paper proposes a method to train Neu-IR models with only weak supervision from anchor texts and linked web documents, which are more readily available.

- Previous methods using anchor texts for IR tasks like query expansion treated them as additional text features. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, ReInfoSelect, to selectively choose high-quality anchor-document pairs to directly supervise Neu-IR models.

- The proposed approach outperforms prior weakly supervised Neu-IR methods and achieves effectiveness rivaling models trained on private commercial search logs, using only publicly available data. This could expand the applicability of Neu-IR to academic and non-web search settings lacking large labeled datasets.

- Analysis shows ReInfoSelect adapts its selection strategy based on the training state of the target ranker, being more lenient with noisy data initially and more selective as training progresses. This demonstrates learning when and how to effectively use weak supervision.

- Results are demonstrated on two state-of-the-art Neu-IR models, Conv-KNRM and BERT Ranker. The ability to train both shallow and deep neural architectures with weak supervision expands the potential usage.

- The paper provides novel analysis into data efficiency, fine-tuning strategies, and behaviors of Neu-IR models by alleviating the training data bottleneck. This could inform future research directions.

Overall, this paper makes important contributions in training Neu-IR without large labeled datasets by intelligently selecting public data. The proposed ideas could help transition Neu-IR techniques to broader applications lacking massive labeled data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more sophisticated selection methods for choosing anchor-document pairs as weak supervision signals. The authors note that their proposed Reinforcement Information retrieval weak supervision Selector (ReInfoSelect) method is relatively simple, selecting pairs based on a linear layer applied to state representations. They suggest exploring more complex and adaptive selection methods.

- Applying ReInfoSelect or similar weak supervision selection techniques to other neural ranking models besides Conv-KNRM and BERT. The authors experiment with these two architectures but suggest the approach could work for other neural ranking models as well.

- Exploring different combinations of feature-based learning to rank methods with neural ranking models. The authors show benefits of combining methods like SDM scores with neural features, and suggest further exploration of hybrid feature-based and neural systems.

- Analyzing the impact of different training data strategies, like the number and balance of queries vs documents. The authors provide some initial results but suggest more work could be done to understand how to optimize weak supervision data.

- Further analysis of the dynamics and behaviors of iterative training processes like ReInfoSelect. The authors provide some training curve analyses but suggest this is still an area needing more investigation.

- Applying similar weak supervision techniques to other information retrieval tasks beyond document ranking, to alleviate dependence on large labeled datasets.

In general, the authors propose selective weak supervision as a promising approach to train neural rankers without large relevance training sets, and suggest numerous avenues for extending this idea further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called ReInfoSelect for weak supervision of neural information retrieval models. The key idea is to leverage anchor text and linked web pages as a source of weak supervision, since anchor text tends to be similar to search queries. However, not all anchor text provides useful signal, so the method uses reinforcement learning to selectively pick good anchor text-document pairs to train the neural ranker. Specifically, it learns a policy to decide which anchor pairs to select based on the improvement in the neural ranker's validation NDCG on a target ranking task. The neural ranker and selection policy are trained jointly by iterating between taking policy gradient steps to update the selection policy and backpropagation steps to update the ranker on selected pairs. Experiments on three TREC benchmarks show the method outperforms both feature-based rankers and neural rankers trained with other forms of weak supervision. It is the first completely public weakly supervised method to match performance of models trained on commercial search log data. Analysis shows the selection policy becomes more selective as training progresses, first taking most anchor pairs then focusing on ones more similar to queries.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called ReInfoSelect for training neural ranking models using weak supervision from anchor text. The key idea is to use reinforcement learning to select high quality anchor text-document pairs that serve as training data to optimize the neural ranker. Specifically, the method learns a policy network that decides whether to select each anchor text-document pair as training data based on their estimated utility for improving the neural ranker. The policy network is trained via policy gradients to maximize the actual performance of the neural ranker on a validation set. This allows ReInfoSelect to customize the training data selection based on the current state of the neural ranker. 

Experiments on multiple TREC collections show that neural rankers trained with the anchor text pairs selected by ReInfoSelect substantially outperform the same models trained on all anchor data or trained with no weak supervision. The performance matches or exceeds models trained on private commercial search log data. Analysis shows the selection policy becomes more selective as training progresses, initially using most anchor pairs then focusing on ones most similar to real queries. Overall, ReInfoSelect provides an effective way to train high quality neural ranking models using just publicly available anchor text, without requiring large amounts of human labels.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes ReInfoSelect, a reinforcement learning method for selecting anchor-document pairs to weakly supervise neural ranking models. The key ideas are:

- Anchor texts are similar to queries and anchor-document relations approximate query-document relevance. So anchors can be used to provide weak supervision signals to train neural rankers. 

- But anchor data is noisy, so a selection method is needed to pick good anchor-document pairs. 

- ReInfoSelect uses a state network to represent anchor-document pairs and an action network to decide whether to select each pair. 

- It connects the data selector to a target neural ranker using policy gradients and REINFORCE. The neural ranker's performance change after training on selected pairs provides the reward signal.

- ReInfoSelect iterates through batches of anchor-document pairs. In each batch, it selects pairs using the state/action networks, trains the neural ranker on those pairs, and evaluates the ranker to get reward. The reward trains the selection networks via policy gradient.

- This iterative process continues until the neural ranker's performance converges. ReInfoSelect learns to select better supervision signals customized for the neural ranker.

In summary, ReInfoSelect uses reinforcement learning to connect weak supervision data selection with training the target neural ranking model. It provides a way to leverage anchor data to train neural rankers without requiring large-scale relevance labels.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper aims to enable neural information retrieval (Neu-IR) in scenarios where large-scale relevance training signals are not available, which is a challenge for Neu-IR methods. 

- It proposes a new method called "Reinforcement Information retrieval weak supervision Selector" (ReInfoSelect) that learns to select good anchor-document pairs to weakly supervise Neu-IR models, using only a small amount of relevance labels.

- ReInfoSelect uses a policy network to select anchor-document pairs and a neural ranker (e.g. Conv-KNRM or BERT) that is trained on the selected pairs. It connects the two with policy gradients and iterates to improve both.

- Experiments on three TREC datasets show ReInfoSelect significantly outperforms other weak supervision methods and matches training with private commercial search logs, using only publicly available data.

- Analyses show ReInfoSelect selects different data based on ranker architecture and training stage, starting lenient then becoming more selective as the ranker converges. Selected pairs are rated as better approximations of relevance.

In summary, the key problem is training Neu-IR without large relevance training data. The proposal is a reinforcement method to selectively and iteratively pick good anchor-document weak training signals customized for the neural ranker. This enables Neu-IR in new scenarios by overcoming its dependency on relevance training data.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper proposes a new method called ReInfoSelect for weakly supervising neural ranking models when large-scale relevance labels are not available. The key idea is to leverage anchor text and linked web pages as a source of weak supervision. However, anchor text can be noisy, so the method uses reinforcement learning to learn to select good anchor-document pairs that provide useful training signal for the neural ranker. 

Specifically, ReInfoSelect has a state network that represents the anchor text, document, and their relation; an action network that decides whether to select the pair; and a reward based on the neural ranker's accuracy after training on the selected pairs. It uses policy gradients to connect the data selection to the final neural ranking performance. The method iterates between selecting supervision data, training the ranker, and updating the selection policy based on the ranking reward. 

Experiments on TREC benchmarks show ReInfoSelect significantly outperforms other weak supervision methods and achieves comparable results to using private commercial search logs, using only publicly available data. Analysis shows it selects better quality anchors over training, is robust across rankers and datasets, and provides insights into effective neural ranker training. The method helps overcome the lack of labeled data for training neural rankers.
