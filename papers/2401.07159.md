# [Quantized Side Tuning: Fast and Memory-Efficient Tuning of Quantized   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Quantized Side Tuning: Fast and Memory-Efficient Tuning of Quantized Large Language Models":

Problem:
- Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is very effective for adapting them to downstream tasks but requires substantial memory during training. 
- Existing parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods update only a subset of parameters to reduce memory but still require caching large intermediate activations.
- Other methods like network quantization and distillation can compress models but hurt performance.
- No existing method effectively reduces memory footprint of model weights, optimizer states, and activations.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Quantized Side Tuning (QST) framework with two stages:
   1) Quantize LLM to 4-bit to reduce weight memory
   2) Introduce lightweight side network that avoids backprop through LLM to reduce activation memory
- Side network downsamples activations from each LLM layer then makes predictions.
- Use factorized projections and pooling for downsampling to minimize extra parameters.
- Combine LLM and side network predictions to retain performance.

Main Contributions:
- Reduces all three major memory contributors during LLM finetuning
- Quantizes weights to 4-bit and avoids caching intermediate LLM activations
- Additional memory savings from very low side network parameters 
- Up to 2.3x total memory reduction and 3x speedup demonstrated
- Matches performance of state-of-the-art finetuning techniques
- Enables large batch training not feasible for other methods
- Easily adaptable model that does not require LLM redeployment

In summary, QST enables much more efficient LLM finetuning by minimizing weight, activation, and parameter memory through quantization and a compact side network while retaining accuracy. It is a novel dual-stage approach that outperforms existing methods on memory reduction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Quantized Side Tuning (QST), a fast and memory-efficient framework for finetuning large language models that operates in two stages: quantizing the model weights to 4-bits to reduce memory footprint and introducing a lightweight side network that avoids backpropagation through the large model to further reduce memory requirements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Quantized Side Tuning (QST), a novel framework for fast and memory-efficient finetuning of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- QST reduces the memory footprint of LLM weights by quantizing the model to 4-bit precision. 

- QST introduces a lightweight side network that avoids backpropagating through the large LLM, thus reducing the memory footprint of activations. The side network utilizes the LLM's hidden states and is adapted to the downstream task.

- QST employs several techniques like low-rank adaptations and pooling to minimize the number of trainable parameters in the side network, reducing memory for optimizer states. 

- Experiments show QST reduces memory footprint by up to 2.3x and speeds up finetuning by 3x compared to methods like QLoRA, with minor performance impact. For example, finetuning a 70B parameter LLM requires only 56GB memory with QST.

In summary, through model quantization and a specifically designed side network, QST enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of even very large language models, allowing their deployment under memory constraints.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Quantized Side Tuning (QST): The proposed fast and memory-efficient finetuning framework for large language models. It involves quantizing the model to 4-bit and using a separate side network.

- Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT): Methods that update only a subset of an LLM's parameters or introduce a small number of new parameters to finetune, while keeping most parameters frozen.

- Memory-efficient training/finetuning: Methods aimed at reducing memory footprint during LLM training or finetuning. 

- 4-bit quantization: Converting the model parameters from 32-bit or 16-bit floats to 4-bit values to reduce memory usage.

- Side network: A small auxiliary network introduced in QST to avoid backpropagating through the entire quantized LLM to save memory for activations.

- Downsampling: Reducing the hidden dimension of the LLM activations before inputting to the side network, using techniques like pooling.

- Optimizer state: Additional memory needed to store optimizer-related variables like gradients and momentum values during training.

- Intermediate activations: Memory needed to store outputs of each layer during forward and backward passes.

So in summary - quantization, side networks, downsampling, parameter efficient tuning, memory footprint reduction during training are some of the key things this paper focuses on.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Quantized Side Tuning (QST) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that QST operates through a dual-stage process. Can you elaborate on the need for this dual-stage approach? What are the limitations of adopting only one of the two stages?

2. One of the key ideas in QST is to separate the side network from the quantized language model. What is the intuition behind avoiding backpropagation through the entire network? How does this help reduce memory consumption?

3. The paper explores different downsampling methods like LoRA, Adapter, and pooling layers. Can you analyze the tradeoffs between these methods in terms of performance, memory footprint and trainable parameters? 

4. The finetuning process in QST only updates the parameters of the side network. Does this lead to underfitting on complex downstream tasks? How can the framework be extended to allow limited updates to the language model as well?

5. The paper demonstrates QST for supervised learning tasks like GLUE. How can the method be adapted for unsupervised pretraining objectives like masked language modeling? What changes would be required?

6. One disadvantage of quantization is reduced model accuracy. Does QST effectively address this issue? Can you suggest any techniques to further boost performance of the 4-bit quantized model?

7. QST shows significant improvements for large models like OPT-66B and LLaMA-70B. Would similar gains be observed for smaller models? What is the minimum model size for which QST is beneficial?

8. The chatbot results highlight that QST even outperforms the original LLaMA-70B. What modifications enable this? Is there a risk of overfitting on certain datasets?

9. How easy is it to adapt QST across different model architectures like Transformers, CNNs, etc.? What components need to be changed to ensure smooth integration?

10. The paper focuses on language tasks. Do you foresee challenges in deploying QST for vision models? Would techniques like distillation be more suitable for such models?
