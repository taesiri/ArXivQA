# [NLEBench+NorGLM: A Comprehensive Empirical Analysis and Benchmark   Dataset for Generative Language Models in Norwegian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01314)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating generative language models (GLMs) focus primarily on high-resource languages like English. Low-resource languages are underrepresented.
- Many existing low-resource benchmarks also focus on evaluating discriminative models like BERT rather than generative models. 
- Current benchmarks lack comprehensive task coverage to evaluate generalization capabilities of GLMs across diverse tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces NLEBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating GLMs in Norwegian, a low-resource language.
- NLEBench covers a diverse set of real-world NLP tasks including news storytelling, summarization, open-domain conversation, NLU, instruction tuning, toxicity evaluation etc.
- The paper also introduces foundational Norwegian GLMs (NorGLMs) trained from scratch with varying model sizes.
- NorGLMs are evaluated on NLEBench tasks to gain insights into their capabilities and scalability across different tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Release of NLEBench - the first comprehensive GLM evaluation benchmark tailored for Norwegian
- Introduction of two novel datasets - instructions based on Norwegian culture/expressions and a document-grounded multi-label dataset
- Development of foundational NorGLMs and evaluation of their capabilities using NLEBench
- Insights into model performance, generalization ability and unique linguistic properties of Norwegian vs. mainstream languages

The paper demonstrates the need for specialized benchmarks for low-resource languages using Norwegian as a case study. The introduced benchmark and models lay the groundwork for advancing Norwegian NLP.
