# [NLEBench+NorGLM: A Comprehensive Empirical Analysis and Benchmark   Dataset for Generative Language Models in Norwegian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01314)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating generative language models (GLMs) focus primarily on high-resource languages like English. Low-resource languages are underrepresented.
- Many existing low-resource benchmarks also focus on evaluating discriminative models like BERT rather than generative models. 
- Current benchmarks lack comprehensive task coverage to evaluate generalization capabilities of GLMs across diverse tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces NLEBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating GLMs in Norwegian, a low-resource language.
- NLEBench covers a diverse set of real-world NLP tasks including news storytelling, summarization, open-domain conversation, NLU, instruction tuning, toxicity evaluation etc.
- The paper also introduces foundational Norwegian GLMs (NorGLMs) trained from scratch with varying model sizes.
- NorGLMs are evaluated on NLEBench tasks to gain insights into their capabilities and scalability across different tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Release of NLEBench - the first comprehensive GLM evaluation benchmark tailored for Norwegian
- Introduction of two novel datasets - instructions based on Norwegian culture/expressions and a document-grounded multi-label dataset
- Development of foundational NorGLMs and evaluation of their capabilities using NLEBench
- Insights into model performance, generalization ability and unique linguistic properties of Norwegian vs. mainstream languages

The paper demonstrates the need for specialized benchmarks for low-resource languages using Norwegian as a case study. The introduced benchmark and models lay the groundwork for advancing Norwegian NLP.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces NLEBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and suite of Norwegian generative language models to evaluate capabilities and provide insights into scaling laws when applying transformers to an underrepresented language like Norwegian.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It releases a new benchmark dataset, NLEBench, for evaluating generative language models on Norwegian, which is a low-resource language. This benchmark contains datasets for various tasks like news summarization, open-domain conversation, instruction following, etc.

2. It contributes two new datasets - an instruction dataset with human written instructions about Norwegian culture and expressions, and a multi-task dataset with human annotations for news classification, question-answering, and summarization.

3. It develops and releases a suite of Norwegian causal language models (NorGLMs) pre-trained from scratch with different model sizes and architectures like GPT-2 and LLAMA. It provides an in-depth evaluation and analysis of the capabilities and scalability of these NorGLMs on the proposed benchmark tasks.

4. Through the benchmark evaluation, it provides insights about model performance on low-resource languages compared to mainstream languages, the effect of training data quality and size on model capabilities, and correlation between chain-of-thought reasoning and original task performance.

In summary, the main contribution is the release of a comprehensive benchmark tailored to Norwegian language, along with foundational language models and an extensive set of experiments and insights on model evaluation for low-resource languages.

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called NLEBench tailored for evaluating generative language models on the Norwegian language, which is considered a low-resource language. It includes tasks like news summarization, open-domain conversation, instruction tuning, toxicity/bias evaluation, and multi-task learning. The paper also introduces some foundational Norwegian GLMs and evaluates them systematically on the proposed benchmark to provide insights into their capabilities. Concepts like Chain-of-Thought and model efficiency are also explored.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new benchmark dataset called NLEBench for evaluating Norwegian language models. What are some of the key motivations and goals behind developing this new benchmark? How is it different from existing benchmarks?

2. One component of NLEBench is a new instruction dataset covering Norwegian culture, idioms, slang etc. Why was this an important addition compared to just using a translated dataset? What unique capabilities can it help evaluate?  

3. The paper trains several Norwegian causal language models from scratch. What model architectures were explored? What were some of the key training specifications like dataset size, hyperparameters etc.? 

4. For the multi-task dataset, the paper explores using chain-of-thought prompting to improve summarization and question answering. Can you explain this method? What were the key results and insights from this experiment?

5. The paper evaluates model toxicity using the Perspective API. What were some interesting findings related to model toxicity? Where might some of this toxicity originate from despite efforts to filter the training data?

6. One finding is that the 23B parameter model did not show clear advantages over smaller models on some tasks. What might be some reasons or hypotheses proposed to explain this result?

7. The Llama architecture seemed to perform differently across tasks compared to the GPT models. What specifically was this model better or worse at? What might explain this architectural difference?

8. Pre-training larger models requires more computational resources. What metrics were used to measure and compare the efficiency of pre-training different sized models? How did efficiency scale with model size?

9. The paper emphasizes evaluating model consistency in addition to aggregate metrics. What analysis was done to assess consistency and meaningfulness across samples? What issues were identified?

10. The results show promise but also limitations of current models on Norwegian language tasks. What are 1-2 concrete next steps proposed to further advance Norwegian language modeling?
