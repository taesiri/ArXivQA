# [GOLD: Generalized Knowledge Distillation via Out-of-Distribution-Guided   Language Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs) to small language models (SLMs) is important for efficient deployment, but faces challenges. 
- Prior works use LLMs to generate data for distilling SLMs, but this tends to sample from the center of the original data distribution, missing the tails.
- This causes the distilled SLM to not learn the true distribution and forget low probability events, hurting generalizability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GOLD, an iterative framework for LLM data generation and SLM distillation. 
- It uses an out-of-distribution (OOD) guided feedback mechanism to find failure modes of the SLM and provide feedback to the LLM to generate more diverse data covering the tails of the distribution.
- An energy-based OOD evaluation approach is introduced to select high quality OOD samples from the noisy LLM generated data to provide feedback.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a task-agnostic LLM distillation framework applicable to any NLP task, even novel tasks.
- Introduces an iterative OOD-based feedback loop between LLM data generation and SLM evaluation to improve SLM generalizability.  
- Proposes using energy scores for OOD sample selection, robust to noisy labels.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks, outperforming prior arts.
- Shows the framework's effectiveness on less explored tasks like optimization problem text generation.
