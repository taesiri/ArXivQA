# Deep Fusion Network for Image Completion

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we achieve smoother/more harmonious transitions when completing missing regions in images using deep learning methods? The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposing a "fusion block" module that predicts an alpha composition map to smoothly combine generated image content with existing content, avoiding sharp transitions. This also provides an attention mechanism.- Embedding fusion blocks at multiple scales in a U-Net architecture to apply multi-scale constraints. This allows propagating structure and texture information from known to unknown regions. - Selectively applying structural and textural losses at different scales, using lower layers for structure and higher layers for texture.- Introducing a new "Boundary Pixels Error" metric to quantitatively measure transition quality near hole boundaries.- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on image completion benchmarks, with smoother transitions, better texture detail, and structural consistency compared to previous methods.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by using the proposed fusion blocks and multi-scale architecture, they can achieve better harmony and smoothness in image completion, which is demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative experiments. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the summary!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper seem to be:- Proposing a Deep Fusion Network (DFNet) for image completion that uses fusion blocks to blend the restored image region with the existing image content. This allows for smoother transitions between restored and existing regions. - The fusion blocks generate an alpha composition map to combine the restored and existing content. This avoids learning an identity mapping for known pixels and provides an attention mechanism focusing on unknown regions.- Embedding fusion blocks at multiple decoder layers in a U-Net architecture to enable multi-scale constraints. This helps recover structural information in lower layers and refine texture details in higher layers. - Selectively applying structure and texture loss constraints to different resolution outputs from the fusion blocks to optimize performance.- Introducing a new Boundary Pixels Error (BPE) metric to evaluate transition smoothness near the boundary of missing regions. - Achieving state-of-the-art performance on image completion benchmarks, with improved texture transition, detail, and structural consistency compared to previous methods.In summary, the key innovations seem to be the proposed fusion blocks for blending, the multi-scale architecture with selective loss constraints, and the new evaluation metric for boundary transition quality. The combination of these contributions allows their Deep Fusion Network to achieve improved image completion results.
