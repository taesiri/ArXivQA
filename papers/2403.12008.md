# [SV3D: Novel Multi-view Synthesis and 3D Generation from a Single Image   using Latent Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Single image 3D object reconstruction is challenging as it requires lifting 2D pixels to 3D while also reasoning about unseen portions of the object. 
- Recent works use image-based generative models for novel view synthesis (NVS) to provide supervision for 3D optimization. However, they suffer from limited views or inconsistent NVS, affecting 3D generation quality.

Method:
- The paper proposes SV3D, which adapts an image-to-video diffusion model called Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) for NVS and 3D generation. 
- SV3D inherits useful properties from SVD: pose-controllable, multi-view consistent, and generalizable. It is the first to adapt a video diffusion model for explicit camera pose-controlled view synthesis.
- For NVS, elevation and azimuth angles of camera poses are embedded and fed into SVD's convolutional blocks. The conditional image's CLIP embedding is provided to cross-attention layers.
- For 3D generation, a two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization is performed, using Instant-NGP NeRF and DMTet mesh. The SV3D-generated views provide supervision.
- A disentangled illumination model and masked SDS loss are proposed to reduce baked-in lighting and enhance unseen regions.

Contributions:
- First framework to adapt an image-to-video diffusion model for controllable multi-view synthesis and 3D generation.
- State-of-the-art NVS results in terms of quality, consistency, controllability, and generalization. 
- High-fidelity 3D mesh generation by exploiting temporal consistency in video diffusion models.
- Novel techniques like masked SDS loss and disentangled lighting to further improve 3D optimization.

In summary, the paper pushes the state-of-the-art in single image 3D reconstruction by creatively leveraging the strengths of video diffusion models. Both the NVS and 3D results outperform prior arts by a significant margin.
