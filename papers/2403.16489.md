# [Spatially temporally distributed informative path planning for   multi-robot systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the problem of informative path planning for a mobile robotic sensor network to map a spatio-temporal environmental field, such as temperature. The key challenges are:
(1) The robots have limited mobility and can only gather measurements at their current locations.
(2) The environmental field varies over both space and time.
(3) The mapping needs to be done in a distributed manner without overloading communication and computation. 
(4) The connectivity of the robot network needs to be maintained during the exploration.

Proposed Solution:
The key elements of the proposed solution are:

1. Utilize Gaussian Process Regression to model the spatio-temporal field based on the measurements gathered by the robots. The model is updated as new measurements are collected overtime.

2. Formulate an informative path planning optimization problem to find optimal paths for each robot that maximize the information gain of the overall model in both space and time. Novel local cost functions are introduced that incorporate future paths of neighboring robots to account for cross-correlation.  

3. Leverage dual decomposition to decompose the optimization into subproblems that can be solved distributively by each robot with information exchange between neighbors only.  

4. Ensure network connectivity during exploration by adding constraints to keep certain neighbors connected at next time step.

Main Contributions:

1. New informative path planning approach to map spatio-temporal fields using mobile robot networks in a distributed manner.

2. Novel local cost functions that incorporate future paths of neighbors for better coordination while preserving distributed nature.

3. Optimization decomposition technique to distribute the problem to individual robots with low communication overhead.

4. Connectivity preservation constraints integrated into the path planning.

5. Validation using multi-robot simulation with real-world spatio-temporal temperature dataset demonstrating high quality mapping and prediction.
