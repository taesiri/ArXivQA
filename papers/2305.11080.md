# [Inspecting the Geographical Representativeness of Images from   Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11080)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How geographically representative are the images generated by text-to-image models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion? In other words, to what extent do the generated images reflect the artifacts and surroundings of different countries around the world?

The paper examines this question through a crowdsourced user study with participants from 27 countries, where they rate how well model-generated images of common nouns reflect their local surroundings. Some key points:

- The main metric is the "geographical representativeness" score reflecting how well images match a user's surroundings. 

- They study both underspecified prompts without country names (to see default generations) and prompts with country names.

- They compare DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion models on this metric.

- They also explore the feasibility of automatically evaluating geographical representativeness without user studies.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that text-to-image models may underrepresent certain countries or overrepresent others, which they test through geographical representativeness scores from the crowdsourced study.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Conducting a user study with 540 participants from 27 countries to evaluate how geographically representative images generated by DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion are. The study examines images of common nouns like "house", "city", etc. generated with and without specifying a country in the prompt.

- Finding that for prompts without a specified country, the generated images reflect the surroundings of the US and India the most, while poorly reflecting many other countries like Greece and Japan. Specifying the country name improves representativeness. 

- Comparing DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, and finding DALL-E 2 generates more geographically representative images when the country is specified, but no significant difference for unspecified prompts.

- Analyzing the relationship between perceived realism of images and their geographic representativeness based on user ratings. More realistic images tend to be rated as more geographically representative.

- Evaluating the feasibility of automatically assessing geographic representativeness of images using CLIP similarity and nearest neighbors, finding both approaches inadequate.

So in summary, the main contribution is conducting a large-scale user study to quantify and analyze the geographical representativeness of two popular text-to-image models. The study provides insights into current issues and limitations around geographic inclusiveness of these models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper measures how well images generated by DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion text-to-image models reflect the surroundings of different countries through a crowdsourced study with participants from 27 countries.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares and contrasts with other related work in measuring biases in AI systems:

- This paper focuses specifically on evaluating geographical representation in text-to-image models, whereas most prior work has focused on other types of biases like gender, racial, and occupational biases. The emphasis on geographic inclusion is novel.

- The paper conducts a large-scale crowdsourced user study across 27 countries to systematically evaluate geographical biases. Most prior work relies on smaller studies or qualitative analysis. The breadth of the user study is impressive.

- The paper examines both underspecified prompts as well as prompts with country names specified. This helps analyze both the default behavior as well as the impact of providing more geographic context.

- The paper compares two popular text-to-image models - DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. Looking at multiple models provides more robust and generalizable findings.

- The paper empirically demonstrates that automatically evaluating geographic representativeness is challenging, unlike some other biases. This highlights unique challenges in this space.

- The study is limited to only 10 common nouns and 27 countries. Expanding the vocabulary and geographic coverage could reveal additional insights but may be practically difficult.

Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution in systematically evaluating geographic representation in text-to-image models. The large-scale user study across countries and comparison of models are significant strengths. The focus on geographic inclusion and the difficulty of automatic evaluation are interesting findings that advance the literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Conducting similar studies to evaluate the geographical representativeness of more countries, especially underrepresented developing nations. The current study was limited to only 27 countries due to difficulties in getting survey responses. Expanding the coverage would provide a more comprehensive view.

- Evaluating more common nouns/artifacts beyond the 10 studied in this work. Using more concepts would strengthen the findings. 

- Examining techniques to aggregate ratings for images of the same noun-country pair. This could help scale up evaluation by reducing the number of images to be rated per participant.

- Better documenting the sources of training data used by models to understand the distribution of images across countries. This could shed light on underlying data imbalances.

- Collecting and augmenting more diverse geographical training data, especially from underrepresented regions. This could directly help improve model coverage.

- Exploring better ways to automatically quantify geographical representativeness of generated images without need for human studies. The paper examined two approaches but found them inadequate. More work is needed in this direction.

- Addressing the lack of participation from many countries in model development and evaluation. Improving internet access and representation on crowdsourcing platforms could provide more inclusive feedback.

In summary, the authors call for expanding the scale and diversity of the study, collecting more representative data, developing better evaluation methods, and improving participation from marginalized communities. Addressing these limitations could lead to more geographically inclusive models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper examines the geographical representativeness of images generated by two popular text-to-image models, DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. It conducts a crowdsourced study with 540 participants from 27 countries, who evaluated how well model-generated images of common nouns reflect their local surroundings. Without specifying a country in the prompt, images were found to be most representative of the US and least of Greece, Japan and New Zealand. Specifying a country consistently improves representativeness, but scores remain low for many nations. Images from DALL-E 2 were slightly more geographically representative. The study also finds participant ratings of image realism correlated with geographical representativeness. Attempts to automatically evaluate geographical representativeness, using CLIP similarity or k-nearest neighbors, proved inadequate, showing the value of human evaluation. Overall, the paper demonstrates room for improvement in geographical inclusiveness of text-to-image models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper investigates the geographical representativeness of images generated by two popular text-to-image models - DALL·E 2 and Stable Diffusion. The authors conducted a crowdsourced user study involving 540 participants from 27 countries. Participants were presented images of common nouns generated by the two models, and asked to rate how well the images reflected the artifacts in their surroundings. Half the images were generated using country-specific prompts, while the other half used generic prompts without specifying a country. 

The study found that for generic prompts, the models over-represent the US and under-represent most other countries. Specifying country names in prompts improved representativeness, but scores for many countries remained low. DALL·E 2 was better than Stable Diffusion for country-specific prompts. Participants' ratings of image realism correlated with representativeness scores. The feasibility of automating evaluation of geographical representativeness using CLIP similarity scores or nearest neighbors was found to be inadequate. The authors highlight limitations including sparse participant coverage, and suggest ideas like better documenting training data sources and collecting more diverse images to improve model inclusiveness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper conducts a crowdsourced user study to measure the geographical representativeness of images generated by text-to-image models. The study involves 540 participants from 27 countries who are presented with images of 10 common nouns generated by DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion models. Half of the images presented are generated using country-specific prompts that include the participant's country name, while the other half use underspecified, country-agnostic prompts. Participants rate each image on a 5-point scale based on how well it reflects the given noun in their surroundings. The average ratings are used to compute geographical representativeness scores for each country. The study then analyzes these scores to evaluate how geographically representative the images are, whether specifying the country improves representativeness, how realism impacts scores, and compares DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of geographical representativeness in images generated by text-to-image models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. Specifically, it examines whether the images generated by these models reflect the artifacts and surroundings of different countries around the world, or if they over-represent certain countries like the US. 

The key questions the paper tries to answer are:

- Are the images generated by DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion geographically representative across different countries? Do they over-represent richer or more populous nations?

- To what extent does specifying the country name in the input text prompt improve the geographical representativeness? 

- Does the realism or photorealism of the generated images impact people's perception of how geographically representative they are?

- How feasible is it to automatically assess the geographical representativeness of generated images without extensive user studies?

So in summary, the paper is analyzing how geographically inclusive and representative these popular text-to-image models are, and whether techniques like specifying country names or automatic evaluation methods can improve the representation across different parts of the world.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates how geographically representative are the images generated by popular text-to-image models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. Through a crowdsourced user study involving 540 participants across 27 countries, the authors find that for prompts without a specified country, the generated images reflect artifacts predominantly from the United States and India, while inadequately representing surroundings of most other countries (25 out of 27 countries had average scores below 3 out of 5). Specifying the country name in prompts leads to a average increase of 1.44 points for DALL-E 2 and 0.75 points for Stable Diffusion, however, scores remain low for many countries, highlighting room for improvement. Between the two models, DALL-E 2 produces more geographically representative images when prompted with country names, but no significant difference for unspecified prompts. The study also explores automating geographical representativeness evaluation using CLIP similarity and nearest neighbors, but finds both approaches inadequate. Key limitations are the coverage of only 27 countries and 10 common nouns. Overall, the study provides useful insights into how geographically inclusive are images from text-to-image models, and motivation for future work to improve geographical diversity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper measures the geographical representativeness of images generated from text prompts by DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion models through a crowdsourced user study across 27 countries, finding the images to be largely representative of the US and underrepresent most other countries, although specifying country names in prompts helps increase representativeness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how well images generated by DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion text-to-image models reflect the surroundings of different countries through a crowdsourced study with 540 participants across 27 countries. The study finds that for prompts without a country name specified, generated images were not very geographically representative, with average scores below 3 out of 5 for 25 out of the 27 studied countries. The images most reflected artifacts from the US and India. Specifying the country name improved average representativeness scores to 3.49, but many countries still scored low. DALL-E 2 generated more representative images than Stable Diffusion when the country was specified, but both models were similar for unspecified prompts. The study also explored automatically evaluating geographical representativeness using CLIP similarity and nearest neighbors, but found these approaches inadequate, highlighting the need for human evaluation. Overall, the results indicate considerable room for improvement in geographical inclusiveness of text-to-image models.
