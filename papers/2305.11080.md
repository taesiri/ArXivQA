# [Inspecting the Geographical Representativeness of Images from   Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11080)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How geographically representative are the images generated by text-to-image models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion? In other words, to what extent do the generated images reflect the artifacts and surroundings of different countries around the world?

The paper examines this question through a crowdsourced user study with participants from 27 countries, where they rate how well model-generated images of common nouns reflect their local surroundings. Some key points:

- The main metric is the "geographical representativeness" score reflecting how well images match a user's surroundings. 

- They study both underspecified prompts without country names (to see default generations) and prompts with country names.

- They compare DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion models on this metric.

- They also explore the feasibility of automatically evaluating geographical representativeness without user studies.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that text-to-image models may underrepresent certain countries or overrepresent others, which they test through geographical representativeness scores from the crowdsourced study.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Conducting a user study with 540 participants from 27 countries to evaluate how geographically representative images generated by DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion are. The study examines images of common nouns like "house", "city", etc. generated with and without specifying a country in the prompt.

- Finding that for prompts without a specified country, the generated images reflect the surroundings of the US and India the most, while poorly reflecting many other countries like Greece and Japan. Specifying the country name improves representativeness. 

- Comparing DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, and finding DALL-E 2 generates more geographically representative images when the country is specified, but no significant difference for unspecified prompts.

- Analyzing the relationship between perceived realism of images and their geographic representativeness based on user ratings. More realistic images tend to be rated as more geographically representative.

- Evaluating the feasibility of automatically assessing geographic representativeness of images using CLIP similarity and nearest neighbors, finding both approaches inadequate.

So in summary, the main contribution is conducting a large-scale user study to quantify and analyze the geographical representativeness of two popular text-to-image models. The study provides insights into current issues and limitations around geographic inclusiveness of these models.
