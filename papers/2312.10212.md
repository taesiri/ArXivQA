# [A Remark on Concept Drift for Dependent Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of concept drift in dependent data streams, such as time series data. Most existing work assumes data points are independent, but temporal dependencies can influence the sampling process and invalidate common assumptions. The notion of "stationarity" used to characterize absence of change in time series does not align with the notion of "drift" used in machine learning. New formal definitions are needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using the notion of "consistency" rather than stationarity to characterize drift in dependent data streams. A stream is consistent if a predefined set of functions have time-invariant loss on the stream. This better captures the intuitive notion of unexpected distribution change from a machine learning perspective. The paper gives formal definitions and examples.

A method is proposed to test consistency by fitting a global model, testing local fit with kNN, and checking if local fit is no better than chance. This resists overfitting yet detects inconsistent streams. An lMSE loss is presented that converges to MSE for consistent streams.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates theoretically and empirically that stationarity does not align with drift for dependent streams
- Proposes more suitable notion of "consistency" to characterize drift in dependent streams 
- Gives formal definitions and intuitive examples of consistency
- Presents method to test consistency using global & local modeling
- Defines lMSE loss that converges to MSE for consistent streams
- Confirmation on synthetic datasets - consistency detects drift missed by common methods

The paper makes an important conceptual contribution in formalizing drift for dependent data streams. The consistency notion and testing method offer useful tools for concept drift detection in time series and other dependent data.
