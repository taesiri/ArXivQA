# [Graph neural network outputs are almost surely asymptotically constant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the expressive power and convergence properties of graph neural networks (GNNs) when applied to random graph models such as Erdős-Rényi graphs. Specifically, it considers GNN architectures used for probabilistic node or graph classification and analyzes how the predicted class probabilities evolve as the GNNs are applied to progressively larger random graphs. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper defines an aggregate term language that can express a wide variety of GNN architectures involving different aggregation and update functions. This includes MPNNs with mean aggregation, graph attention networks, and graph transformer models. Using this language, the paper shows that for several random graph models, the outputs of probabilistic GNN classifiers expressed in this language will converge almost surely to a constant function. That is, the predicted probabilities become independent of the actual graph structure.

This convergence result is shown:
(1) For various Erdős-Rényi graph distributions, including dense graphs and sparser graphs with different edge probability scalings.
(2) For the stochastic block model.
(3) For any classifier architecture that can be represented using the defined term language involving weighted means and Lipschitz functions. This includes most common MPNN and transformer architectures.

To prove the convergence results, the paper introduces a notion of "almost sure optimization" showing that aggregate terms can be simplified to Lipschitz functions. For sparse graphs, a more intricate analysis using local neighborhood isomorphism types is employed.

Main Contributions:
- Defines a broad aggregate term language that captures many state-of-the-art GNN architectures.
- Shows almost sure convergence of probabilistic GNN classifiers to constant functions for various random graph models, bounding their expressive power.
- Introduces proof techniques involving "almost sure optimization" of aggregate terms over random graphs.
- Empirically validates the convergence phenomena, showing it manifests quickly even for modest graph sizes across different GNN models.

The key insight is that for random graph distributions, as graph size increases, GNNs have limited discrimination ability and converge to predicting constant probabilistic outputs regardless of the actual graph structure. This limitation is quite general across many standard GNN variants.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key finding from the paper:

The paper shows that the output probabilities of graph neural network classifiers applied to randomly generated graphs converge asymptotically to constants as the graphs grow in size, for a broad class of random graph models and neural network architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a new perspective on the expressive power and limitations of graph neural networks (GNNs) when applied to randomly generated graphs. The main contribution is proving that the outputs of a wide variety of GNN architectures, including state-of-the-art models, converge to constant functions as the size of the input graphs increases. Specifically, when these GNNs are used as probabilistic classifiers on random graphs from common generative models (like Erdos-Renyi graphs), their predicted class probabilities converge to fixed values that are independent of the actual graph. 

This shows that the only probabilistic classifiers that can be uniformly expressed by these GNN architectures are asymptotically constant functions. The results are proven rigorously for an expressive term language that can capture many common GNN operators and architectures. The paper also validates these findings empirically, showing that the convergence phenomenon manifests itself even on modestly sized graphs across different models and graph distributions. Overall, this convergence behavior reveals a strong limitation on the uniform expressiveness of GNN probabilistic classifiers.

The paper studies the convergence and expressiveness of graph neural networks and graph transformers when applied to random graphs drawn from distributions like the Erdős-Rényi model and stochastic block model. It introduces a term language to describe these models and shows that their outputs converge to constant functions, providing an upper bound on what they can express uniformly. Key concepts involved include convergence, uniform expressiveness, random graphs, and the development of the term language to capture graph learning architectures.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What mathematical properties of the term language with weighted mean aggregation enabled proving convergence in such a general way across random graph models? Could similar properties be identified for other aggregation functions like max/min to enable proving convergence more broadly?

2. The proof uses an "almost sure optimization" to simplify terms to Lipschitz functions. What are the key insights that enabled this simplification and could it apply more generally to simplify expressions with aggregation? 

3. How was the notion of "graph type" formalized differently in the sparse vs non-sparse cases? What was the intuition behind using local neighborhood isomorphism in the sparse case?

4. What assumptions were made about the growth rates of average node degrees in different random graph models? How did this connect to being able to apply concentration inequalities?

5. The proof relies on a subtle uniformity condition - using the same simplifying functions for most graph inputs. What difficulties arise if non-uniform approximations are used instead? 

6. What bounds can be placed on the rate of convergence empirically observed in experiments based on the proof techniques? How sharp are those bounds likely to be?

7. The weighted mean aggregation can capture complex architectures like graph attention and transformers. What are the key properties enabling this broad expressiveness?

8. How was the stability of neighborhoods in non-sparse graphs leveraged compared to needing to reason about proportions of local isomorphism types in the sparse case?

9. What extensions to other distributions or aggregators like max might be enabled by the introduced proof techniques? What limitations remain to fully generalize?

10. The empirical evaluation showed different convergence behavior between sparse and non-sparse ER graphs that matches the distinct proof techniques. What other empirical insights could validate or expand on the theoretical developments?
