# [A Machine Learning Approach to Detect Customer Satisfaction From   Multiple Tweet Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15992)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Airlines want to analyze customer satisfaction from tweets to improve their services and remain competitive. However, manually analyzing thousands of tweets is tedious. An automated machine learning approach is needed.

- Previous studies have focused only on analyzing the text content of tweets to determine sentiment. They do not utilize other tweet information like time, location, usernames, airline names, etc. which could improve model performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- Develop machine learning models to automatically classify customer satisfaction from tweets as positive, negative or neutral.

- Utilize both tweet text and other tweet parameters like location, time, usernames, airline names as features. 

- Compare performance of SVM, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Also, study effect of additional features beyond tweet text through ablation experiments.

Key Contributions:
- Best performing model was a 1-layer CNN with accuracy over 90%, better than SVM and ANN models.

- Adding features like location and airline names along with tweet text significantly boosted performance across all models, giving over 4% improvement. Demonstrates value of external metadata.

- Provides airline companies an automated classification system leveraging both text and metadata from tweets to gauge customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

In summary, the key novelty is using additional tweet parameters beyond just text sentiment to improve machine learning model performance for classifying customer satisfaction on Twitter airline data. The best CNN model with extra features achieved over 90% accuracy.
