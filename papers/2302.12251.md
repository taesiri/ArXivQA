# [VoxFormer: Sparse Voxel Transformer for Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12251)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes VoxFormer, a Transformer-based framework for 3D semantic scene completion from monocular images. The central hypothesis is that an image-based 3D scene completion system can achieve strong performance by:1) Using a two-stage approach where reconstruction is done before hallucination. The paper hypothesizes that reconstructing the visible scene first provides a more reliable set of features to propagate information to the unobserved regions. 2) Operating on sparse voxel queries rather than dense 3D projections. The paper hypothesizes that using a sparse set of voxel queries linked to image observations is more efficient and avoids ambiguities caused by dense 3D projections.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that an image-based scene completion system can surpass previous approaches by using a two-stage sparse-to-dense framework with explicit depth-based reconstruction and transformer-based feature propagation. The experiments aim to validate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance for monocular 3D scene completion.
