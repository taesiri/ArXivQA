# [Benchmarking Large Language Models on Answering and Explaining   Challenging Medical Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18060)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating medical question answering capabilities of large language models (LLMs) rely on textbook-style questions or general clinical questions, which do not capture the complexity of real clinical cases that doctors face.  
- Moreover, these benchmarks do not contain expert explanations of the answers, which are crucial for doctors to understand the reasoning behind medical decisions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors construct two new challenging medical QA datasets - JAMA Clinical Challenge and Medbullets - which contain questions based on complex real-world clinical cases and USMLE Step 2/3 exam-style questions, respectively.
- Each question is a multiple choice problem with 4/5 answer options, accompanied by an expert-written explanation justifying the correct answer and incorrect choices.

Experiments and Results: 
- Four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2, Llama 2) are evaluated on the two datasets using different prompting strategies. Performance drops compared to previous easier benchmarks, showing the challenge posed by these new datasets.
- Model-generated explanations under prompting are evaluated both automatically and by human annotators. Inconsistency is observed, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics aligned with human judgment.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of two new challenging medical QA datasets with high-quality human explanations
- Demonstration that the new datasets are harder for current LLMs compared to previous benchmarks
- Analysis of model-generated explanations and findings on limitations of current automatic evaluation metrics

The paper makes an important step towards more realistic evaluation of medical reasoning capabilities of LLMs to support doctors in clinical practice. Developing better explanation evaluation metrics is highlighted as an important direction for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces two new challenging medical QA datasets with expert explanations, evaluates four LLMs on them, and finds lower performance compared to previous benchmarks, highlighting the need for future work to enhance model capabilities on complex clinical cases and develop better evaluation metrics for model-generated explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The construction of two new challenging medical question answering datasets - JAMA Clinical Challenge and Medbullets - that consist of real-world clinical cases and recent USMLE Step 2/3 type questions, respectively. Both datasets have high-quality expert explanations paired with each question.

2) The evaluation of four large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2, Llama 2) on these two datasets using different prompting strategies. The experiments demonstrate that the new datasets pose significant challenges for current LLMs.

3) Analysis showing inconsistencies between automatic metrics and human evaluations for assessing the quality of model-generated explanations. This highlights the need to develop better evaluation metrics aligned with human judgments to support future research on explainable medical QA.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of two new challenging medical QA benchmarks with explanations that expose deficiencies in current LLMs, as well as the need for better evaluation metrics for model explanations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 suggested in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper constructs two new challenging medical QA datasets with expert explanations. What are some key differences in the data collection process and contents between these two datasets? What unique value does each dataset provide?

2. When evaluating on the new datasets, the performance of large language models drops compared to previous benchmarks like MedQA. What are some possible reasons for this performance gap? Does it imply deficiencies of current LLMs or limitations of previous benchmarks?

3. The paper explores different prompting strategies like output-only, chain-of-thought and explanation prompts. How do these strategies differ in eliciting reasoning skills versus factual knowledge from LLMs? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses?  

4. Human evaluation results reveal inconsistencies between automatic metrics and human judgments when evaluating model-generated explanations. What factors contribute to this inconsistency? How can we design better automatic metrics that correlate with human assessment?

5. The error analysis surfaces new error types when using chain-of-thought prompting, like models making up new answers. What might cause such errors? Do they indicate reasoning deficiencies of current LLMs? How can prompt design help address these issues?

6. The paper focuses on evaluating text-based LLMs. How might incorporating visual information from clinical images in the datasets impact model performance and evaluation? What new challenges might this introduce?

7. What kinds of additional fine-tuning strategies could help adapt models better to the clinical domains beyond pre-training? Would domain-specific pre-training be necessary or are other approaches possible? 

8. How suitable are current LLMs for supporting actual clinical decision making based on the results? What key capabilities would need enhancement before real-world deployment?  

9. The paper performs mainly offline evaluation. What challenges might arise in interactive settings? How to design simulated interactions for reliable capability assessment?

10. What kinds of bias issues could emerge when deploying LLMs for medical QA? How to proactively assess risks and enhance model safety?
