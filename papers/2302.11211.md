# [Distributionally Robust Recourse Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11211)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is to develop a method for generating robust counterfactual explanations that remain valid even when the underlying model changes due to distribution shift. The paper notes that existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations assume the model is static. However, in practice machine learning models are often retrained due to distribution shifts, causing the model parameters to change. This means counterfactuals generated on the original model may become invalid on the shifted model. To address this, the authors propose a method called Distributionally Robust Counterfactual Explanations (DRCE). The key idea is to generate counterfactuals that are robust against distributional shifts in the model parameters. This is done by modeling the future parameters as a mixture of distributions and finding counterfactuals that minimize the worst-case probability of having the wrong prediction under this mixture model.In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling distributional uncertainty in the model parameters and finding counterfactuals that are robust against this uncertainty will produce explanations that remain valid even when the model changes due to shifts in the data distribution. The DRCE method is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper proposes a framework called Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) to generate robust recourse actions for machine learning models. The key ideas and contributions are:- It adopts a distributionally robust optimization approach to hedge against distributional shifts in the model parameters when designing recourse actions. Specifically, it models the future model parameters as following an ambiguous mixture distribution, and finds recourses that minimize the worst-case probability of unfavorable outcomes under this mixture distribution.- It provides a reformulation of the DiRRAc problem into an equivalent finite-dimensional optimization problem with an explicit objective function. - It suggests using a projected gradient descent algorithm to efficiently solve the reformulated problem and find robust recourse actions.- The framework is flexible enough to allow extensions like hedging against mixture weight uncertainty and minimizing the worst-case component probability.- Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed DiRRAc framework generates recourses that are more robust to distribution shifts compared to prior methods.In summary, the key contribution is a principled distributionally robust optimization approach to generate recourse actions that are likely to remain valid even when the model parameters shift due to data distribution changes over time. The reformulation and projection algorithm also make the framework computationally tractable.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper proposes a novel framework called Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) to generate recourse actions that are robust to distribution shifts in the underlying model. This addresses an important limitation of prior work on recourse generation, which assumes the model is static. The idea of using distributionally robust optimization to handle model uncertainty is novel in the context of recourse generation.- Most prior work focuses on generating recourses for specific model types like linear models or tree ensembles. In contrast, the DiRRAc framework is model-agnostic as long as a local linear approximation is available. This makes it more broadly applicable. The paper shows how DiRRAc can be applied to both linear and nonlinear models.- The paper thoroughly compares DiRRAc against several state-of-the-art recourse generation methods like ROAR, Wachter et al., and AR. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate DiRRAc generates more robust recourses while maintaining low recourse costs.- The paper discusses multiple extensions of the core DiRRAc framework like handling uncertainty in mixture weights and minimizing worst-case modal probability. This showcases the flexibility of the distributionally robust optimization approach for generating robust recourses.- The convergence guarantees for the projected gradient descent algorithm and the closed-form expression for the worst-case probability make DiRRAc amenable to efficient computation.Overall, the proposed DiRRAc framework seems to advance the state-of-the-art in recourse generation by addressing model shifts, applying to broader model classes, and outperforming existing methods empirically while retaining computational tractability. The distributionally robust optimization perspective is a novel and promising direction for recourse generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending the framework to handle non-linear classifiers, as discussed in Remark 1. The authors suggest using approaches like LIME to locally approximate non-linear classifiers with linear models, then applying their framework.- Considering different designs for the ambiguity sets used to model distributional shifts, as mentioned in the concluding remarks. The authors note their framework relies fundamentally on using Gelbrich distance to construct the ambiguity sets, and different choices could lead to different theoretical and computational properties.- Incorporating additional forms of robustness into the framework, such as being robust to adversarial examples or other perturbations, as briefly noted in the conclusion. - Evaluating the framework on a broader range of real-world datasets and machine learning models. The authors demonstrate results on a few sample datasets, but further empirical analysis could provide more insight.- Extending the framework to classification settings beyond binary classification. The current setup focuses on binary linear classifiers, but the ideas could potentially be generalized.- Developing methodologies to automatically select good values for the key hyperparameters of the framework, such as the radii of the ambiguity sets. The authors currently select these via experimentation.- Considering ensemble methods and how they could complement the distributionally robust optimization approach for finding robust recourses. The authors briefly explore ensemble variants but suggest more work is needed.- Comparing the robustness and performance trade-offs achieved by the framework to other related methods in more detail. The authors provide some initial comparisons but deeper analysis could be useful.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a framework called Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) to generate recourse actions that are robust to shifts in the underlying data distribution. Existing methods for generating recourse actions assume the machine learning model does not change over time. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice due to data distribution shifts which cause the model parameters to change as well. To address this, the DiRRAc framework models the future model parameters as a mixture of distributions and finds a recourse action that minimizes the worst-case probability of an unfavorable outcome over this mixture distribution ambiguity set. The paper shows that the DiRRAc problem can be reformulated into an equivalent finite-dimensional optimization problem with an explicit objective function. This enables the use of projected gradient descent to find an optimal robust recourse action. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the recourse actions generated by DiRRAc have significantly higher validity under distribution shifts compared to existing methods like ROAR, while also maintaining low recourse costs. The paper also discusses several extensions of the DiRRAc framework, such as handling ambiguity in the mixture weights and minimizing the worst-case conditional probability over mixture components.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new framework called Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) for generating recourse actions that are robust to distribution shifts in the model parameters. The key idea is to model the future model parameters as a mixture of distributions, where each component represents a type of model shift. The paper formulates a min-max optimization problem to find a recourse action that minimizes the worst-case probability of unfavorable outcome under the mixture distribution. The inner maximization problem involves an ambiguity set defined by the Gelbrich distance, which allows reformulating the infinite-dimensional problem into an equivalent finite-dimensional one. The paper suggests a projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem. Extensions are provided to handle parametric Gaussian assumptions and mixture weight uncertainty. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed DiRRAc framework in generating recourses that are more robust compared to several baselines.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a framework called Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) to generate a recourse action that is robust to shifts in the underlying data distribution. The key idea is to model the future model parameters as a mixture of distributions, where each component represents a type of data shift. Then it formulates a min-max optimization problem, where the inner maximization is over an ambiguity set containing distributions close to the nominal mixture distribution. By using the Gelbrich distance to construct the ambiguity set, the inner maximization can be solved analytically, leading to a closed-form reformulation of the min-max problem into a finite-dimensional optimization problem. The paper suggests using projected gradient descent to solve this reformulated problem and find a robust recourse action. Additional extensions are proposed, including handling ambiguity in the mixture weights and minimizing the worst-case probability over mixture components. Overall, the distributionally robust optimization approach with the Gelbrich ambiguity set allows generating recourses robust to data shifts while avoiding conservatism.
