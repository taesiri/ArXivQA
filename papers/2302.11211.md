# [Distributionally Robust Recourse Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11211)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is to develop a method for generating robust counterfactual explanations that remain valid even when the underlying model changes due to distribution shift. The paper notes that existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations assume the model is static. However, in practice machine learning models are often retrained due to distribution shifts, causing the model parameters to change. This means counterfactuals generated on the original model may become invalid on the shifted model. To address this, the authors propose a method called Distributionally Robust Counterfactual Explanations (DRCE). The key idea is to generate counterfactuals that are robust against distributional shifts in the model parameters. This is done by modeling the future parameters as a mixture of distributions and finding counterfactuals that minimize the worst-case probability of having the wrong prediction under this mixture model.In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling distributional uncertainty in the model parameters and finding counterfactuals that are robust against this uncertainty will produce explanations that remain valid even when the model changes due to shifts in the data distribution. The DRCE method is proposed to test this hypothesis.
