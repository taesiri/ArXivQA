# [Diffusion-based Iterative Counterfactual Explanations for Fetal   Ultrasound Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08700)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In obstetric ultrasound imaging, capturing high-quality standard plane (SP) images is critical for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of the fetus. However, acquiring such images is challenging due to factors like maternal BMI, fetus position, and sonographer expertise. 

- Low-quality, non-standard plane (NSP) images lead to incorrect measurements and clinical assessments. There is a need for methods to enhance image quality to aid diagnosis.

Method:
- The paper proposes a diffusion-based iterative counterfactual explanation (Diff-ICE) approach to transform low-quality NSP ultrasound images into higher-quality SP images of the same anatomy. 

- A classifier is trained to predict image quality and provide guidance. Diff-ICE iteratively refines counterfactual images over multiple reverse diffusion steps to increase classifier confidence, while using a perceptual loss term to maintain fidelity to the input.

- This allows more global changes compared to prior counterfactual methods that use sparsity constraints or focus only on localized changes.

Contributions:
- Introduces diffusion-based counterfactuals for enhancing quality of fetal ultrasound images, enabling broad changes from NSP inputs to SP outputs.

- Proposes an iterative scheme with perceptual loss guidance that increases counterfactual confidence and validity over multiple diffusion steps.

- Demonstrates qualitative and quantitative experiments showing Diff-ICE can plausibly transform low-quality inputs into more realistic higher-quality SP images.

- Discusses promising applications in clinician training by providing visual feedback and also improving downstream diagnosis from difficult-to-capture scans.

In summary, the key innovation is an iterative diffusion-based approach to generate realistic quality enhancements as counterfactual explanations for fetal ultrasound images, with evaluations showing considerable improvements.
