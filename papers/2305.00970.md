# ArK: Augmented Reality with Knowledge Interactive Emergent Ability

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is:How can we develop an AI agent that can generate and understand scenes in physical and virtual worlds by effectively leveraging knowledge encoded in large pre-trained models along with contextual information?The key hypothesis is that by developing a knowledge and memory based interactive agent called "Augmented Reality with Knowledge Inference Interaction (ArK)", it can enable high quality scene generation and understanding in unseen environments. Specifically, the ArK agent aims to:- Transfer knowledge encoded in large pre-trained models like GPT-4 and DALL-E to novel tasks and scenarios.- Interactively collect external multi-sensory information from humans to understand user intent.- Reason over the extracted knowledge and user interactions to generate realistic and coherent scenes.The core hypothesis is that by combining large foundation models with the ArK agent's ability to retrieve and reason over knowledge and memory, the system can generate high quality 2D and 3D scenes without needing large amounts of training data for each new scenario.In summary, the key research question is how to develop an interactive agent that can leverage knowledge transfer and reasoning to enable generalized scene generation and understanding across different environments. The ArK mechanism is hypothesized to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new approach called Augmented Reality with Knowledge Interactive Emergentism (ArK) for interactive generation and editing of scenes in virtual or real worlds. Specifically:- They develop an "infinite agent" that can transfer knowledge from general foundation models (e.g. GPT, DALL-E) to novel scenarios for scene understanding and generation. - The core of their approach is an emerging mechanism called ArK, which leverages knowledge to generate scenes in unseen environments. - ArK demonstrates "micro-actions" of cross-modality, using models to collect relevant knowledge for each task from the physical world. It also shows "macro-behaviors" of reality-agnostic, improving interactions in mixed reality.- They validate ArK on tasks like conversational 2D image generation, 3D scene creation in VR, and 3D scene editing in mixed reality. Experiments show it significantly improves scene quality compared to baselines.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the ArK approach to incorporate knowledge into interactive scene generation and editing in virtual/real worlds. This demonstrates the potential of using knowledge and reasoning to enhance generative AI systems like those for metaverse and gaming.
