# ArK: Augmented Reality with Knowledge Interactive Emergent Ability

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is:How can we develop an AI agent that can generate and understand scenes in physical and virtual worlds by effectively leveraging knowledge encoded in large pre-trained models along with contextual information?The key hypothesis is that by developing a knowledge and memory based interactive agent called "Augmented Reality with Knowledge Inference Interaction (ArK)", it can enable high quality scene generation and understanding in unseen environments. Specifically, the ArK agent aims to:- Transfer knowledge encoded in large pre-trained models like GPT-4 and DALL-E to novel tasks and scenarios.- Interactively collect external multi-sensory information from humans to understand user intent.- Reason over the extracted knowledge and user interactions to generate realistic and coherent scenes.The core hypothesis is that by combining large foundation models with the ArK agent's ability to retrieve and reason over knowledge and memory, the system can generate high quality 2D and 3D scenes without needing large amounts of training data for each new scenario.In summary, the key research question is how to develop an interactive agent that can leverage knowledge transfer and reasoning to enable generalized scene generation and understanding across different environments. The ArK mechanism is hypothesized to achieve this goal.
