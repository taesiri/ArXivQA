# [Uncertainty-Aware Shared Autonomy System with Hierarchical Conservative   Skill Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02488)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware shared autonomy system to enable robots to learn manipulation skills more safely through human demonstrations and corrections. A hierarchical skill network (HSN) is introduced to learn skills at an abstract level, facilitating generalization and scalability. The HSN consists of a high-level policy that infers a skill embedding from observations and a low-level policy that decodes the embedding into robot actions. To address uncertainty, Monte-Carlo dropout is applied to the high-level policy to estimate skill uncertainty. This uncertainty measure modulates the skill planning by blending the current skill with the previous skill as well as reducing the action execution speed, enabling more conservative and stable skill demonstrations. The shared autonomy system utilizes a VR interface for teleoperation and implements constrained control methods to improve safety. Experiments on pouring and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the capability to learn adaptable skills that can handle environmental changes. The conservative skill inference facilitates more stable learning compared to non-uncertainty-aware methods. Overall, the proposed approach contributes towards safe and sample-efficient robot learning through human-robot interaction.
