# [Uncertainty-Aware Shared Autonomy System with Hierarchical Conservative   Skill Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02488)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware shared autonomy system to enable robots to learn manipulation skills more safely through human demonstrations and corrections. A hierarchical skill network (HSN) is introduced to learn skills at an abstract level, facilitating generalization and scalability. The HSN consists of a high-level policy that infers a skill embedding from observations and a low-level policy that decodes the embedding into robot actions. To address uncertainty, Monte-Carlo dropout is applied to the high-level policy to estimate skill uncertainty. This uncertainty measure modulates the skill planning by blending the current skill with the previous skill as well as reducing the action execution speed, enabling more conservative and stable skill demonstrations. The shared autonomy system utilizes a VR interface for teleoperation and implements constrained control methods to improve safety. Experiments on pouring and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the capability to learn adaptable skills that can handle environmental changes. The conservative skill inference facilitates more stable learning compared to non-uncertainty-aware methods. Overall, the proposed approach contributes towards safe and sample-efficient robot learning through human-robot interaction.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware shared autonomy system with hierarchical conservative skill inference to enable robots to learn manipulation skills more safely through human demonstrations and corrections.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The proposal of an uncertainty-aware shared autonomy system that enables robots to learn manipulation skills more conservatively from human demonstrations and corrections. This accounts for uncertainties and aims to increase tolerance for human errors during the learning process.

2) The introduction of a hierarchical skill network (HSN) to facilitate skill learning and inference at a more abstract level. The HSN consists of high-level and low-level policies to generate skill embeddings and decode them into robot actions.

3) A method for conservative skill inference using Monte-Carlo dropout in the high-level skill policy network to estimate skill uncertainty. This uncertainty measure allows more deliberate skill planning and slower action execution for stability.

4) The detailed design and implementation of a shared autonomy system setup from scratch for robot manipulation skill learning. This includes constrained VR teleoperation, demonstration dataset collection, real-time communication, etc. 

5) Experimental validation of multi-configurable pouring and pick-and-place skill learning using the proposed system. Evaluations in static and dynamic environments demonstrate adaptation skills and transition capabilities between tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and demonstration of an uncertainty-aware shared autonomy approach to enhance the stability and robustness of manipulation skill learning from human guidance.
