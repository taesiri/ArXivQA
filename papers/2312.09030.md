 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a dual branch network (DBN) for accurate printed mathematical expression recognition (PMER). The key innovation is the use of two branches to jointly learn local symbol-level features and global image-level features, in order to capture more contextual information that is crucial for recognizing mathematical expressions. A Context Coupling Module (CCM) is introduced to interactively couple the global and local contexts so that the contextual clues become highly correlated with each symbol. Additionally, a Dynamic Soft Target (DST) strategy is proposed to leverage the statistics of model predictions during training to capture similarities between symbol categories and generate better supervision. Experiments on two PMER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed DBN framework. By effectively fusing global and local contexts and exploiting inter-category similarities, the model is able to accurately recognize mathematical expressions, especially those containing semantically-correlated symbols that pose challenges for previous methods.
