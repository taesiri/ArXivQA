# [Trajeglish: Learning the Language of Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04535)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Self-driving vehicles need to be able to simulate dynamic driving scenarios with realistic agent interactions in order to safely share the road with human drivers. However, existing approaches for imitative traffic modeling struggle to capture multi-agent coordination and reactivity. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose "Trajeglish", an autoregressive transformer-based model for generating diverse, interaction-rich driving scenarios. Key aspects:

1) Simple data-driven discretization ("tokenization") of trajectories to centimeter-level accuracy using a small vocabulary of 384 motion "tokens". This allows exact likelihood modeling.

2) Autoregressive transformer architecture that conditions on map info and initial agent states. Predicts token distributions one agent at a time to enable test-time interaction. Models intra-timestep coordination between agents.

3) Sampling strategy that extends scenarios spatially and temporally for long diverse rollouts at test time.

Contributions:

- State-of-the-art performance on Waymo Motion Prediction benchmark, especially on interaction metrics (9.9% better). Realism comparable to real-world logs.

- Ablation studies quantifying value of coordination modeling and map conditioning. Analysis of learned representations and dataset scaling.

- Model reactiveness enables practical applications like AV testing against simulated road users. Fine-tuning shows transferability to other datasets like nuScenes.

In summary, Trajeglish advances multi-agent traffic modeling via transformer-based discrete sequence generation. Key innovation is dynamically factorizable token-level autoregression with attend-decide architecture for agent reactivity. Sets new state-of-the-art on traffic modeling benchmarks.
