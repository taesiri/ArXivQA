# [Trajeglish: Learning the Language of Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04535)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Trajeglish, an autoregressive model for generating realistic multi-agent driving scenarios. The key idea is to discretize trajectories into a sequence of motion "tokens" using a simple data-driven method called k-disks. This allows them to model complex distributions over future states while retaining efficient sampling and density estimation. They then train a transformer-based model to predict token sequences in an order-sensitive way, conditioning on map context and agent states. Trajeglish samples diverse, interactive rollouts that significantly outperform prior work on the Waymo benchmark, especially on interaction metrics. Ablations validate the importance of modeling intra-timestep dependencies and long-range context. The method also shows promising scalability and transfer learning abilities. Overall, Trajeglish pushes the state-of-the-art in imitative traffic modeling through an intuitive application of discrete sequence modeling. By better simulating human driving dynamics, it has the potential to improve the safety of autonomous vehicles.
