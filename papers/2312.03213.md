# [Bootstrap Your Own Variance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03213)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Bootstrap Your Own Variance (BYOV), a method that combines Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL), a self-supervised learning algorithm, with Bayes by Backprop (BBB), a Bayesian deep learning technique for estimating model uncertainty. BYOV extends BBB to the self-supervised setting by learning a posterior distribution over model parameters using a generalized ELBO objective. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BYOV improves calibration and reliability over deterministic BYOL, and the learned uncertainty correlates with that of supervised Bayesian models. BYOV also enables better pruning than magnitude-based approaches via the signal-to-noise ratio of the posterior. Overall, BYOV provides a way to quantify uncertainty in self-supervised models to improve reliability and interpretability without the need for labels. Key results show improved expected calibration error, Brier score, out-of-distribution robustness, and signal-to-noise ratio based pruning over the BYOL baseline.
