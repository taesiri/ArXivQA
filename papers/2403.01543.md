# [Efficient Action Counting with Dynamic Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01543)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Temporal repetition counting (TRC) aims to count the number of repetitive action cycles in a video. 
- Existing methods rely on similarity correlation matrices, which have quadratic computational complexity and do not scale well to long videos.  
- TRC also faces unique challenges compared to action detection: (1) recognizing open-set actions that are not predefined, and (2) recognizing repetitive actions with identical content.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework that represents each action cycle with an "action query", reducing complexity from quadratic to linear.
- To address the open-set challenge, Dynamic Action Query (DAQ) is proposed to dynamically initialize the decoder's queries using relevant encoder features, allowing adaptive attention without predefined classes.  
- For recognizing repetitive actions, Inter-Query Contrastive Learning (ICL) is proposed to group similar queries together while separating distracting ones.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective of TRC as setting prediction using action queries, with linear complexity.
- DAQ for open-set recognition by dynamic query initialization from encoder features. 
- ICL to recognize repetitive actions by contrastive feature learning among queries.
- State-of-the-art results on RepCountA and UCFRep datasets, with improved efficiency and ability to handle varying cycle lengths.

In summary, the paper makes TRC more practical by improving efficiency, generalization ability and handling of repetition. The core ideas of DAQ and ICL allow adaptive recognition of repetitive actions in an open-set manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for temporal repetition counting that uses a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture with dynamic action queries and inter-query contrastive learning to efficiently detect repetitive action cycles in videos with linear complexity, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper provides a novel perspective to tackle the temporal repetition counting (TRC) problem using a simple yet effective representation for action cycles. This reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear and makes the method robust to varying action periods and video lengths.

2. The paper proposes Dynamic Action Query (DAQ) to guide the model to focus on the "action of interest" and improve generalization ability across different actions, without needing manual definition of action categories.

3. The paper introduces Inter-query Contrastive Learning (ICL) to facilitate learning repetitive action representations and to distinguish these actions from distractions like background noise. 

4. By addressing the scalability issue and unique challenges of TRC, the proposed method notably surpasses state-of-the-art methods on two challenging benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The method effectively handles various action periods and video lengths, offering a significant advance for the practical application of TRC technologies.

In summary, the main contributions are: a novel efficient representation, the DAQ and ICL designs to address key TRC challenges, superior performance over state-of-the-arts, and better practical applicability by handling diverse video contents.
