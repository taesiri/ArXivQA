# [Consistent and Asymptotically Unbiased Estimation of Proper Calibration   Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08589)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a general approach for estimating all proper calibration errors, including a novel estimator for the commonly used but previously difficult to estimate Kullback-Leibler calibration error. The proposed estimator uses kernel density estimation to approximate the conditional expectation and is shown to be consistent, asymptotically unbiased, and to have bias that converges at rate O(n^{-1}). The estimator can be used to estimate any proper calibration error induced by a Bregman divergence. The authors also prove an information monotonicity result showing refinement/sharpness is optimized in neural networks during training, regardless of the loss being used. This gives a more general perspective on information flow in neural networks. Experiments validate the statistical properties on simulated and real data, demonstrate the new Kullback-Leibler error estimator, and showcase an application of selecting appropriate post-hoc calibration methods based on the calibration error objective.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Proper scoring rules like log loss and Brier score are used to evaluate probabilistic predictions. These scoring rules decompose into calibration error and refinement terms based on an associated Bregman divergence. 
- While calibration error has gained attention recently, there is no general estimator for all proper calibration errors including the KL divergence induced calibration error from log loss.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator for all proper calibration errors based on kernel density estimation of the conditional expectation.
- The estimator works by substituting an estimate of the conditional expectation into the Bregman divergence formula for any calibration error. 
- Specifically, it introduces an estimator for the KL divergence calibration error which is induced by the commonly used log loss.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a general estimator for all proper calibration errors that is consistent, asymptotically unbiased and differentiable.
- Introduces the KL calibration error for probabilistic classification.
- Shows that model sharpness is equivalent to an f-divergence between class-conditional distributions. This allows to formulate a general information monotonicity principle for neural networks beyond mutual information.
- Empirically evaluates the proposed estimator and shows its utility for selecting appropriate post-hoc calibration methods based on the calibration error of interest.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel general purpose estimator for all proper calibration errors that enables calibration evaluation and monitoring in probabilistic classification for machine learning models.
