# [Consistent and Asymptotically Unbiased Estimation of Proper Calibration   Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08589)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a general approach for estimating all proper calibration errors, including a novel estimator for the commonly used but previously difficult to estimate Kullback-Leibler calibration error. The proposed estimator uses kernel density estimation to approximate the conditional expectation and is shown to be consistent, asymptotically unbiased, and to have bias that converges at rate O(n^{-1}). The estimator can be used to estimate any proper calibration error induced by a Bregman divergence. The authors also prove an information monotonicity result showing refinement/sharpness is optimized in neural networks during training, regardless of the loss being used. This gives a more general perspective on information flow in neural networks. Experiments validate the statistical properties on simulated and real data, demonstrate the new Kullback-Leibler error estimator, and showcase an application of selecting appropriate post-hoc calibration methods based on the calibration error objective.
