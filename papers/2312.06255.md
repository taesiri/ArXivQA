## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel ensemble interpretation methodology to improve the stability and fidelity of interpretable machine learning models. The key idea is to integrate the explanation results from multiple interpretation methods to obtain a more comprehensive, multi-perspective understanding of the model's predictions. Specifically, the paper first constructs a unified paradigm to describe different interpretation methods, representing them as a weighted combination of feature functions. It then defines an "interpretation list" to encode the feature importance ranking and contribution ordering from an interpreter. By applying composite mappings, different interpretation methods can be transformed into such lists. Ensemble interpretation is achieved by aggregating multiple lists into one integrated list, using a scoring and ranking mechanism. To evaluate interpretation performance, the paper also introduces a supervised metric measuring consistency with human-provided reference rankings. Experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate that ensemble interpretation achieves better stability and fidelity compared to individual methods. An application in feature selection further shows improved model generalization ability. Overall, this ensemble view of combining multiple interpreters provides an innovative direction for more trustworthy AI.
