# [Ensemble Interpretation: A Unified Method for Interpretable Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06255)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel ensemble interpretation methodology to improve the stability and fidelity of interpretable machine learning models. The key idea is to integrate the explanation results from multiple interpretation methods to obtain a more comprehensive, multi-perspective understanding of the model's predictions. Specifically, the paper first constructs a unified paradigm to describe different interpretation methods, representing them as a weighted combination of feature functions. It then defines an "interpretation list" to encode the feature importance ranking and contribution ordering from an interpreter. By applying composite mappings, different interpretation methods can be transformed into such lists. Ensemble interpretation is achieved by aggregating multiple lists into one integrated list, using a scoring and ranking mechanism. To evaluate interpretation performance, the paper also introduces a supervised metric measuring consistency with human-provided reference rankings. Experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate that ensemble interpretation achieves better stability and fidelity compared to individual methods. An application in feature selection further shows improved model generalization ability. Overall, this ensemble view of combining multiple interpreters provides an innovative direction for more trustworthy AI.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing interpretability methods for machine learning models have issues with stability and fidelity. Different methods can produce conflicting explanations. 
- There is a lack of theoretical foundation to unify and evaluate interpretation methods.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel ensemble interpretation approach that integrates explanations from multiple interpretation methods to produce more comprehensive and stable explanations.  
- Define a unified paradigm to represent different interpretation methods. Map methods to a common "interpretation list" representation.
- Ensemble multiple interpretation lists into one list that aggregates explanations.
- Propose a supervised evaluation metric to quantitatively assess interpretation methods based on human expert knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Apply the concept of ensemble learning to model interpretation to enhance stability.
- Present the "interpretation list" to unify different interpretation methods into one paradigm based on feature contribution.
- Algorithm to ensemble multiple interpretation lists into one.
- A supervised evaluation metric for interpretation methods using prior expert knowledge.
- Demonstrate improved stability and consistency of ensemble interpretation over individual methods.
- Show application to feature selection, significantly improving model generalization ability.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel idea of ensembling interpretations to address stability issues. It provides a unified theory and evaluation framework for interpretation methods. The ensemble approach is shown empirically to produce more consistent explanations according to expert knowledge. When used for feature selection, it also substantially improves model performance.
