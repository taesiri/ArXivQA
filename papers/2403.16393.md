# [Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED) for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted, making their dependability and protection against errors an important issue. 
- Existing error detection schemes require access to the internal nodes of the models, but many LLMs are provided as black boxes without such access.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED) which detects errors solely based on features extracted from the output text generated by the LLM.
- It exploits the observation that valid text follows certain linguistic rules and patterns, so errors can be exposed when those are violated.

Key Contributions:
- CLED extracts linguistic features from the output text like invalid character sequences, average word length etc. and feeds them to a concurrent classifier.
- It does not require any modifications or access to the LLM, making it applicable even to closed models.
- CLED is evaluated on two models - T5 and OPUS-MT, showing 90%+ error detection rates at low overhead.
- The same linguistic features are effective for both models, demonstrating the generality of the approach across models and tasks. 
- There is flexibility to tradeoff between detection rate and overhead by tuning the decision threshold.

In summary, the paper presents a novel concurrent error detection technique for LLMs based on linguistic properties of the output text. It shows high detection rates across models at low overhead without needing access to the model internals.
