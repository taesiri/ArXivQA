# [Randomized Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Uncertainty   Quantification in High-Dimensional Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06177)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a physics-informed machine learning method called randomized PICKLE (rPICKLE) for uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The method represents the unknown parameters and states using conditional Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansions (CKLEs) and formulates the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inverse solution as a least-squares minimization problem over the CKLE coefficients (PICKLE method). To quantify uncertainty, rPICKLE generates samples from the posterior distribution by adding random noise to the PICKLE loss function and minimizing over many noise realizations. The method is applied to a groundwater flow inverse problem in two cases - a low-dimensional problem with 15 parameters where rPICKLE matches a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) reference posterior well, and a high-dimensional 2000 parameter case where rPICKLE generates inference efficiently but HMC fails. Key results show rPICKLE avoids issues related to complex geometric posterior features that limit HMC as dimensionality and physics-related constraints increase. The computational robustness of rPICKLE makes it well-suited for uncertainty quantification in large-scale PDE-based inverse problems.
