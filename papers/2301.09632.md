# [HexPlane: A Fast Representation for Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09632)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to represent dynamic 3D scenes efficiently using an explicit representation rather than a costly implicit neural representation like NeRF. The key hypothesis is that decomposing a 4D spacetime volume into six explicit feature planes (HexPlane) can provide a simple yet effective representation for modeling and rendering high-quality novel views of dynamic scenes.The problems the paper aims to solve are:1) High memory usage of naively representing dynamic scenes as 4D volumes. The paper proposes factorizing the 4D volume into six feature planes to reduce the memory footprint.2) Sparse observations in dynamic scenes from moving cameras. The paper proposes sharing information across time via the six planes to overcome this. The HexPlane representation is shown to be efficient, reducing training times by over 100x compared to implicit methods like DyNeRF while achieving equal or higher rendering quality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the HexPlane design for novel view synthesis of complex, real-world dynamic scenes.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicit factorization into six feature planes can enable an efficient yet high-quality representation for dynamic 3D scenes. The experiments support this claim and demonstrate large improvements in speed over purely implicit methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing HexPlane, an explicit representation for dynamic 3D scenes. HexPlane represents a 4D spacetime volume using six feature planes spanning pairs of axes (e.g. XY, ZT). To compute features for a point, it extracts vectors from each plane and fuses them into a single vector. This allows efficiently querying features for spacetime points. When combined with a small MLP decoder, HexPlane enables high quality novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes, matching prior implicit methods but with over 100x speedup. The key benefits are:- Memory efficient - HexPlane scales quadratically rather than quartically with resolution.- Encourages information sharing across time - Planes like XY operate only on spatial axes, allowing reuse across timesteps. - Simple and flexible - Makes minimal assumptions about scene, robust to different fusion mechanisms, coordinates, decoders.- High quality results - Matches prior work on complex datasets while accelerating training over 100x. Enables real-time rendering.In summary, the paper proposes HexPlane as an elegant, efficient, and effective explicit representation for modeling dynamic 3D scenes. It demonstrates substantial speedups over prior implicit methods with comparable quality and generality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes HexPlane, an explicit representation for dynamic 3D scenes using six feature planes along pairs of coordinate axes (XY, ZT etc), which computes features for spacetime points via efficient sampling and fusion to enable high quality novel view synthesis hundreds of times faster than implicit methods.
