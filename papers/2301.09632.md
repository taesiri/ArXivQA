# [HexPlane: A Fast Representation for Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09632)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to represent dynamic 3D scenes efficiently using an explicit representation rather than a costly implicit neural representation like NeRF. The key hypothesis is that decomposing a 4D spacetime volume into six explicit feature planes (HexPlane) can provide a simple yet effective representation for modeling and rendering high-quality novel views of dynamic scenes.

The problems the paper aims to solve are:

1) High memory usage of naively representing dynamic scenes as 4D volumes. The paper proposes factorizing the 4D volume into six feature planes to reduce the memory footprint.

2) Sparse observations in dynamic scenes from moving cameras. The paper proposes sharing information across time via the six planes to overcome this. 

The HexPlane representation is shown to be efficient, reducing training times by over 100x compared to implicit methods like DyNeRF while achieving equal or higher rendering quality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the HexPlane design for novel view synthesis of complex, real-world dynamic scenes.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicit factorization into six feature planes can enable an efficient yet high-quality representation for dynamic 3D scenes. The experiments support this claim and demonstrate large improvements in speed over purely implicit methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing HexPlane, an explicit representation for dynamic 3D scenes. HexPlane represents a 4D spacetime volume using six feature planes spanning pairs of axes (e.g. XY, ZT). To compute features for a point, it extracts vectors from each plane and fuses them into a single vector. This allows efficiently querying features for spacetime points. When combined with a small MLP decoder, HexPlane enables high quality novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes, matching prior implicit methods but with over 100x speedup. The key benefits are:

- Memory efficient - HexPlane scales quadratically rather than quartically with resolution.

- Encourages information sharing across time - Planes like XY operate only on spatial axes, allowing reuse across timesteps. 

- Simple and flexible - Makes minimal assumptions about scene, robust to different fusion mechanisms, coordinates, decoders.

- High quality results - Matches prior work on complex datasets while accelerating training over 100x. Enables real-time rendering.

In summary, the paper proposes HexPlane as an elegant, efficient, and effective explicit representation for modeling dynamic 3D scenes. It demonstrates substantial speedups over prior implicit methods with comparable quality and generality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes HexPlane, an explicit representation for dynamic 3D scenes using six feature planes along pairs of coordinate axes (XY, ZT etc), which computes features for spacetime points via efficient sampling and fusion to enable high quality novel view synthesis hundreds of times faster than implicit methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to prior work on dynamic 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis:

- It proposes a new explicit representation (HexPlane) for modeling dynamic scenes, as opposed to purely implicit representations like previous methods building on NeRF. This leads to dramatically faster training and inference.

- The HexPlane representation uses six 2D feature planes to represent the 4D spacetime volume. This provides a good balance between model capacity and efficiency. Prior work either used independent 3D volumes per timestep, which lacks information sharing, or attempted to share 3D volumes across time, which is still inefficient. 

- The method makes minimal assumptions about scene properties like deformation fields or category-specific shape priors. It aims for a simple, general representation. Other recent papers have used more complex scene-specific assumptions to try to improve results.

- Experiments show the HexPlane matches or exceeds the image quality of state-of-the-art implicit models on datasets of both multi-view and monocular video, while being over 100x faster. This demonstrates the representation's efficiency.

- The work focuses on the representation itself. It does not aim to match the absolute state-of-the-art performance by incorporating orthogonal tricks, as some other concurrent work has done. The ablations do aim to demonstrate the robustness of the HexPlane design.

- The paper situates the work in the context of other hybrid/explicit representations for static scenes. It aims to bring similar benefits to the dynamic setting. Concurrent work has also started exploring explicit models for video.

In summary, the key novelty is in proposing the elegant HexPlane representation for 4D scenes. Experiments validate it matches implicit models in quality but with dramatically improved speeds. The work explores an exciting direction of designing explicit models for complex 4D data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Apply HexPlane to other tasks beyond novel view synthesis, such as dynamic scene generation and editing. The paper mentions that their method makes minimal assumptions about the underlying scene, so it may be useful for a variety of applications related to modeling dynamic 3D scenes over time.

- Improve HexPlane's performance on scenarios with very sparse input views, such as monocular video. The authors suggest incorporating ideas like deformation fields and category-specific priors (e.g. for humans or cars) that have been effectively used in other dynamic scene modeling methods. This could help in cases where there are insufficient views to reconstruct details.

- Explore stronger regularization techniques and losses to reduce color jittering and artifacts in the synthesized views. The paper mentions total variation and depth smoothness losses, but more tailored spatial-temporal regularizers could further improve results.

- Model foreground and background separately, like in NeRF++. This could help resolve issues at scene boundaries and represent unbounded scenes more effectively. 

- Optimize the spherical harmonics variant of HexPlane. Using SH coefficients directly instead of a MLP to decode colors/opacities could enable even faster rendering, but the paper found this challenging to optimize for dynamic scenes.

- Apply different basis functions for different clips of a long video, instead of a single shared basis. This could improve adaptation to varied scene dynamics over time.

- Use HexPlane representations for related tasks like dynamic scene generation from text or other modalities. The recent MAV3D work adopts HexPlanes for text-to-scene generation.

So in summary, the authors propose many intriguing ideas to extend HexPlane to new applications and improve its reconstruction quality, speed, and robustness. Leveraging complementary techniques like deformation modeling and exploring alternative decoding mechanisms like SH seem like promising directions for future work.

The paper proposes HexPlane, a novel explicit representation for dynamic 3D scenes. HexPlane contains six feature planes spanning each pair of coordinate axes (e.g. XY, ZT). To compute features for points in spacetime, it extracts vectors from each plane and fuses them into a single vector. This vector is multiplied by a matrix to produce the final point features.

It is shown to be robust to different fusion mechanisms for the per-plane features, coordinate systems, and color decoding methods. HexPlane provides an elegant, lightweight explicit representation for modeling dynamic scenes. By decoupling model capacity and speed, it enables high quality novel view synthesis while being fast enough for real world use cases. The paper demonstrates exciting possibilities for using explicit representations in modeling dynamic content.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel explicit representation called HexPlane for modeling dynamic 3D scenes. HexPlane contains six feature planes spanning each pair of coordinate axes (e.g. XY, ZT). To compute features for a point in spacetime, it extracts feature vectors from each plane by interpolation, multiplies vectors from paired planes, concatenates the multiplied results into a single vector, and multiplies this by a matrix to get the final point features.

This method is shown to be highly efficient, providing comparable image quality to prior implicit methods but with over 100x speedup in training and rendering. By storing features explicitly and avoiding costly MLP evaluations, HexPlane enables high-quality novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes in a fast and memory-efficient manner.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of efficiently representing dynamic 3D scenes for novel view synthesis. Some key points:

- Prior methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) rely on implicit neural representations using MLPs. This is slow for rendering novel views due to the need for many MLP evaluations per pixel.

- For static 3D scenes, recent work has shown speedups using explicit representations like voxels, point clouds, etc paired with small MLPs. But extending these to dynamic scenes is challenging.

- The key challenges are: (1) high memory usage when naively representing a 4D spacetime volume, and (2) sparse observations from cameras over time.

- The paper proposes a novel explicit representation called HexPlane to address these challenges. It represents a dynamic scene using 6 planes of features spanning pairs of axes (e.g. XY, ZT). 

- HexPlane allows efficient lookup of features for 4D points. Combined with a tiny MLP it achieves high quality view synthesis hundreds of times faster than implicit representations.

- Experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate HexPlane matches prior work in quality but is over 100x faster. Extensive ablations validate the design.

In summary, the key contribution is an explicit representation (HexPlane) for dynamic scenes that achieves unprecedented speed for high quality novel view synthesis. This could enable new applications with dynamic content.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes HexPlane, a novel explicit representation for dynamic 3D scenes that achieves high quality novel view synthesis while being over 100x faster than prior implicit methods. HexPlane represents a dynamic scene using six learned feature planes, three spanning spatial dimensions (XY, XZ, YZ) and three spanning spatial-temporal dimensions (XT, YT, ZT). To compute a feature vector for a point in spacetime, HexPlane projects the point onto each feature plane via bilinear sampling, fuses the per-plane features, and multiplies with a learned matrix to get the final feature. This elegant and symmetric design reduces memory consumption to be quadratic instead of cubic in scene resolution. Pairing the explicit HexPlane representation with a small MLP decoder leads to impressive results on challenging real-world dynamic scene datasets, matching prior state-of-the-art image quality while accelerating training by over two orders of magnitude. The authors demonstrate HexPlane's representational power, efficiency, and robustness through quantitative experiments and ablations on multiple datasets and model variations. Overall, HexPlane provides an effective explicit representation for dynamic scenes that can broadly enable real-time novel view synthesis and other applications.
