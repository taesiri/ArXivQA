# [Communication-Efficient Multimodal Federated Learning: Joint Modality   and Client Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
This paper addresses key challenges in multimodal federated learning (mmFL), where clients collect data across multiple modalities and have communication constraints preventing them from uploading all locally trained models to the server. Specifically, it tackles: (i) client heterogeneity in terms of missing modalities, (ii) balancing performance and communication overhead given varying data sizes and complexities across modalities, and (iii) determining the impact of each modality and client on overall model performance. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes mmFedMC, a new mmFL methodology with two key components:

1) Modality selection: Clients evaluate modalities based on (i) impact (Shapley value), (ii) model size (communication overhead), and (iii) recency (upload frequency) to determine priority for uploading to server. This allows selective communication of most valuable modalities.

2) Client selection: Server selects a subset of clients to upload models based on lower local loss. This accounts for client heterogeneity and focuses on clients that better converge modality models.

Only selected modality models are uploaded and aggregated on the server to enhance generalization. Clients retain personalized ensemble models for deployment, preserving privacy.

Main Contributions:

- Decision-level fusion approach with separate global modality and local ensemble models to accommodate missing modalities and enhance personalization

- Joint modality and client selection strategy to significantly reduce communication overhead while maintaining accuracy

- Experiments on 5 real-world multimodal datasets demonstrating over 20x communication savings with comparable accuracy to baselines

- Analysis of modality impact using Shapley values to reveal interactions and changing importance of modalities during federated learning process

The key insight is that not all modalities need to be communicated each round, and selective participation can optimize tradeoff between communication efficiency and model performance. The joint selection and bifurcated modeling enable communicating only the most valuable information for the global model while allowing personalized deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multimodal federated learning framework called mmFedMC that uses joint modality and client selection strategies to reduce communication overhead while maintaining model performance across heterogeneous edge devices with diverse sensors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a multimodal federated learning (mmFL) framework called mmFedMC that performs joint modality and client selection to reduce communication overhead while maintaining model performance. 

2. For modality selection, it introduces metrics like Shapley value to quantify impact, model size to estimate communication cost, and recency to track upload history. This allows clients to selectively choose which modality models to upload based on these factors.

3. For client selection, it ranks clients based on the local loss of their modality models to pick clients that have a bigger impact on learning efficiency. 

4. It conducts experiments on 5 real-world multimodal datasets from domains like wearable sensors, healthcare, language, and satellite imagery. Results show mmFedMC achieves comparable accuracy to baselines while reducing communication overhead by over 20x.

5. It provides detailed analytics on the impact of different modalities in the federated learning process using Shapley values. This gives insights into the interplay and dynamics between modalities.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed mmFedMC framework that employs joint modality and client selection strategies to significantly enhance communication efficiency in multimodal federated learning settings while maintaining accuracy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a joint modality and client selection strategy to improve communication efficiency in multimodal federated learning. What are the key factors considered in modality selection and how are they quantified?

2. The concept of "recency" is introduced in modality selection to prevent overemphasis on certain modalities. What is the rationale behind using recency and how is it calculated? 

3. The paper argues that client selection based on lower local loss performs better than higher local loss. What could be some reasons why lower local loss clients are better, especially in cases where the loss function exhibits multiple local minima?

4. Shapley values are used to quantify the impact of each modality on the prediction. How are these values calculated and what insights do they provide about modality importance during the federated learning process?

5. The decision-level fusion approach retains a personalized ensemble model locally on each client. What are some advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to traditional end-to-end fusion models in multimodal FL?

6. How does the proposed framework handle heterogeneous clients that may have different sets of available modalities? What strategies allow it to function properly even with missing modalities?  

7. The experiments show interesting dynamics in modality selection over the course of training. What factors drive the shifting preferences between modalities like eye tracking and body tracking in the ActionSense dataset experiments?

8. What are some key differences in how the framework performs using the ActionSense dataset versus the UCI-HAR dataset? How do properties of the datasets affect modality selection?

9. The client sample size and degree of class imbalance can significantly impact local loss and client selection. How might extreme imbalance or overfitting scenarios be handled to prevent biased selection?

10. What future work directions are discussed to further improve the adaptability of the framework, such as through dynamic weighting of selection criteria at different stages of training?
