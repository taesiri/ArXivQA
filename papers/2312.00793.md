# [Variants of Tagged Sentential Decision Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Boolean functions are widely used in computer science fields like computer-aided design, cryptography and formal methods. Compact representations of Boolean functions enable efficient manipulation and analysis. 
- Two well-known compact forms are sentential decision diagrams (SDDs) and zero-suppressed SDDs (ZSDDs). SDDs minimize size using standard reduction rules while ZSDDs use zero-suppressed rules to achieve more compactness for sparse functions.
- Neither SDDs nor ZSDDs dominate across all Boolean functions. Integrating both types of reduction rules can provide more succinct representations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes tagged SDDs (TSDDs) that allow both standard and zero-suppressed reduction rules. It presents four variants of TSDDs based on:
  1) Order of applying rules: standard-first (STSDDs) or zero-suppressed-first (ZTSDDs)
  2) Implementation: node-based or edge-based
- STSDDs apply standard rules first then zero-suppressed rules. ZTSDDs use the opposite order. 
- In node-based TSDDs, each node stores both primary and secondary vtrees. In edge-based TSDDs, primary vtrees are stored on edges.
- The paper gives syntax, semantics, canonicity proofs and algorithms for binary operations on TSDDs.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposal of STSDDs and ZTSDDs as variants of TSDDs using different rule application orders
- Node-based and edge-based implementations of TSDDs leading to four TSDD variants 
- Formalization of syntax, semantics and canonicity results for STSDDs
- Algorithms and implementations for binary operations on STSDDs
- Experimental evaluation showing TSDD variants can be significantly more compact than SDDs or ZSDDs
