# [Adversarial Infrared Geometry: Using Geometry to Perform Adversarial   Attack against Infrared Pedestrian Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Infrared pedestrian detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing infrared physical attacks have limitations like lack of stealthiness, inefficient optimization, and limited perturbation modes (only black and white).  
- Key challenges are: (1) Limited perturbation modes in infrared attacks constrain attack diversity and granularity; (2) Efficiently optimizing perturbations within these modes is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Adversarial Infrared Geometry (AdvIG) - an efficient black-box infrared physical attack using basic geometric shapes (lines, triangles, ellipses) as perturbations. 
- AdvIG uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize parameters of these shapes to identify the most adversarial patterns. 
- In the physical world, optimized geometric patterns are created using cold patches affixed inside pedestrian's clothing to attack infrared pedestrian detectors.

Main Contributions:
- AdvIG is simple, efficient, stealthy and robust for infrared black-box attacks with total cost <$5.
- Extensive experiments evaluate effectiveness, stealthiness and robustness of AdvIG.
- Digital attacks achieve 86-100% success rates with <150 queries using lines, triangles and ellipses.
- Physical attacks achieve 50-96% success rates against infrared pedestrian detector.
- AdvIG outperforms baseline HCB method in both digital and physical environments.  
- Comprehensive analysis of AdvIG is done including ablation studies, transfer attacks and defense strategies.
- Findings showcase AdvIG's capabilities and emphasize internal perturbation placement for enhanced stealthiness in future infrared attacks.

In summary, the paper proposes a practical and effective infrared physical attack method AdvIG using basic geometries and validates its performance through comprehensive experiments. Key findings advocate increased attention to AdvIG and provide directions for future infrared attack research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes AdvIG, an efficient black-box infrared physical attack method that uses basic geometric shapes optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization to attack infrared pedestrian detectors with high effectiveness, stealthiness and robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces Adversarial Infrared Geometry (AdvIG), a cost-effective and practical black-box infrared adversarial attack method. AdvIG is distinguished by its stealthiness, efficiency, and affordability, with a total cost of less than $5. Its capability to perform black-box adversarial attacks further enhances its practicality.

2. It conducts extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of AdvIG. Results demonstrate that AdvIG achieves attack success rates exceeding 85% and 50% using lines, triangles, and ellipses in both digital and physical environments, affirming its effectiveness. Regarding stealthiness, the method strategically deploys perturbations inside pedestrian clothing, rendering them imperceptible to human observers without infrared sensors, while maintaining perturbation levels below baseline, confirming its stealthiness. Moreover, robustness tests reveal high attack success rates against various advanced infrared object detectors, validating its robustness.

3. It conducts a series of comprehensive experiments to thoroughly analyze AdvIG, encompassing ablation experiments, digital/physical transfer attack experiments, and adversarial defense experiments, among others. These experiments provide valuable insights into the performance of AdvIG. Additionally, it anticipates future research directions in the field of infrared physical attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and experimentally validating AdvIG as a simple, efficient, stealthy and robust black-box adversarial attack method for infrared pedestrian detectors.
