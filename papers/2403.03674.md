# [Adversarial Infrared Geometry: Using Geometry to Perform Adversarial   Attack against Infrared Pedestrian Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Infrared pedestrian detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing infrared physical attacks have limitations like lack of stealthiness, inefficient optimization, and limited perturbation modes (only black and white).  
- Key challenges are: (1) Limited perturbation modes in infrared attacks constrain attack diversity and granularity; (2) Efficiently optimizing perturbations within these modes is difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Adversarial Infrared Geometry (AdvIG) - an efficient black-box infrared physical attack using basic geometric shapes (lines, triangles, ellipses) as perturbations. 
- AdvIG uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize parameters of these shapes to identify the most adversarial patterns. 
- In the physical world, optimized geometric patterns are created using cold patches affixed inside pedestrian's clothing to attack infrared pedestrian detectors.

Main Contributions:
- AdvIG is simple, efficient, stealthy and robust for infrared black-box attacks with total cost <$5.
- Extensive experiments evaluate effectiveness, stealthiness and robustness of AdvIG.
- Digital attacks achieve 86-100% success rates with <150 queries using lines, triangles and ellipses.
- Physical attacks achieve 50-96% success rates against infrared pedestrian detector.
- AdvIG outperforms baseline HCB method in both digital and physical environments.  
- Comprehensive analysis of AdvIG is done including ablation studies, transfer attacks and defense strategies.
- Findings showcase AdvIG's capabilities and emphasize internal perturbation placement for enhanced stealthiness in future infrared attacks.

In summary, the paper proposes a practical and effective infrared physical attack method AdvIG using basic geometries and validates its performance through comprehensive experiments. Key findings advocate increased attention to AdvIG and provide directions for future infrared attack research.
