# [Funneled Bayesian Optimization for Design, Tuning and Control of   Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Many problems in autonomous systems and robotics, such as algorithm tuning, automatic control, and intelligent design, can be formulated as expensive global optimization problems where the objective function evaluations are costly. These problems often exhibit nonstationary behavior, where the local shape of the function near the optimum is different from the global shape. Standard Bayesian optimization methods assume a stationary Gaussian process surrogate model, which limits their efficiency and applicability in these problems.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new Bayesian optimization method called Spartan Bayesian Optimization (SBO) which uses a novel nonstationary kernel that combines a global kernel and multiple local kernels with moving centers. This allows adaptive modeling of nonstationarity focused around the local optima. Specifically, the local kernels create a "funnel" structure centered on the region of high sample density, which typically corresponds to the location of the minima. The funnel structure also enables improved local exploitation without compromising global exploration.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of the Spartan kernel that enables nonstationary modeling through a combination of global and local kernels focused adaptively around the optima
- Significantly improved performance over standard BO and state-of-the-art nonstationary BO methods in various problems: optimization benchmarks, machine learning hyperparameter tuning, reinforcement learning control problems, and wing design
- Demonstration of the sample efficiency of SBO in complex real problems like computational fluid dynamics based automated wing design
- Analysis showing that the method can also improve performance in stationary problems through better local refinement
- Extensive experimental validation highlighting wide applicability in autonomous systems and robotics

In summary, the paper presents Spartan Bayesian Optimization, a novel nonstationary Bayesian optimization technique using a specialized kernel, that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in efficiency, modeling capability and applicability to real autonomous systems problems.
