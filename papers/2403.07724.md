# [Balancing Fairness and Accuracy in Data-Restricted Binary Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning models are increasingly being used to make decisions in high-stakes applications like lending, hiring, and criminal justice. However, several studies have found these models to be biased against certain demographic groups. To address this, various mathematical definitions of fairness have been proposed, including group fairness notions like demographic parity and equalized odds, and individual fairness notions. However, it has been shown that exactly satisfying multiple fairness definitions simultaneously may be impossible. This raises a couple of key questions - (1) To what extent can multiple fairness notions be satisfied, (2) What is the impact on the accuracy of a model when trying to satisfy multiple fairness constraints? Answering these questions requires analyzing the behavior of the optimal Bayesian classifier on the true underlying data distribution when it is forced to satisfy fairness constraints. However, in practice we only have access to samples from the true distribution, not the actual distribution itself.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a framework to approximate the true underlying distribution from samples and analyze the accuracy vs. fairness tradeoff for a Bayesian classifier on this distribution. The key ideas are:

1. Use a generative model to densely sample the distribution and apply vector quantization to construct a discrete approximation.

2. Formulate a convex optimization problem to analyze the decisions of a fair Bayesian classifier on this discrete distribution under constraints encoding individual and group fairness notions.

3. Solve the optimization problem to quantify the reduction in accuracy when forcing the Bayesian classifier to satisfy different combinations of individual and group fairness constraints.

4. Analyze this tradeoff under 4 practical scenarios regarding availability of sensitive attributes and requirements around decorrelating features from sensitive attributes.

Main Contributions:

1. A method to faithfully construct a discrete approximation of the true underlying distribution from samples using a generator model and vector quantization.

2. Convex optimization formulations to directly encode multiple individual and group fairness constraints and analyze accuracy vs. fairness tradeoffs for optimal Bayesian classifier.

3. Extensive experiments quantifying these tradeoffs on 3 datasets under 4 practical data availability scenarios, providing insights into compatibility of different fairness definitions.

4. Analysis and visualization tools to understand tensions among different fairness notions and their dependence on the underlying feature distribution.

The framework provides an analysis toolkit to help developers of fair ML models determine the right constraints to impose based on their application requirements and data availability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to analyze the trade-off between accuracy and fairness under various practical scenarios that restrict the data available to a classifier, using vector quantization and convex optimization techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a framework that can be used as a tool to analyze the underlying feature distribution of a dataset and determine the compatibility of different fairness notions in performing classification.

2) It introduces a method for constructing a high quality discrete approximation of the underlying feature distribution of a dataset using a generator and vector quantization. 

3) It constructs multiple convex optimization problems to analyze the trade-off between accuracy and individual and group fairness notions under four practical data restricting scenarios - specifically when the sensitive attribute is/isn't available and when the features are/aren't required to be decorrelated from the sensitive attribute.

4) It presents experimental results on three benchmark datasets to analyze the framework and quantify the tensions among different fairness notions and their distributional dependencies.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed framework and associated optimization formulations to enable a quantitative analysis of the accuracy-fairness tradeoff under different practical constraints regarding availability of sensitive attributes and correlations between features and sensitive attributes. The experiments then demonstrate the utility of this analysis framework.

The paper proposes a framework to analyze the trade-off between fairness and accuracy of machine learning models under different practical scenarios that restrict the data available for analysis. It utilizes techniques like vector quantization, linear programming, and convex optimization to construct optimization problems that model a Bayesian classifier's decisions when constrained to satisfy individual and group fairness notions like demographic parity, equal opportunity, equal accuracy etc. The analysis is performed under four data restricting situations regarding availability and decorrelation of sensitive attributes. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the utility of the framework.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes approximating the underlying population distribution of a dataset by using a generator model to densely sample the distribution and then applying vector quantization. What are the key benefits of this approach compared to trying to directly model the distribution from the original dataset? What are some of the potential limitations?

2) The paper formulates the accuracy-fairness trade-off analysis as a convex optimization problem that aims to find an optimal deviation from an unconstrained Bayesian classifier's scores to produce a fair classifier. Why is formulating the problem in this way beneficial compared to more standard regularization-based approaches to fairness?

3) The method enables analysis under four different data-restricting scenarios (aware/unaware of sensitive attribute, features decorrelated/not decorrelated from sensitive attribute). What is the intuition behind why the accuracy-fairness trade-offs can differ significantly between these scenarios? 

4) How does the choice of distance metric used in enforcing individual fairness constraints impact the overall accuracy-fairness trade-off analysis? What are some good strategies for setting the neighborhood size hyperparameter?

5) The experiments analyze trade-offs between various pairs and triplets of fairness constraints. What trends do you observe in terms of which constraints seem more inherently compatible or in conflict? How does this depend on the dataset?

6) Why is transferring fairness to a decorrelated feature space an important practical consideration? What optimization approach is used for learning the decorrelating mappings and how does it balance competing objectives?

7) From analyzing the visualizations in Fig 4 in the paper, what seems to cause individual fairness to clash with notions of group fairness when the sensitive attribute is unavailable? 

8) What are the computational bottlenecks in the overall pipeline? Could the method be sped up through better optimization procedures, approximations, or hardware like GPUs/TPUs?

9) How well do you think this method would extend to handling non-binary sensitive attributes or continuous score outputs instead of binary classification? What modifications would need to be made?

10) If you had access to this framework/toolkit, what types of additional experiments or analysis would you be interested in trying with real-world datasets? What other extensions or improvements could make it more useful?
