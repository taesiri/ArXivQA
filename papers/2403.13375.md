# [Few-shot Oriented Object Detection with Memorable Contrastive Learning   in Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13375)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses two key challenges in few-shot object detection (FSOD) for remote sensing images:
1) Existing FSOD methods use axis-aligned bounding boxes which can result in misalignment for arbitrarily oriented objects common in aerial images. 
2) The scarcity of annotated data limits model performance, especially for novel/unseen categories.

Proposed Solution:
To address these issues, the paper proposes a new FSOD method called Few-shot Oriented object detection with Memorable Contrastive learning (FOMC):

1) It introduces a new task - few-shot oriented object detection (FSOOD) which focuses on predicting oriented bounding boxes for novel categories using just a few annotated examples. This provides better alignment and localization.

2) A Memorable Contrastive Learning (MCL) module is proposed to enhance the model's ability to extract distinctive features using a memory bank and contrastive loss. This captures intra-class compactness and inter-class differences using more negative samples across mini-batches.

3) A shot masking technique is introduced to mitigate label confusion from unselected objects in partially annotated images.

Main Contributions:

1) Introduces the new FSOOD task for oriented object detection in aerial images using limited annotations.

2) Proposes an MCL module to learn discriminative embeddings using contrastive learning with a memory bank covering more negatives.

3) Develops a shot masking strategy to reduce label confusion in few-shot fine-tuning.

4) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSOOD using DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets, demonstrating the ability to effectively detect oriented objects in aerial images using just a few annotated examples.

In summary, the paper pioneers the few-shot oriented object detection task and proposes innovative solutions to address key data scarcity and orientation challenges for detecting arbitrary aerial objects. The MCL and masking strategies boost model performance, outperforming existing few-shot detection techniques.
