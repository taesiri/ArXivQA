# [Locally Attentional SDF Diffusion for Controllable 3D Shape Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04461)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goals seem to be:1. To develop a novel 3D shape generation approach using diffusion models and SDF representation that can produce high-quality and diverse shapes. 2. To enable intuitive control over the 3D shape generation process through the use of 2D sketch images as conditional inputs. Specifically, to achieve better local controllability and generalizability compared to existing sketch-based 3D generation techniques.3. To validate the proposed "locally attentional SDF diffusion" (LAS-Diffusion) model on sketch-conditioned and category-conditioned 3D shape generation tasks. Demonstrate its advantages over other methods in terms of shape quality, diversity, controllability, and generalizability.The key hypotheses appear to be:- SDF representation and diffusion models are better suited for high-quality 3D shape generation compared to other representations like voxels or point clouds and generative techniques like GANs.- The proposed view-aware local attention mechanism can provide superior local controllability and generalizability for sketch-based conditional shape generation compared to using global sketch features.- The two-stage diffusion approach minimizing computational costs can enable high-resolution SDF generation.- The LAS-Diffusion model will outperform existing sketch-to-3D and 3D generative methods on various quantitative and qualitative metrics.In summary, the central goals are developing and validating a new controllable 3D shape generation approach using diffusion models, SDFs, and sketch-based local conditioning. The key hypotheses relate to the advantages of this proposed technique.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel diffusion-based 3D shape generation approach called Locally Attentional SDF Diffusion (LAS-Diffusion) that uses the SDF representation and a two-stage diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D shapes. 2. It introduces a view-aware local attention mechanism that utilizes 2D image patch features to guide the 3D diffusion model in a cross-attention manner. This provides better local controllability and generalizability for sketch-conditioned shape generation.3. It demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach over existing works in sketch-conditioned shape generation, in terms of controllability, generalizability, and reconstruction quality.4. It shows the capability of LAS-Diffusion in generating high-quality and diverse shapes for category-conditioned generation, outperforming other 3D generative models.5. It validates various nice properties of LAS-Diffusion, including robustness to view changes, capability to generate shapes with unseen structures, and potential to manipulate shape generation via ViT feature editing.In summary, the key novelty lies in the design of the two-stage SDF diffusion model empowered by the view-aware local attention mechanism for better quality, controllability and generalizability in 3D shape generation. The extensive experiments and comparisons validate the advantages of the proposed approach.
