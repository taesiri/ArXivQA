# [Locally Attentional SDF Diffusion for Controllable 3D Shape Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04461)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goals seem to be:1. To develop a novel 3D shape generation approach using diffusion models and SDF representation that can produce high-quality and diverse shapes. 2. To enable intuitive control over the 3D shape generation process through the use of 2D sketch images as conditional inputs. Specifically, to achieve better local controllability and generalizability compared to existing sketch-based 3D generation techniques.3. To validate the proposed "locally attentional SDF diffusion" (LAS-Diffusion) model on sketch-conditioned and category-conditioned 3D shape generation tasks. Demonstrate its advantages over other methods in terms of shape quality, diversity, controllability, and generalizability.The key hypotheses appear to be:- SDF representation and diffusion models are better suited for high-quality 3D shape generation compared to other representations like voxels or point clouds and generative techniques like GANs.- The proposed view-aware local attention mechanism can provide superior local controllability and generalizability for sketch-based conditional shape generation compared to using global sketch features.- The two-stage diffusion approach minimizing computational costs can enable high-resolution SDF generation.- The LAS-Diffusion model will outperform existing sketch-to-3D and 3D generative methods on various quantitative and qualitative metrics.In summary, the central goals are developing and validating a new controllable 3D shape generation approach using diffusion models, SDFs, and sketch-based local conditioning. The key hypotheses relate to the advantages of this proposed technique.
