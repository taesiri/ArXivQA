## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Trustworthiness of AI models with metrics like fairness, robustness and accuracy is crucial for adoption in high-stakes applications. However, there are inherent tradeoffs between these metrics. Existing approaches impose algorithmic biases while trying to achieve these trustworthiness metrics. Hence, there is a need for a flexible data-centric framework that can provide user-controlled tradeoffs between the metrics.

Proposed Solution - VTruST:
The paper proposes a novel data-centric framework called VTruST that allows users to control tradeoffs between accuracy, fairness and robustness by selecting high-quality subsets from the training data. 

Key Ideas:
- Additive value functions are proposed for accuracy, fairness and robustness. These can be linearly combined into a single composite value function using user-defined weights.

- The problem of data valuation and subset selection is posed as an online sparse approximation problem which is solved efficiently using a novel online Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.

- At each epoch, the algorithm greedily replaces an existing selected datapoint with a new one if it improves the overall value of the selected subset.


Contributions:
- A flexible data-centric framework (VTruST) that allows user-controlled tradeoffs between accuracy, fairness and robustness

- Novel online OMP algorithm for efficient online sparse approximation 

- Empirical demonstration of Pareto optimal tradeoffs achieved by VTruST

- Analysis showing VTruST's selected subsets have desirable properties explaining the improved trustworthiness

Results:
Experiments on social, image and scientific datasets show that models trained on VTruST's selected subsets can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 10-20% on fairness, robustness and accuracy metrics. The analysis also demonstrates how VTruST is able to select fair, accurate and robust subsets from the data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes VTruST, a controllable value function-based framework for developing trustworthy AI models through online selection of high-quality and diverse training data subsets that allow tradeoffs between accuracy, fairness and robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a controllable value function-based framework called VTruST for developing trustworthy AI models using a data-centric paradigm. Specifically:

1) It allows users to specify a combination of trustworthiness metrics like accuracy, fairness, and robustness through a composite value function to guide the selection of high-quality training data subsets. The weights for the different metrics can be controlled to enable tradeoffs. 

2) It poses the data valuation and subset selection problem as an online sparse approximation problem and proposes a novel online orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm to efficiently solve it in an online manner during training.

3) Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on subsets selected by VTruST can outperform state-of-the-art baselines on accuracy, fairness and robustness metrics on several datasets. 

4) The data values generated by VTruST can also provide effective data-centric explanations behind the performance on different trustworthiness metrics.

In summary, the key contribution is a general, flexible and controllable data-centric framework for achieving user-controlled tradeoffs between accuracy, fairness and robustness for trustworthy AI.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an additive value function framework for accuracy, fairness and robustness. What is the intuition behind using an additive framework? What are the advantages and limitations of this additive assumption?
