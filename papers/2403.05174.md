# [VTruST: Controllable value function based subset selection for   Data-Centric Trustworthy AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05174)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Trustworthiness of AI models with metrics like fairness, robustness and accuracy is crucial for adoption in high-stakes applications. However, there are inherent tradeoffs between these metrics. Existing approaches impose algorithmic biases while trying to achieve these trustworthiness metrics. Hence, there is a need for a flexible data-centric framework that can provide user-controlled tradeoffs between the metrics.

Proposed Solution - VTruST:
The paper proposes a novel data-centric framework called VTruST that allows users to control tradeoffs between accuracy, fairness and robustness by selecting high-quality subsets from the training data. 

Key Ideas:
- Additive value functions are proposed for accuracy, fairness and robustness. These can be linearly combined into a single composite value function using user-defined weights.

- The problem of data valuation and subset selection is posed as an online sparse approximation problem which is solved efficiently using a novel online Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.

- At each epoch, the algorithm greedily replaces an existing selected datapoint with a new one if it improves the overall value of the selected subset.


Contributions:
- A flexible data-centric framework (VTruST) that allows user-controlled tradeoffs between accuracy, fairness and robustness

- Novel online OMP algorithm for efficient online sparse approximation 

- Empirical demonstration of Pareto optimal tradeoffs achieved by VTruST

- Analysis showing VTruST's selected subsets have desirable properties explaining the improved trustworthiness

Results:
Experiments on social, image and scientific datasets show that models trained on VTruST's selected subsets can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 10-20% on fairness, robustness and accuracy metrics. The analysis also demonstrates how VTruST is able to select fair, accurate and robust subsets from the data.
