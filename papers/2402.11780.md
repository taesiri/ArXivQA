# [Towards Joint Optimization for DNN Architecture and Configuration for   Compute-In-Memory Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11780)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures are promising to alleviate bandwidth bottlenecks in Von-Neumann architectures for large deep neural networks (DNNs). However, constructing optimal CiM hardware is challenging as the memory hierarchy configuration (cache sizes, bandwidths etc.) may not match well with a DNN's attributes. 

- Neural architecture search (NAS) has been effective in finding efficient DNN sub-networks for a target hardware metric budget. But it assumes fixed hardware configuration, often yielding sub-optimal sub-networks.

- There is a need for joint optimization of DNN architecture and CiM hardware configurations to create Pareto optimal options balancing accuracy and hardware metrics like latency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CiMNet, a framework to jointly search for optimal DNN sub-networks and CiM hardware configurations. It can comprehend the complex interplay between sub-network performance and choices like bandwidth, processing element size, memory size.

- It uses a multi-objective evolutionary search to evaluate accuracy and cycles for various sub-networks and hardware configurations, aided by predictors instead of real evaluations.

- The search space includes elastic parameters for both model (kernel size, width, depth etc.) and hardware (bandwidths, memory sizes etc.). Overall compute and memory capacity is kept constant.

Main Contributions:
- Novel joint optimization paradigm and framework for co-design of near optimal DNN algorithms and hardware without frozen hardware assumption.

- Infrastructure for DNN compiler and accurate simulator to project end-to-end latency for any hardware configuration and sub-network.

- Experiments show joint search can yield 5.4x fewer cycles for similar ImageNet accuracy compared to 2.1x reduction with only model architecture search.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in enabling joint search over elastic DNN architectures and hardware configurations to achieve synergistic and optimized combinations for efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents CiMNet, a framework that jointly optimizes DNN architectures and compute-in-memory hardware configurations to create a Pareto frontier trading off accuracy and performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting CiMNet, a framework that jointly optimizes DNN architectures and hardware configurations for compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures. Specifically:

- CiMNet performs a joint search over model architecture parameters (e.g. kernel size, channel width, depth) as well as CiM hardware configuration parameters (e.g. bandwidth, memory size, number of processing elements) to find Pareto-optimal choices that provide good accuracy while requiring fewer cycles.

- Unlike prior work that assumes a fixed hardware configuration, CiMNet allows the hardware configuration to be optimized as part of the search. This allows it to find better solutions.

- CiMNet uses a predictor-based approach with a cycle-accurate simulator to estimate the accuracy and cycle counts of many architecture/configuration options. This avoids the need to actually evaluate all options, significantly speeding up the search.

- Experiments on CNNs and Transformers show CiMNet can find architecture/configuration pairs that provide similar accuracy to baseline models but require up to 5.4x fewer cycles. This demonstrates the value of jointly optimizing both architecture and hardware configuration.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Compute-in-memory (CiM) hardware: The paper focuses on specialized hardware that performs compute operations within the memory, alleviating bottlenecks in traditional von Neumann architectures.

- Neural architecture search (NAS): Method for automating the design of deep neural network architectures by searching over possible architectures. 

- Hardware-aware NAS: NAS techniques that take into account hardware constraints and metrics.

- Joint optimization: Simultaneous optimization of both the neural network architecture and the hardware configuration.

- Pareto-optimal: Networks and configurations that provide an optimal tradeoff between accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics like latency.  

- Predictors: Used to predict accuracy and hardware metrics like cycle counts, allowing much faster evaluation during architecture/configuration search.

- Elastic parameters: Aspects of the architecture and hardware that are variable during the search, like kernel sizes and memory bandwidth.

In summary, the key focus is on joint neural architecture and CiM hardware configuration search to find Pareto optimal solutions for efficiency and accuracy.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a joint optimization framework called CiMNet that searches for optimal sub-network architectures and hardware configurations. Can you elaborate on why jointly optimizing both the model architecture and hardware configuration is important rather than optimizing them separately? 

2. The paper categorizes NAS methods into iterative and one-shot approaches. Can you explain the key differences between these two categories especially in terms of training frequency and incorporation of hardware constraints? What are the limitations of existing approaches?

3. The paper leverages a predictor-based approach to estimate accuracy and cycles during the search process. Can you discuss why this was chosen over real evaluations? How does the use of predictors allow scaling to a large corpus of sub-networks?

4. Table 1 shows the different hardware configuration parameters that are considered elastic in the search framework. Can you explain why these specific parameters were chosen and how they impact performance? 

5. The paper proposes a bitline-free compute architecture for CiM hardware. How is this different from a bitline compute architecture? What are the advantages of choosing one over the other?  

6. The mapping strategy described in the Appendix converts a DNN layer into temporal and spatial dataflow tiles. Can you explain why determining optimal dataflow is important for efficient execution on CiM hardware?

7. What specific mechanisms allow the joint search space to change hardware configurations on the fly during the search process? How is this different from prior NAS techniques?

8. Can you analyze the Kendall rank correlation coefficients in Table 2 across different search spaces? What inferences can you draw about the relative difficulty of cycle count prediction?

9. Analyze the normalized hardware configuration parameters in Table 5 for the MobileNetV3 Pareto optimal points. How do these configurations change across the minimum, median and maximum cycle counts?

10. The paper demonstrates cycle count reductions up to 5.4x compared to baseline for joint optimization. Can you discuss what architectural choices contribute to these significant improvements?
