# [SeeGULL Multilingual: a Dataset of Geo-Culturally Situated Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05696)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative multilingual models are being rapidly deployed, but their safety and fairness evaluations are largely limited to English-only resources. This is problematic for evaluating socio-cultural phenomena like stereotyping, where cross-cultural perspectives are important.  
- Existing stereotype evaluation resources are limited to English or small non-English datasets. They fail to capture uniquely salient stereotypes in different languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper employs the SeeGULL methodology to build a large-scale multilingual stereotype dataset called SeeGULL Multilingual (SGM) covering 20 languages across 23 regions.
- It contains over 25,000 stereotypes about national and regional identities, with human annotations on whether each stereotype is considered offensive in that cultural context.

Key Contributions:
- SGM enables localized, cross-cultural evaluations of stereotyping behavior in generative models across languages.
- Analysis shows geo-cultural differences in stereotype perceptions even across regions sharing a language. 
- The dataset exposes gaps in existing model evaluations - models endorse different rates of stereotypes when evaluated with the broader set of multilingual stereotypes.
- Offensiveness analysis reveals differences in which groups have highly offensive stereotypes associated across languages and regions.

In summary, the paper introduces a methodology and dataset to capture multilingual, socially-situated stereotypes for better cross-cultural evaluation of AI systems. The analysis demonstrates the need to move beyond English and Western-centric resources.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SeeGULL Multilingual, a large-scale multilingual dataset of over 25,000 stereotypes spanning 20 languages and 23 regions, demonstrating its utility for identifying gaps in model evaluations across languages and cultures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of SeeGULL Multilingual (SGM), a large-scale multilingual dataset of over 25,000 social stereotypes spanning 20 languages and 23 regions. The key aspects of SGM are:

- It employs a methodology to couple large language model generations for scale with culturally situated human validations for reliability in building the dataset. 

- It has broad coverage across languages and regions to capture unique stereotypes salient in different cultures, going beyond just translating English stereotypes. 

- It contains annotations on the offensiveness of stereotypes based on geo-cultural perspectives.

- It enables multilingual evaluation of model stereotyping behavior and identification of gaps not apparent from English-only resources. The authors demonstrate this through an evaluation using SGM data.

So in summary, the main contribution is the creation of a novel, large-scale, multilingual dataset of stereotypes situated across languages and cultures to enable more comprehensive model evaluations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Stereotypes
- Multilingual dataset
- Geo-cultural situations
- Generative models
- Model evaluations
- Model safety
- Cross-cultural perspectives
- Offensiveness annotations
- Identity groups
- Nationality-based demonyms
- Regional demonyms

- Language models

The paper introduces a new multilingual dataset called "SeeGULL Multilingual" containing over 25,000 stereotypes spanning 20 languages and 23 regions. The goal is to enable more comprehensive model evaluations, especially around safety and fairness, by capturing unique stereotypes salient in different languages and cultures. The dataset links stereotypes to nationality and regional identity groups and includes human annotations rating offensiveness. Overall, the key focus areas are around multilingual generative models, geo-culturally situated stereotypes, and using this new dataset to better evaluate model fairness and mitigate representational harms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper focuses on building multilingual stereotype resources. What were some of the key limitations or challenges in simply translating existing English stereotype resources to other languages that motivated the need for a new multilingual methodology?

2. The paper uses the SeeGULL methodology to build the multilingual stereotype dataset. Can you explain in detail the 3 main steps of this methodology - identifying identities, generating associations, and procuring situated validations? 

3. The paper collects stereotypes about both national and regional identities. What were some of the sources and techniques used to compile comprehensive lists of regional demonyms across the 20 languages?

4. When generating candidate stereotypical associations using LLMs, what prompted examples and few-shot demonstrations were provided to better orient the model? Can you suggest any ways to further improve this seeding?  

5. For situated human validation, what were some of the key annotation instructions and rating scales provided to annotators? What quality control steps were taken?

6. The multilingual dataset contains gendered demonyms leading to gendered stereotypes. Can you analyze some of the key differences noticed in attributes associated with masculine versus feminine demonyms?

7. The paper demonstrates differences in stereotype notions even for the same language used across different countries. What percent difference was noticed and why does this highlight the need for geo-cultural grounding?

8. When analyzing offensiveness of stereotypes, which country and language combinations were found to have most and least offensive associations? What were some of the highly offensive examples noted?

9. How was the multilingual dataset used to create an evaluation for testing model stereotype endorsements? What key differences were observed across models and languages during this evaluation?

10. What are some ways the multilingual stereotype resource can be further extended or utilized in future work around model evaluations or mitigations? What attendant ethical considerations need to be kept in mind?
