# [SeeGULL Multilingual: a Dataset of Geo-Culturally Situated Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05696)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative multilingual models are being rapidly deployed, but their safety and fairness evaluations are largely limited to English-only resources. This is problematic for evaluating socio-cultural phenomena like stereotyping, where cross-cultural perspectives are important.  
- Existing stereotype evaluation resources are limited to English or small non-English datasets. They fail to capture uniquely salient stereotypes in different languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper employs the SeeGULL methodology to build a large-scale multilingual stereotype dataset called SeeGULL Multilingual (SGM) covering 20 languages across 23 regions.
- It contains over 25,000 stereotypes about national and regional identities, with human annotations on whether each stereotype is considered offensive in that cultural context.

Key Contributions:
- SGM enables localized, cross-cultural evaluations of stereotyping behavior in generative models across languages.
- Analysis shows geo-cultural differences in stereotype perceptions even across regions sharing a language. 
- The dataset exposes gaps in existing model evaluations - models endorse different rates of stereotypes when evaluated with the broader set of multilingual stereotypes.
- Offensiveness analysis reveals differences in which groups have highly offensive stereotypes associated across languages and regions.

In summary, the paper introduces a methodology and dataset to capture multilingual, socially-situated stereotypes for better cross-cultural evaluation of AI systems. The analysis demonstrates the need to move beyond English and Western-centric resources.
