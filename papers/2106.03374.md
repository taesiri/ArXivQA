# [RegMix: Data Mixing Augmentation for Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03374)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can data augmentation techniques be improved for regression tasks, where Mixup has limitations due to the continuous label space?The key hypothesis appears to be:Limiting the distances between examples that are mixed will lead to better model performance compared to standard Mixup techniques in regression tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes a method called RegMix that learns for each example how many nearest neighbors it should be mixed with in order to minimize the regression model's loss on a validation set. The underlying hypothesis is that mixing only nearby examples will produce better training data and model performance for regression compared to mixing more distant examples. Evaluating this hypothesis through experiments on both synthetic and real-world regression datasets is a main contribution of the paper.
