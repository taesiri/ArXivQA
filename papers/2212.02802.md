# [Diffusion Video Autoencoders: Toward Temporally Consistent Face Video   Editing via Disentangled Video Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02802)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to edit face attributes in videos while maintaining temporal consistency across frames. The key hypothesis is that decomposing videos into disentangled latent representations for identity and motion will enable consistent video editing by modifying only the identity feature.

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel framework called "Diffusion Video Autoencoders" to encode videos into a time-invariant identity feature and per-frame motion features. It hypothesizes that editing the identity feature and decoding it with the original motion features will result in temporally consistent video editing. The experiments aim to validate whether:

1) The proposed autoencoder can decompose videos into disentangled identity and motion latents.

2) Editing the identity latent leads to consistent video editing results. 

3) The diffusion autoencoder framework enables editing of real-world videos robustly, unlike GAN inversion methods.

4) The edited results are temporally more consistent compared to previous video editing methods.

In summary, the central hypothesis is consistent video editing via disentangled identity/motion representations, enabled by a novel diffusion autoencoder framework. The experiments aim to validate the decomposition, editing consistency, robustness and improvements over previous methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. They propose a novel video editing framework called Diffusion Video Autoencoders based on diffusion autoencoders. This allows decomposing a video into a time-invariant identity feature and time-variant per-frame features. 

2. Using the decomposed representation from the diffusion video autoencoder, they can perform face video editing by only editing the single time-invariant identity feature and decoding it with the original time-variant features. This allows temporally consistent editing.

3. Thanks to the near perfect reconstruction ability of diffusion models, their framework can handle editing of unusual cases like occluded faces, not just normal faces. 

4. They propose a text-based identity editing method based on CLIP guidance. This allows optimizing the identity feature based on a text prompt to get the desired editing effect. To make this more efficient, they propose using intermediate latent states rather than fully generated images for computing the CLIP loss.

In summary, the key ideas are leveraging diffusion autoencoders to decompose videos into identity and time-variant features, editing just the identity feature for consistency, using diffusion models for robustness to unusual cases, and CLIP-guided editing. The disentangled representation and editing only the identity are key for the improved consistency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel face video editing framework based on diffusion autoencoders that can decompose videos into disentangled identity and per-frame features, enabling temporally consistent manipulation by editing only the identity feature.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for temporally consistent video editing, especially for human face videos. Here are some key points on how it compares to prior work:

- Most prior work edit videos on a per-frame basis by manipulating the latent codes of each frame independently. This often results in temporal inconsistency across frames. In contrast, this paper proposes to decompose videos into time-invariant identity features and time-variant per-frame features. By editing only the identity feature, temporal consistency is maintained.

- Existing methods rely on pretrained StyleGAN for inversion and manipulation. However, GAN inversion is often imperfect, especially for unusual cases like occluded faces. This method utilizes diffusion models which have superior reconstruction ability, allowing it to handle even exceptional cases reliably. 

- For manipulation, this paper explores both predefined attribute editing by finding target directions, and novel text-based editing by optimizing the identity code. The text-based editing uses a new noisy CLIP loss between intermediate diffusion states, instead of estimated images, for efficiency and stability.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality, temporal consistency, and robustness to unusual cases. The method achieves realistic editing while outperforming baselines in quantitative metrics and user studies.

In summary, the key novelties are the diffusion video autoencoder framework for decomposed representation and consistent editing, superior reconstruction via diffusion models, and the new noisy CLIP loss idea. This enables temporally coherent video editing that handles even challenging cases, advancing the state-of-the-art in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest a few future research directions:

- Training the semantic encoders instead of using pretrained models. This could help discover more disentangled representations and expand the framework beyond face videos. 

- Finding ways to edit poses and facial expressions. Currently these are difficult to modify as they are not fully captured by the identity encoder. Developing methods to disentangle and edit these attributes could improve results.

- Enhancing disentanglement in the identity encoder's latent space. The pretrained identity encoder lacks some disentanglement which leads to entangled edits (e.g. gender bias). Exploring ways to disentangle this space more could improve controllability. 

- Applying the framework to higher resolution videos. The current setup is designed for 256x256 videos but could likely be extended to higher resolutions by incorporating diffusion upsampling modules.

- Generalizing the approach beyond face videos to other domains. The reliance on pretrained face models currently limits the framework to faces, but removing this could allow application to broader natural videos.

In summary, the main suggested directions are: 1) training the encoders rather than using pretrained models, 2) improving editing of poses and expressions, 3) disentangling the identity space more, 4) extending to higher resolutions, and 5) generalizing beyond face videos. The key goals are enhancing disentanglement, editability, and expanding the scope of the method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for temporally consistent face video editing using diffusion models. The key idea is to decompose face videos into a time-invariant identity feature and time-variant per-frame features like motion and background. This is achieved by proposing Diffusion Video Autoencoders, which encode videos into these disentangled representations. For editing, only the identity feature is modified, while the other features are kept fixed, allowing temporally consistent editing across frames with a single editing operation. Compared to previous GAN-based video editing methods, the diffusion modeling allows nearly perfect reconstruction and handling of edge cases like occlusions. The method is shown to achieve improved temporal consistency over previous approaches on tasks like adding eyeglasses or facial hair, while being robust on unusual videos. The editing can be performed using predefined attribute classifiers or optimizing the latent space using CLIP guidance. Overall, the disentangled diffusion video autoencoder provides an effective approach for high-fidelity and temporally consistent facial video editing.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Diffusion Video Autoencoders address the problem of temporally consistent editing of face videos. Previous video editing methods edit each frame independently using image manipulation techniques like GANs or diffusion models. However, this leads to temporal inconsistency across edited frames. 

The key idea of Diffusion Video Autoencoders is to decompose videos into a time-invariant identity feature, time-varying motion/facial expression features, and background features. The model consists of encoders to extract these features and a diffusion model to reconstruct the video from the features. For editing, only the identity feature is modified to change facial attributes, while keeping the motion features unchanged, leading to temporally consistent edits. Both predefined attribute manipulation using classifiers and text-guided editing with CLIP losses are explored. Experiments show the model can realistically reconstruct and edit videos, outperforming prior work in preserving identity and temporal consistency. Limitations include reliance on pretrained face recognition networks and difficulty handling edits like expressions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper proposes a novel face video editing framework called Diffusion Video Autoencoders, which is based on diffusion autoencoders (DiffAE). The key idea is to decompose a face video into a single time-invariant feature representing identity, and per-frame time-variant features capturing motion and background. 

Specifically, the identity feature is obtained using a pretrained ArcFace model and averaged across frames. The motion feature is extracted per-frame using a pretrained landmark detector. These features are encoded into a semantic latent code. The background is captured in a noise latent map. 

Given an input video, the model first encodes it into these disentangled latent representations. For editing, only the identity code is modified based on attribute classifiers or CLIP guidance. Then the edited identity feature, along with original motion and noise latents, are decoded to reconstruct the edited video. This allows modifying identity consistently across frames with a single editing operation.

Compared to GAN inversion methods, the diffusion autoencoder framework enables higher-fidelity reconstruction and editing of exceptional cases like occluded faces. Experiments demonstrate the model's ability to decompose videos appropriately and achieve temporally consistent manipulation superior to previous video editing techniques.
