# [Fighting Fake News: Image Splice Detection via Learned Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04096)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to detect image manipulations (specifically splices) without using any manipulated images for training. The key hypothesis is that images contain latent cues about the imaging pipeline that captured them, as encoded in EXIF metadata. By modeling the consistency of these cues, the method can detect when different parts of an image were captured by different imaging pipelines, suggesting manipulation.In particular, the main hypotheses are:- EXIF metadata provides a useful supervisory signal for training models to recognize consistencies/inconsistencies in how image regions were captured.- Modeling consistency of EXIF attributes and image patches enables detecting image splices and localizing the manipulated regions, despite never seeing actual splices during training.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling self-consistency, as captured in EXIF metadata, can allow detecting image manipulations in a completely self-supervised manner, without ever seeing examples of manipulated images.
