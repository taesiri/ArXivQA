# [Fighting Fake News: Image Splice Detection via Learned Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04096)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to detect image manipulations (specifically splices) without using any manipulated images for training. The key hypothesis is that images contain latent cues about the imaging pipeline that captured them, as encoded in EXIF metadata. By modeling the consistency of these cues, the method can detect when different parts of an image were captured by different imaging pipelines, suggesting manipulation.In particular, the main hypotheses are:- EXIF metadata provides a useful supervisory signal for training models to recognize consistencies/inconsistencies in how image regions were captured.- Modeling consistency of EXIF attributes and image patches enables detecting image splices and localizing the manipulated regions, despite never seeing actual splices during training.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling self-consistency, as captured in EXIF metadata, can allow detecting image manipulations in a completely self-supervised manner, without ever seeing examples of manipulated images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a self-supervised learning algorithm for detecting image manipulations (like splices) without using any labeled training data of manipulated images. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Using EXIF metadata as a supervisory signal to train a model to predict whether two image patches have consistent metadata, indicating they likely came from the same camera/imaging pipeline.- Applying this "self-consistency" model to image forensics by sampling many pairs of patches from a test image and measuring whether they are predicted to be self-consistent. Low consistency indicates potential manipulation.- Validating the approach by detecting and localizing image splices. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard forensics benchmarks, despite never seeing manipulated training images.So in summary, the core contribution is showing that photographic metadata can be used as free and plentiful supervisory signal to train models for image forensics in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled training data of manipulations. This helps overcome a key limitation of supervised learning methods for forensics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised learning algorithm for detecting image manipulations like splices by training only on real photographs and their EXIF metadata - it achieves state-of-the-art performance without seeing any manipulated images.
