# [Training Green AI Models Using Elite Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI model training is computationally expensive and has high environmental impact in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. 
- Prior work has shown promise for data-centric approaches to improve model efficiency, but the specific relationship between training data subsets and model performance is not well understood.  
- Identifying the most "elite" / representative training samples for a given model and dataset is an expensive optimization problem.

Proposed Solution:
- An evolutionary algorithm-based sampling framework to identify elite training samples tailored to dataset and model pairs. 
- Customizes differential evolution (DE) algorithm to solve the training set selection problem. Represents solutions as subsets of training indices to select elite samples.
- Objective is to maximize model accuracy while minimizing training set size.

Contributions:
- First framework to use DE for tailored elite sample selection to improve energy efficiency of AI training.  
- Empirical study across 8 ML models and 25 datasets to validate approach.
- Key findings:
   - With only 10% elite samples, model accuracy improved ~50% over baseline 70% training split.  
   - Energy savings up to 98% compared to normal training practice.
- Showcases viability of data-centric approaches to enable sustainable AI model training practices.
- Provides benchmark and insights to motivate further research into data's role in green AI.

In summary, the paper presents a novel evolutionary algorithm approach for identifying highly representative elite training samples for energy-efficient and accurate AI model training. The empirical study demonstrates significant promise to curb the environmental impact of AI systems.
