# [Disentangling the Causes of Plasticity Loss in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks can lose the ability to continue learning effectively over the course of training, referred to as plasticity loss. This causes problems in non-stationary settings like reinforcement learning.
- Prior work has proposed various explanations (e.g. dead units, parameter growth) but no single factor fully explains plasticity loss.
- There is a need for a better understanding of the causal mechanisms of plasticity loss and how mitigation strategies can be combined.

Key Contributions:
- The paper decomposes plasticity loss into independent mechanisms: regression target scale, smoothness of distribution shifts, preactivation distribution shifts, and parameter norm growth.
- It shows target scale and distribution shift smoothness directly impact plasticity in controlled experiments. Preactivation shifts cause unit linearization/death. Parameter growth impacts trainability.  
- Networks that lose plasticity exhibit similar pathologies - their empirical neural tangent kernels become ill-conditioned and low-rank.
- The paper evaluates interventions on each mechanism (e.g. normalization, regularization). Combining layer normalization and L2 regularization is highly effective at maintaining plasticity.
- Evaluation shows the combined intervention maintains plasticity on diverse synthetic/natural distribution shifts and reinforcement learning, demonstrating the promise of a "Swiss cheese model" where independent interventions are combined.

In summary, this paper provides novel analysis to decompose plasticity loss into causal mechanisms, identifies their manifestations, and shows that combining tailored interventions can effectively maintain neural network trainability over time.
