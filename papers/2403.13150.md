# [Training Survival Models using Scoring Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13150)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Survival analysis is used to model time-to-event data which is often censored. Most existing methods rely on likelihood-based optimization which can be computationally poorly conditioned and sensitive to outliers. 

- Scoring rules provide an alternative loss function to likelihoods for probabilistic predictions, but have mainly been used for model evaluation rather than training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a generic framework to train survival models by directly optimizing proper scoring rules as loss functions. This is more stable and robust than likelihood-based optimization.

- Two variants are presented: (1) Parametric learning to estimate distribution parameters (2) Nonparametric learning to directly estimate the survival function.

- The framework works with different model classes (parametric, semiparametric, nonparametric) and backends (neural networks, additive models etc.).

- For competing risks, separate cause-specific hazard models are learned.

Contributions:
- Show that parametric survival models can be recovered by optimizing scoring rules without needing the likelihood.

- Derive a nonparametric method to directly estimate the survival function based on proper scoring rules.

- Demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to other methods on several benchmark datasets.

- Establish a generic framework for survival analysis that allows flexible choice of model class and backend optimizer based on scoring rule loss functions.

In summary, the paper proposes a more stable and flexible way to train survival models using proper scoring rules that achieves excellent predictive performance across a range of settings.
