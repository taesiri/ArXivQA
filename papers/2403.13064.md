# [SceneScript: Reconstructing Scenes With An Autoregressive Structured   Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13064)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Finding an accurate and flexible representation for 3D scenes is an important challenge in computer vision and graphics. Traditional options like meshes, voxels, point clouds, etc all have limitations in terms of efficiency, accuracy or editability. This paper proposes using a structured text-based scene description language as an alternative representation.

Method (SceneScript): The paper introduces SceneScript, a method to directly predict a sequence of textual commands that describe the complete 3D layout and contents of a scene. The commands are part of a specifically designed structured language consisting of high-level parametric commands like "make_wall", "make_door", etc. Given an input video of a scene, SceneScript uses an encoder-decoder neural network to output this scene description language sequence which can then be interpreted to reconstruct the 3D scene.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a novel text-based scene representation using a structured language of parametric commands. This representation is very compact, interpretable, editable and extendable.
- Introduces SceneScript method to directly predict structured language scene descriptions from input videos using transformers. Demonstrates layout estimation and object detection results competitive with or better than recent specialized methods.
- Shows the flexibility of the representation by easily extending it to represent new scene elements like curved walls, object states, object primitives etc without changing the core method.
- Releases a large-scale synthetic indoor scene dataset called ASE with 100K scenes having trajectories, images, point clouds and complete ground truth scene descriptions.

In summary, this paper makes a case for structured text-based scene descriptions as an alternative representation compared to traditional geometric scene representations. The SceneScript method can effectively predict these flexible descriptions directly from visual data while also generalizing well to real scenes. The ease of extensibility to incorporate new scene elements is a major advantage demonstrated.
