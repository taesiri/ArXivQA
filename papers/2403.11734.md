# [Learning General Policies for Classical Planning Domains: Getting Beyond   C$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11734)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing GNN-based approaches for learning general policies for planning domains are limited to the expressive power of $C_2$ logic (first-order logic with two variables and counting). This limits their ability to learn policies requiring more complex logical features. 

- Going to higher order GNNs like 3-GNNs can overcome this limitation but has impractical computational requirements (quartic message passing time, cubic space for embeddings).

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a parameterized extended version of Relational GNNs (R-GNNs), called R-GNN[t], where t controls the number of recursive compositions of relations.

- R-GNN[t] takes a transformed set of atoms A_t(S) as input instead of just the atoms S. A_t(S) recursively composes relations up to t times using a new ternary predicate.

- For t>=1, R-GNN[t] can capture features requiring $C_3$ logic with only quadratic message passing and space complexity, approximating 3-GNNs practically.

- The architecture mirrors standard R-GNNs, with the transformation A_t(S) only affecting the inputs. So existing R-GNN code needs minimal changes.

Contributions:
- Introduce a practical way to enhance R-GNN expressive power beyond $C_2$ using the parameter t and automatic recursive composition of relations.

- Show experimentally that even small t values allow learning policies requiring $C_3$ features, with significantly improved coverage and plan quality compared to R-GNNs and Edge Transformers.

- Provide a detailed analysis attributing performance gains over baseline methods to the ability of R-GNN[t] to compute key logical features efficiently.

In summary, the paper makes R-GNNs more practically expressive using recursive relation composition, while keeping computational complexity quadratic. This lets them learn complex policies not possible with standard R-GNNs.
