# [On STPA for Distributed Development of Safe Autonomous Driving: An   Interview Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09509)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Domain:
- STPA is a safety analysis method recommended for developing complex automated driving systems. However, it lacks specific guidance for distributed and multi-level system development common in the automotive industry. 
- This causes issues in using STPA effectively across abstraction levels and between OEMs and suppliers, negatively impacting traceability and maintainability.

Methodology:
- Literature review of STPA guidelines to identify limitations relating to distributed, multi-level development.
- Interview study with 14 automotive safety experts to confirm challenges and evaluate proposed STPA adaptations.

Key Challenges Identified:
- Terminology differences between STPA and automotive standards causes confusion.  
- STPA lacks support for modular, multi-level architectures to enable distributed development.
- Suppliers can't identify hazards or model whole system, only their subsystem scope.
- No systematic traceability between STPA artifacts across abstraction levels.

Proposed STPA Adaptations:
- Tailored OEM-level STPA with automotive-aligned terminology and modular architecture. 
- Sub-STPA approach for suppliers focused on subsystem scope to enable traceability.
- Achieves traceability across multiple abstraction levels between OEM and supplier STPA.

Contributions:
- Identified and confirmed 5 challenges in using STPA for distributed, multi-level automotive development.
- Provided adapted OEM and subsystem supplier STPA methods to address limitations.
- Showed achievement of STPA traceability across multiple architecture levels.
- Proposed methods validated via automotive safety expert interviews.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary:

This paper proposes adaptations to the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) method to overcome challenges in applying it to distributed development of autonomous vehicles across multiple abstraction levels, and validates the proposals through an interview study with industry experts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Identifying five key challenges with applying STPA (System Theoretic Process Analysis) for safety analysis in the context of automotive systems engineering, particularly for autonomous driving functions. The challenges relate to mapping STPA to the automotive engineering process, lacking modular architecture, issues with hazard identification for subsystem suppliers, inability for suppliers to model the whole system, and lack of traceability between OEM and supplier analyses.

2. Proposing adaptations to "standard" STPA to address the identified challenges, both from an OEM perspective (tailoring terminology, incorporating modular architecture) and a supplier perspective (introducing a "Sub-STPA" method focusing only on the supplier's scope of supply). 

3. Validating the identified challenges and assessing the proposed STPA adaptations through an interview study with 14 automotive industry experts. 11 out of 14 experts recommended the proposed Sub-STPA as preferable for subsystem suppliers to use over standard STPA.

4. Demonstrating the achievement of traceability in the proposed multi-level STPA approach in Figure 5, enabling traceability from vehicle-level down to detailed technical requirements.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying limitations in applying STPA for automotive systems engineering, especially for autonomous driving functions, and proposing and validating adaptations to STPA to address these gaps to better suit the automotive context. The Sub-STPA enables subsystem traceability while protecting supplier IP.

The paper discusses challenges and adaptations for using STPA for safety analysis in the context of autonomous driving development across multiple abstraction levels and in a distributed development environment typical of the automotive industry. Key concepts revolve around making STPA more applicable for OEMs and suppliers working on different subsystems, enabling traceability across abstraction levels, and proposing an adapted sub-STPA approach for subsystem developers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an adapted version of STPA called "Sub-STPA" for use by subsystem suppliers. What are the key differences between standard STPA and Sub-STPA in terms of scope and process? 

2. One of the challenges identified is the lack of a modular architecture in standard STPA. How does the proposed Sub-STPA method address this challenge through its adapted process?

3. The paper mapped the STPA and Sub-STPA methods to relevant ISO 26262 and ISO 21448 activities. What is the benefit of this mapping in terms of traceability and practical application?

4. The proposed Sub-STPA method replaces Step 1 of standard STPA with a link to safety requirements from higher abstraction levels. Why is this an important adaptation to enable traceability for subsystem suppliers?  

5. In Sub-STPA, the control structure modeling only focuses on the subsystem itself, without other systems. What assumption does this require from the OEM's modeling process?

6. The paper validated the challenges and proposed method through an interview study. What measures were taken in the study design to prevent bias and influence on the experts' opinions?

7. The paper demonstrated traceability of STPA results across multiple abstraction levels. How does this traceability facilitate approaches like DevOps and maintainability?

8. Although focused on automotive safety, the paper suggests applicability of the method beyond this domain. What are some other potential industries or applications for the Sub-STPA approach?

9. The threats to validity section discusses several types of validity. Which one do you think is most important for this type of study and why?

10. To further validate the method, the paper suggests a detailed case study. What aspects would you focus on or measure in such a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of Sub-STPA?
