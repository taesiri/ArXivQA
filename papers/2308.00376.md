# [Deep Image Harmonization with Learnable Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00376)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve deep image harmonization models, especially for small-scale datasets, through learnable data augmentation. The key hypothesis is that generating additional synthetic training data through a learnable augmentation network can enrich the diversity and realism of small-scale image harmonization datasets, leading to improved performance of deep harmonization models.In particular, the paper proposes:- A novel augmentation network called SycoNet that can generate diverse, high-quality synthetic composite images from real images to augment small datasets.- An approach to integrate SycoNet with existing harmonization models to dynamically generate augmented data during training. - Experiments showing that the proposed learnable augmentation significantly improves harmonization, especially for small datasets like HFlickr and Hday2night where collecting more real training data is difficult.So in summary, the paper hypothesizes and demonstrates that learnable augmentation through a network like SycoNet can effectively increase the diversity of small harmonization datasets, leading to improved deep harmonization models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel learnable augmentation method for image harmonization, which dynamically generates additional synthetic composite images during training to enrich the illumination diversity of the training data. 2. It designs a synthetic composite network (SycoNet) to implement the proposed learnable augmentation. SycoNet takes in a real image and produces synthetic composite images by predicting suitable color transformations to adjust the foreground. It has a generation branch to transform the real foreground and a reconstruction branch to ensure the quality and diversity of the generated images.3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed learnable augmentation through experiments on multiple datasets. Using SycoNet to augment the training data leads to significant performance improvements, especially on small-scale datasets. 4. It provides extensive analyses and visualizations to understand how learnable augmentation helps image harmonization. It also compares dynamic and static augmentation strategies.In summary, this paper makes the first attempt at learnable augmentation for image harmonization and proposes a novel augmentation network SycoNet to enrich training data illumination diversity, which is shown to greatly enhance the performance of image harmonization models. The idea of using learnable models to augment training data could inspire more future research.
