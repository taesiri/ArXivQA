# [Deep Image Harmonization with Learnable Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00376)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve deep image harmonization models, especially for small-scale datasets, through learnable data augmentation. 

The key hypothesis is that generating additional synthetic training data through a learnable augmentation network can enrich the diversity and realism of small-scale image harmonization datasets, leading to improved performance of deep harmonization models.

In particular, the paper proposes:

- A novel augmentation network called SycoNet that can generate diverse, high-quality synthetic composite images from real images to augment small datasets.

- An approach to integrate SycoNet with existing harmonization models to dynamically generate augmented data during training. 

- Experiments showing that the proposed learnable augmentation significantly improves harmonization, especially for small datasets like HFlickr and Hday2night where collecting more real training data is difficult.

So in summary, the paper hypothesizes and demonstrates that learnable augmentation through a network like SycoNet can effectively increase the diversity of small harmonization datasets, leading to improved deep harmonization models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel learnable augmentation method for image harmonization, which dynamically generates additional synthetic composite images during training to enrich the illumination diversity of the training data. 

2. It designs a synthetic composite network (SycoNet) to implement the proposed learnable augmentation. SycoNet takes in a real image and produces synthetic composite images by predicting suitable color transformations to adjust the foreground. It has a generation branch to transform the real foreground and a reconstruction branch to ensure the quality and diversity of the generated images.

3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed learnable augmentation through experiments on multiple datasets. Using SycoNet to augment the training data leads to significant performance improvements, especially on small-scale datasets. 

4. It provides extensive analyses and visualizations to understand how learnable augmentation helps image harmonization. It also compares dynamic and static augmentation strategies.

In summary, this paper makes the first attempt at learnable augmentation for image harmonization and proposes a novel augmentation network SycoNet to enrich training data illumination diversity, which is shown to greatly enhance the performance of image harmonization models. The idea of using learnable models to augment training data could inspire more future research.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel learnable augmentation method called SycoNet to enrich the illumination diversity of image harmonization datasets by generating additional synthetic composite images, which helps improve the performance of image harmonization models especially on small datasets with limited training data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes an important contribution to the field of image harmonization by proposing a novel learnable augmentation method to enrich the illumination diversity of training data. Here is a comparison to other related works:

- Most prior works have focused on developing new network architectures or loss functions for image harmonization, but have not explored data augmentation strategies. This paper is the first to investigate learnable augmentation specifically for image harmonization. 

- A few works have tried simple augmentation like randomly applying color transforms, but as analyzed in the paper, these do not work well and can even hurt performance. The proposed SycoNet produces more realistic and diverse augmentations.

- For data augmentation in general, common techniques like flip, crop, cutout etc are non-learnable. Some works have explored learning augmentation policies, but they target overall accuracy rather than foreground/background alignment like in harmonization. 

- The proposed dynamic augmentation strategy is more effective than static augmentation with a fixed set of augmented images. The on-the-fly generation better matches the target distribution.

- Experiments show the benefit of augmentation is more pronounced for small datasets like HFlickr and Hday2night. The method is complementary to other improvements like network design.

- The idea of establishing a bijection between latent code and composite image is innovative. This ensures the quality and diversity of generated augmentations.

- The method can be integrated into any existing harmonization network with improved performance. Finetuning the augmentor on each dataset handles the domain gap well.

- Limitations are that performance gain diminishes for large datasets, and some hard cases with drastic illumination mismatch are still not handled well.

Overall, the paper makes a novel contribution by introducing learnable augmentation to the image harmonization task. The proposed techniques are shown to effectively improve performance especially for small datasets. It opens up a new research direction of designing tailored augmentation strategies for this problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving the performance on hard cases with extremely different foreground and background illumination statistics. The authors note that the current method sometimes struggles on these hard cases, which are rare in the training data. They suggest focusing more on generating hard cases during augmentation to improve the model's ability to handle them. 

- Exploring different forms of learnable augmentation beyond color transformation, such as geometric transformations. The current method only augments the color information, so expanding to other augmentation techniques could further improve diversity.

- Applying the idea of learnable augmentation to other image processing tasks besides harmonization. The authors show the benefits for harmonization, but the overall concept could potentially help other tasks too.

- Designing more advanced architectures for the augmentation network. The current network is relatively simple, so exploring different network designs could improve the augmentation quality and diversity further. 

- Evaluating the learned augmentation policy instead of just the end results. The paper focuses on evaluating harmonization accuracy, but analyzing the augmentation policy could provide more insights.

- Combining learnable augmentation with other harmonization techniques like attention mechanisms. The current approach is harmonization network agnostic, so integrating it with more complex harmonization networks could be beneficial.

- Exploring meta-learning to learn an augmentation policy that generalizes better across domains instead of domain-specific policies. This could improve the versatility when applying to new datasets.

Overall, the authors propose learnable augmentation as a promising new direction for data augmentation in image harmonization and suggest many interesting ways to build on this idea in future work. The concept could also inspire more research on learnable augmentation for other tasks.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel learnable augmentation method to enrich the illumination diversity of image harmonization datasets. Image harmonization aims to adjust the foreground of a composite image to make it compatible with the background. Existing datasets construct training pairs by generating synthetic composite images from real images. However, different datasets have large domain gaps. This paper introduces an augmentation network called SycoNet to produce more synthetic composite images for a real image. SycoNet contains a generation branch to transform the foreground and a reconstruction branch to ensure the quality and diversity of generated images. After training SycoNet, its generation branch can be integrated with any image harmonization network. During training, SycoNet generates extra synthetic composite images as augmented data besides original training pairs. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed learnable augmentation brings significant performance gain, especially on small-scale datasets.  

In more detail, this paper makes the following contributions:
1) It proposes learnable augmentation based on an augmentation network SycoNet to enrich illumination diversity for image harmonization training data. 
2) The SycoNet contains a generation branch to predict color transformation and adjust foreground, and a reconstruction branch to establish bijection between latent code and synthetic composite image.
3) Comprehensive experiments on four datasets prove that the proposed learnable augmentation can effectively improve performance of different image harmonization networks. Greater improvement is attained on small-scale datasets.
4) Analyses show that the proposed dynamic augmentation is better than static augmentation. Learnable augmentation can also enhance a unified harmonization model for all domains.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel idea of learnable augmentation to generate more training data for image harmonization. The proposed SycoNet demonstrates the effectiveness of learnable augmentation and can be easily integrated into existing image harmonization methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel learnable augmentation method to enrich the illumination diversity of image harmonization datasets. The key idea is to design an augmentation network called SycoNet that can generate multiple synthetic composite images for a given real image. SycoNet contains two branches - a generation branch that transforms the foreground of the real image to produce a synthetic composite image, and a reconstruction branch that ensures the quality and diversity of generated images. Specifically, the reconstruction branch establishes a bijection between a latent code and an original synthetic composite image, such that sampling the latent code can reconstruct the original composite image. This bijection enables generating diverse yet realistic synthetic composites by sampling random latent codes. Once trained, the generation branch of SycoNet can be integrated with any image harmonization network to dynamically generate augmented data during training. Experiments show that the proposed learnable augmentation significantly improves harmonization performance, especially for small datasets.
