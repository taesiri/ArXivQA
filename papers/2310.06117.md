# [Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06117)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can a simple prompting technique enable large language models (LLMs) to perform abstraction and derive high-level concepts and principles from instances with specific details? The authors propose "Step-Back Prompting" as a method to elicit reasoning via abstraction in LLMs. 

The key hypothesis seems to be:

By taking a "step back" and prompting the model to ask generic questions to extract high-level concepts and principles first, LLMs can better leverage their reasoning skills to solve complex reasoning tasks. This abstraction-based prompting technique will significantly improve the performance of LLMs on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning across domains like STEM, knowledge QA, and commonsense reasoning.

In summary, the central research question is how prompting abstraction can unlock stronger reasoning abilities in large language models. The hypothesis is that "Step-Back Prompting" enables LLMs to derive high-level abstractions that improve performance on complex reasoning tasks. The experiments across several reasoning domains aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is presenting a prompting technique called "Step-Back Prompting" that aims to improve reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Motivating the need for abstraction skills in LLMs to handle complex reasoning tasks involving many low-level details. Humans often use abstraction to derive high-level concepts and principles to guide reasoning.

- Proposing a simple two-step "Abstraction and Reasoning" scheme called Step-Back Prompting:
   - Step 1 Abstraction: Prompt the LLM to ask a generic "step-back question" to retrieve high-level concepts/principles 
   - Step 2 Reasoning: Use the concepts/principles from step 1 to guide reasoning towards the solution

- Demonstrating the efficacy of Step-Back Prompting across a diverse set of challenging reasoning tasks:
   - STEM reasoning (MMLU Physics and Chemistry)
   - Knowledge QA (TimeQA, SituatedQA) 
   - Multi-hop reasoning (MuSiQue, StrategyQA)

- Showing significant gains over baselines like chain-of-thought prompting, take-a-deep-breathe prompting, and retrieval augmentation. Step-Back improves performance of PaLM-2L by up to 27% on TimeQA.

- Providing ablation studies and error analysis indicating Step-Back Prompting makes abstraction easy to learn while reasoning is still the bottleneck.

Overall, the key contribution is presenting and empirically validating a simple yet effective technique to elicit reasoning via abstraction in LLMs, leading to substantial gains on diverse complex reasoning tasks. The results highlight the promise of using human-inspired techniques like abstraction to unlock the reasoning potential of LLMs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a method called Step-Back Prompting to improve reasoning and problem solving in large language models. The key idea is to first prompt the model to "take a step back" and derive high-level abstractions like concepts and principles relevant to the problem, and then reason about the solution grounded in those abstractions. This two-step "abstraction-and-reasoning" process reduces errors in intermediate reasoning steps and leads to significant performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks in domains like STEM, knowledge QA, and multi-hop reasoning. The one-sentence summary is: Step-Back Prompting enables large language models to solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively by first abstracting key concepts and principles before reasoning to the solution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of language model prompting:

1. The focus on abstraction is novel. Most prior work on prompting has focused on techniques like demonstrative prompting, verbalizer prompting, or chain-of-thought prompting. The idea of explicitly prompting the model to "take a step back" and abstract away details is a new approach that hasn't been extensively explored before. 

2. The simplicity of the approach stands out. Many recent prompting techniques involve complex prompt engineering or require finetuning the underlying model. By contrast, this technique only requires modifying the prompt with a few examples. The simplicity could make it more practical and adaptable.

3. The breadth of tasks evaluated is impressive. The authors test their technique on STEM reasoning, open-domain QA, and multi-hop reasoning datasets. Showing consistent gains across these diverse tasks strengthens the argument that abstraction prompting is widely applicable. In contrast, some prompting papers only show results on a single task or dataset.

4. There is a rigorous analysis and ablation study. The authors go beyond just reporting performance metrics by doing analysis of error categories, showing model robustness to different numbers of examples, and comparing against multiple strong baselines. This provides useful insight into when and why the technique works. Some related work has been less thorough in analyzing results.

5. Limitations around reasoning capabilities are acknowledged. The authors identify that flaws in reasoning and math are still a major source of errors, even when abstraction goes well. Openly discussing limitations prevents overclaiming and helps point to future work.

Overall, I would say this paper makes a nice contribution in a relatively novel direction for prompting research. Though the technique is simple, it is rigorously tested across diverse and challenging benchmarks. The analysis provides insight into the strengths and limitations of the approach. It advances the prompting literature and points towards interesting future work on abstraction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing new methods to generate more coherent and natural step-back questions. The authors point out that their current approach of using a few-shot prompt still sometimes results in step-back questions that are not optimally abstract or natural. New techniques could be developed to generate better step-back questions.

- Exploring different forms of abstraction beyond concepts and principles. The authors mainly demonstrate abstraction via retrieving concepts and principles in this work. Other forms of abstraction could be extracting analogies, high-level actions, causal relationships etc. 

- Better integration of retrieval into the prompting framework. The authors show that combining retrieval with step-back prompting is very effective for knowledge-intensive QA. More advanced ways of integrating retrieval context can be explored.

- Developing more advanced reasoning capabilities. The authors find reasoning is still a major bottleneck via error analysis. New methods to improve LLMs' reasoning skills need to be developed.

- Experimenting on a broader set of tasks. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of step-back prompting on STEM, QA and multi-hop reasoning. Testing on more complex reasoning tasks such as explanation, dialogue and strategy games is an important future direction.

- Studying how step-back prompting can generalize to unseen tasks. The prompting relies on a few demonstrations. Evaluating if the learned skills can transfer to new tasks with zero/few-shot examples is an open research question.

- Exploring limitations and potential failure modes. When step-back prompting fails or doesn't help needs more investigation. Identifying the failure modes can shed light on the limitations and help improve the method.

In summary, the authors point to several promising research avenues such as generating better abstractions, improving reasoning skills, testing on more tasks, and studying generalization and limitations as important future work building on step-back prompting.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Step-Back Prompting, a simple prompting technique to improve reasoning and abstraction capabilities in large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to first prompt the model to "step back" and ask a more generic, high-level question that requires deriving key concepts or principles. The model then leverages its reasoning skills, grounded in these abstractions, to answer the original question. Experiments across STEM, knowledge QA, and multi-hop reasoning tasks show Step-Back Prompting leads to significant gains over baselines in PaLM and GPT models. For instance, it improves performance by 7-11% on MMLU Physics/Chemistry, 27% on TimeQA, and 7% on MuSiQue compared to baseline prompting. Analysis shows Step-Back primarily fixes errors in the baseline models while introducing few new errors. The abstraction step is sample-efficient to learn while reasoning remains challenging. Overall, Step-Back Prompting provides a simple yet effective approach to elicit reasoning via abstraction in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here are two paragraphs summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper presents Step-Back Prompting, a method to improve reasoning and problem-solving in large language models through abstraction. The key idea is to first prompt the model to take a "step back" and derive high-level concepts or principles relevant to the problem. This abstraction provides a broader context to guide the reasoning process. The model is then prompted to solve the original problem using the abstracted concepts. 

The method is evaluated on challenging reasoning tasks in domains like science, fact-based QA, and multi-hop reasoning. Across diverse benchmarks, Step-Back Prompting is shown to significantly boost the performance of large models like PaLM and GPT-4. For instance, it improves accuracy by 11% on MMLU Chemistry and 27% on TimeQA over baseline prompting. The gains are attributed to more reliable reasoning grounded in abstract knowledge versus lower-level details. Analyses reveal the abstraction step is easily learned from few examples while reasoning still remains a bottleneck. Overall, the work demonstrates the promise of incorporating human-inspired techniques like abstraction into prompting design.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Step-Back Prompting, a method to improve reasoning and question answering in large language models through abstraction. 

The key ideas are:

1. Many challenging reasoning tasks contain low-level details that make it hard for LLMs to directly reason to the solution. 

2. Humans often take a step back, extract high-level concepts and principles, and use those to guide reasoning on the original task.

3. Step-Back Prompting teaches LLMs this skill through a two-step process:

- Abstraction Step: The LLM is prompted to ask a "step-back question" that retrieves high-level concepts/principles relevant to the original question. This is taught through few-shot examples.

- Reasoning Step: With the high-level knowledge, the LLM then reasons to the answer for the original question. This grounds the reasoning on conceptual knowledge rather than low-level details.

4. The method is evaluated on challenging STEM, knowledge QA, and multi-hop reasoning tasks. It substantially improves performance over baseline LLMs and other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought.

5. Analysis shows the abstraction step is easy for LLMs to learn while reasoning still remains a challenge, suggesting future work. But Step-Back Prompting significantly reduces reasoning errors by grounding it in conceptual knowledge.

In summary, Step-Back Prompting is a simple yet powerful technique to improve complex reasoning in LLMs by taking a step back and extracting high-level conceptual knowledge to guide the reasoning process. The empirical results demonstrate strong gains over existing methods on a range of challenging tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to enable large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks that involve abstraction and multi-step inference. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a technique called "Step-Back Prompting" that aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs like PaLM on challenging tasks in areas like science, fact-based QA, and multi-hop reasoning. 

The key ideas behind Step-Back Prompting are:

- Many reasoning tasks contain a lot of low-level details that make it hard for LLMs to focus on the core concepts/principles needed to solve them. 

- Humans often "step back" from the specifics and think more abstractly to identify the relevant concepts before reasoning to the solution.

- We can teach LLMs this "abstraction" skill using few-shot demonstrations.

- LLMs can then leverage their strong reasoning skills, grounded on the high-level abstractions, to more reliably solve complex reasoning tasks.

So in summary, the key problem is improving complex reasoning in LLMs, and the authors' proposed technique is Step-Back Prompting, which involves stepping back, doing abstraction, and then reasoning based on those high-level abstractions. The experiments across several challenging reasoning tasks show the promise of this technique.
