# [Real-IAD: A Real-World Multi-View Dataset for Benchmarking Versatile   Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing anomaly detection datasets are small-scale and limited, causing recent methods to saturate in performance (over 99% AUROC). This makes it hard to distinguish algorithm improvements.
- There is a gap between academic methods and practical applications. Most methods assume clean normal training data, but real industrial data contains anomalies.  
- Fully unsupervised anomaly detection is more practical but hard to evaluate due to limited anomalous samples in current datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Real-IAD, an industrial anomaly detection dataset with 150K high-res images over 30 object classes and 5 views per object. It has more challenging defects and annotation at the pixel, image and sample levels.

- Propose a Fully Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (FUIAD) setting that reflects real scenarios where less than 40% of training data can be anomalous.

Main Contributions:
- Real-IAD dataset that is 10x larger than existing ones with more diversity, scale and challenge. 

- FUIAD setting that requires no manual annotation, only uses the natural constraint of typical 60%+ manufacturing yield rates.

- Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art methods on Real-IAD under both standard unsupervised and proposed fully unsupervised settings.

- A highly challenging benchmark suite to push progress in industrial anomaly detection research.

In summary, the paper identfies limitations of existing anomaly detection datasets, contributes the large-scale and practical Real-IAD dataset, proposes the FUIAD setting more aligned with real application, and provides benchmark results to spur future research.
