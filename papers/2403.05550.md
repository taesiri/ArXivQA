# [Teranga Go!: Carpooling Collaborative Consumption Community with   multi-criteria hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set opinions to build   confidence and trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Innovative research often requires designing new questionnaires to collect data, but these questionnaires need to be validated. Common validation methods like the Delphi method are time-consuming and lose information by using only binary (accept/reject) assessments. 
- New pedagogical methodologies like flipped classroom (FC) and mobile learning (mL) also need tailored questionnaires to evaluate them, but it's hard to find pre-validated ones.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new method called the 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi (2TFLD) method to validate questionnaires. 
- It extends previous fuzzy Delphi methods to allow experts to use flexible linguistic term sets to assess each questionnaire item, better capturing their expertise levels. 
- Assessments on multiple criteria are aggregated via a Multi-Expert Multi-Criteria Linguistic Decision Making model to compute item scores, consensus indices, and reliance indices.

- They implement the method in an online tool to support moderators. The tool visualizes scores and metrics to identify problem items and modifications needed across Delphi iterations.

Key Contributions:
- A flexible linguistic Delphi method using 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic modeling to validate questionnaires, retaining more expert knowledge.
- Application in an education case study: validating a new questionnaire to evaluate a blended FC and mL learning experience. 
- The 2TFLD method computes multi-faceted measures (scores, consensus indices, reliance indices) to assist the iterative improvement process.
- An open online tool that implements their method's computations and visualizations to support moderators.

In summary, the paper presents an enhanced Delphi method for iteratively validating questionnaires using rich linguistic assessments from experts, demonstrating its use for a tailored questionnaire in educational technology research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The authors propose a 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method as an extension of the Fuzzy Delphi method to test the content validity of questionnaires using multi-granular linguistic term sets and expert judgements, and apply it to validate a questionnaire for evaluating a blended learning experience combining flipped classroom and mobile learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A new method called 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi (2TFLD) method to test the content validity of questionnaires by taking into account expert judgments with linguistic information and different expertise levels of the experts. 

2. A questionnaire specifically designed to measure satisfaction and communication for a blended learning experience combining flipped classroom and mobile learning methodologies.

3. Validation of the questionnaire for the blended learning experience through two rounds of the 2TFLD method with a panel of 9 expert judges.

4. An open source online tool to support the application of the 2TFLD method by visualizing results, simulating changes in parameters, providing filtering and search functions, etc.

In summary, the key contribution is the 2TFLD method and associated online tool to facilitate questionnaire validation using fuzzy linguistic modeling of expert opinions and consensus reaching. The method and tool are demonstrated on a real-world questionnaire for an educational blended learning experience.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi (2TFLD) method extend the capabilities of the traditional Fuzzy Delphi method? What specific improvements does it offer?

2. The paper argues that the 2TFLD method is more flexible than traditional approaches. In what key ways does it allow for more flexibility in the Delphi process and expert elicitations? 

3. What is the rationale behind allowing experts to choose linguistic term sets with different granularities? How does this fit into the overall goals of the 2TFLD method?

4. Explain the process of "unification" that allows linguistic assessments from different term sets to be transformed into a common representation. Why is this an important element of the 2TFLD framework?

5. How does the concept of "multi-granular linguistic term sets" allow the method to cope with scenarios where experts have differing degrees of confidence across questionnaire dimensions?

6. The computation of the consensus index CI incorporates expert weights per dimension. Why is reflecting expertise differences between dimensions an important consideration?  

7. Explain how the “satisfactory reliance level” epsilon allows flexibility in consensus requirements. How could this parameter be utilized in practice during a Delphi study?

8. Walk through how the trim functionality could be used by a moderator to assist in decision making regarding questionnaire length or construct validation.  

9. What are some ways the online DSS tool could be extended or built upon in future work? What limitations does the current version have?

10. How do the linguistic outputs of the 2TFLD method aid interpretability? Why is understandability an important concern for content validation procedures?
