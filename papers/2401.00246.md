# [Boosting Large Language Model for Speech Synthesis: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, but enhancing them with speech synthesis abilities remains relatively unexplored. 
- Most prior work has focused on aligning speech representations with the LLM input space to enable speech comprehension abilities. However, effectively augmenting LLMs to generate high-quality speech synthesis poses unique challenges.

Proposed Methods:
- The paper investigates 3 integration strategies to empower LLMs with speech synthesis capabilities using the state-of-the-art VALL-E text-to-speech model:
  1) Directly fine-tuning LLMs using paired text-speech data 
  2) Superimposing LLMs and VALL-E by using LLM to encode both text and speech tokens as input to VALL-E
  3) Coupling LLMs and VALL-E by using LLM as a powerful text encoder and feeding its output as input to VALL-E

Key Results: 
- Directly fine-tuning LLMs to predict speech tokens does not work well.  
- Superimposing LLMs and VALL-E improves over standalone VALL-E in speech quality and speaker similarity.
- The coupled model performs the best, significantly outperforming VALL-E baseline on word error rate (10.9% relative reduction), speaker similarity and speech naturalness.

Main Conclusions:
- Treating speech tokens as just another language to be modeled by LLMs is not effective. 
- While LLMs struggle to directly model speech, they can serve as excellent unified encoders of both text and speech.
- Using LLM solely as a text encoder and coupling it with a specialized speech decoder module like VALL-E gives the overall best performance.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive empirical study on integrating state-of-the-art LLMs and speech synthesis models
- Analysis of challenges in directly modeling speech using LLMs
- Demonstrating benefits of superimposed and coupled model architectures to empower LLMs with speech generation capabilities
