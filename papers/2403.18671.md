# [Fact Checking Beyond Training Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fact checking systems trained on labeled data from one domain often perform poorly when tested on another domain. This is an important but understudied problem.

- Large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 also struggle with verifying simple factual claims, showing the need for specialized fact checking systems.  

Methodology:
- The standard fact checking pipeline with a retriever component and a reader component was evaluated. Performance dropped substantially from in-domain to out-of-domain across both components.

- A new adversarial training method is proposed to make the retriever robust to domain shift. Separate document and claim encoders are trained to mimic outputs from the source domain encoder using unlabeled target data.

- The reader is trained to be invariant to input order using an alignment loss plus data augmentation with reversed claim-evidence pairs. This provides more supervision signals.

Contributions:
- A case study empirically demonstrating the domain shift problem in fact checking systems using real-world datasets.

- A novel adversarial domain adaptation algorithm for the retriever component in the pipeline.

- Exploiting the weakness of language models in detecting reversal relationships and using it to improve reader training.

- Evaluation across 8 domain shift scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance compared to using other domain adaptation techniques.

The key ideas are making the retriever and reader components more robust to domain shift individually through adversarial training and invariant training, leading to gains for the overall fact checking pipeline.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes novel algorithms to enhance the robustness of automated fact checking systems when trained on labeled data from one domain and tested on another domain, through adversarial training of the retriever component and representation alignment of the reader component.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an adversarial algorithm to make the retriever component of the fact checking pipeline more robust against distribution shift between domains. The key idea is to train separate claim and document encoders on unlabeled target data to mimic encodings from a model trained on labeled source data.

2. Exploiting the weakness of language models in detecting reversal relationships between claims and evidence, and proposing to train the reader component to be insensitive to the order of claims and evidence documents. This helps the reader extract more cues from the data. 

3. Constructing 8 fact checking scenarios from two datasets and comparing their full pipeline to strong baselines using domain adaptation techniques and GPT-4 for synthetic data generation. Their pipeline outperforms these methods in most cases.

In summary, the main contributions are methods to enhance the robustness and generalization of the common retriever-reader fact checking pipeline under domain shift, both through adversarial training of the retriever and making the reader order-invariant. The effectiveness of their overall pipeline is demonstrated through experiments on multiple domain shift scenarios.

The paper focuses on studying automatic fact checking under domain shift, where a fact checking system trained on data from one domain shows performance deterioration when tested on another domain. The key components studied are the retriever and reader modules in a standard fact checking pipeline. The paper proposes novel algorithms like adversarial training and representation alignment to make these components more robust to domain shift. Concepts like exploiting the reversal relationship between claims and evidence to train the reader as well as constructing multi-domain datasets are also notable ideas discussed in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an adversarial training algorithm for the retriever component to make it robust against distribution shift. Can you explain in detail how this adversarial training process works and what are the objective functions used to train the target encoders?

2. The paper exploits a weakness in language models' ability to detect reversal relationships between input statements. Can you elaborate on what this weakness is and why augmenting the reader's input data helps provide more cues? 

3. The paper uses correlation alignment as the alignment loss function when training the reader. What is correlation alignment and why is it suitable as an alignment loss in this context? How exactly does it help in reducing the discrepancy between source and target distributions?

4. The retriever uses a bi-encoder model based on dot product similarity. Explain what a bi-encoder model is, how dot product similarity works, and why this architecture was chosen for the retriever.

5. The paper proposes a ranking-based prediction at test time to combine the outputs of the reader and the rankings from the retriever. Explain this prediction formula and why taking a weighted average like this is beneficial.

6. What is domain shift and why does it cause a deterioration in performance when a fact checking pipeline trained on one domain is applied to another domain? Give some examples of domain shifts.

7. The paper extracts domains automatically from the MultiFC and Snopes datasets since they do not have predefined domains. Discuss this automatic domain extraction process and how the Google Content Classifier is used.

8. Compare and contrast the reader training method proposed in this paper versus common domain adaptation techniques like DAPT. What are the limitations of DAPT that this new method tries to address?  

9. The paper ablates the contribution of the different components of the pipeline. Summarize the main conclusions from these ablation studies and how each component contributes to the overall performance.

10. The paper adapts both the retriever and reader to the target domain, whereas some prior work has focused only on pretraining the full pipeline on the source domain. Why is explicitly adapting the components better for dealing with domain shift than just pretraining?
