# [Fact Checking Beyond Training Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fact checking systems trained on labeled data from one domain often perform poorly when tested on another domain. This is an important but understudied problem.

- Large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 also struggle with verifying simple factual claims, showing the need for specialized fact checking systems.  

Methodology:
- The standard fact checking pipeline with a retriever component and a reader component was evaluated. Performance dropped substantially from in-domain to out-of-domain across both components.

- A new adversarial training method is proposed to make the retriever robust to domain shift. Separate document and claim encoders are trained to mimic outputs from the source domain encoder using unlabeled target data.

- The reader is trained to be invariant to input order using an alignment loss plus data augmentation with reversed claim-evidence pairs. This provides more supervision signals.

Contributions:
- A case study empirically demonstrating the domain shift problem in fact checking systems using real-world datasets.

- A novel adversarial domain adaptation algorithm for the retriever component in the pipeline.

- Exploiting the weakness of language models in detecting reversal relationships and using it to improve reader training.

- Evaluation across 8 domain shift scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance compared to using other domain adaptation techniques.

The key ideas are making the retriever and reader components more robust to domain shift individually through adversarial training and invariant training, leading to gains for the overall fact checking pipeline.
