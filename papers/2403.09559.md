# [Less is More: Data Value Estimation for Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09559)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely on a mixture of diverse visual instruction datasets for training, which can introduce significant data redundancy and increased training costs. 
- There is a lack of methods to effectively estimate and reduce redundancy within the mixed visual instruction datasets used for MLLM tuning.

Proposed Solution - TIVE:  
- Conduct empirical studies on MLLM performance when reducing the amount of certain instruction types, revealing high redundancy and varying redundancy degrees across tasks.
- Propose a novel data selection approach "TIVE" based on task-level and instance-level value estimation using gradient information from the MLLM itself:
  - Task-level value: Compute average gradient norm for each task to measure its contribution.  
  - Instance-level value: Calculate similarity of instance's gradient to the task's average gradient to identify representative instances.
- Determine task proportions based on task values. Select instances using both task and instance values to construct a smaller yet high-quality instruction subset.

Main Contributions:
- First to investigate and address data redundancy issue for the mixture of visual instructions used in MLLMs. 
- Propose a gradient-based approach TIVE to estimate data value at both task and instance level for efficient redundancy elimination. 
- Experiments show using 7.5% selected data can achieve comparable performance as full fine-tuning, outperforming other selection methods.

In summary, the paper studies the redundancy problem in existing visual instruction datasets for MLLM tuning, and develops a novel data value estimation approach to effectively construct a smaller yet high-quality instruction subset for efficient tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel data selection approach called TIVE that efficiently eliminates redundancy from mixtures of visual instruction datasets by estimating the value of tasks and instances through gradient similarity, enabling comparable performance to full dataset tuning with only 7.5% of the data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel instruction data selection approach called TIVE (Task-level and Instance-level Value Estimation) to reduce redundancy in mixtures of visual instruction datasets used for fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs). 

Specifically, TIVE:

1) Estimates the task-level value and instance-level value of visual instructions based on computed gradients from key parameters of MLLMs. 

2) Determines the task proportion within the final selected subset based on task-level values to account for different contributions of each task.

3) Selects the most representative instances within each task based on instance-level values.

4) Constructs a smaller yet high-quality visual instruction subset by combining the selected instances across different tasks.

Experiments show that using only 7.5% of the full visual instruction data selected by TIVE can achieve comparable performance as fine-tuning on the complete dataset across 7 downstream benchmarks. The key novelty is selecting data for mixtures of visual instructions based on intrinsic properties of MLLMs.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed TIVE approach estimate the task-level value of different types of visual instructions? What key model parameters does it leverage to compute the gradient norms?

2. What is the intuition behind using the similarity between an instance's gradient vector and the average gradient vector to estimate the instance-level value? Why does higher similarity indicate more representative instances?  

3. The paper mentions balancing data proportions via data augmentation for extremely small tasks. What specific data augmentation strategy was utilized? How does it avoid changing the original data distribution?

4. What are the key differences between the proposed TIVE approach and traditional data selection methods like GradN and E2LN? Why do you think TIVE performs better?

5. The paper evaluates TIVE extensively on the LLaVA model. How well does it transfer to other MLLMs and diverse visual instruction datasets like Vision-Flan? What additional challenges emerge?

6. How sensitive is the performance of TIVE to the choice of hyperparameter Î» in the instance scoring function? What is the impact on data diversity and effectiveness? 

7. Could the proposed data value estimation approach be extended to other modalities like speech and video? What adaptations would be required?

8. How does the performance vary when applying TIVE iteratively to further reduce redundancy in the selected subset? Is there a performance plateau?

9. The paper focuses on data redundancy. Could TIVE be combined with methods handling other data quality issues like difficulty, diversity, and noise?  

10. What are other potential ways to estimate data value at scale for large MLLMs, apart from gradient similarity? How do they compare to TIVE?
