# [A Systematic Literature Review on Explainability for Machine/Deep   Learning-based Software Engineering Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14617)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, have shown great promise in automating various software engineering (SE) tasks. However, their lack of explainability poses risks for deployment in critical tasks where transparency is important. There is a need for techniques that can explain these black-box AI models. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of approaches for explainable AI (XAI) in the context of AI for SE (AI4SE). It collects 63 relevant papers published in top SE and AI venues over the past 12 years (2012-2023) and analyzes them to provide valuable insights into this emerging research area.

Main Contributions:

- Summarizes XAI techniques applied across 21 unique SE tasks spanning 4 key activities - software development, testing, maintenance and management.

- Classifies XAI techniques into 5 categories based on methodology - Interpretable Models, Feature Attribution, Attention Mechanism, Domain Knowledge and Example Subsets. Feature attribution approaches are most widely used.  

- Analyzes explanation formats provided, such as numeric, text, visualization, source code and rules. Source code is most commonly used format.

- Investigates evaluation approaches including baseline comparisons, benchmarks used and metrics employed. Notes lack of standardized baselines and benchmarks.

- Discusses key challenges for XAI4SE like lack of consensus on explainability, performance vs. explainability tradeoffs, lack of reusable benchmarks, and limited evaluation metrics. 

- Highlights promising future opportunities such as applying XAI to more SE tasks, developing customized techniques, incorporating human-in-the-loop interaction, and practical deployments.

Overall, the paper provides very useful insights into the current state of research on explainability for AI-based SE approaches, key challenges, and future opportunities. The SLR is quite comprehensive spanning a 12 year period and covering all major SE activities.
