# [Mirage: Cross-Embodiment Zero-Shot Policy Transfer with Cross-Painting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Transferring robotic manipulation policies across different robots is challenging due to differences in kinematics, controls, sensors, and morphology. Existing approaches require collecting new data and finetuning on the target robot. The paper investigates if it is feasible to achieve zero-shot policy transfer between different robot arms and grippers without any target robot data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Mirage, a novel cross-embodiment policy transfer algorithm. Mirage relies on two key ideas:

1) Cross-painting using robot URDFs and a renderer to address visual differences. It masks out the target robot from observations and inpaints the source robot at the same end effector pose. This makes it appear to the policy as if the source robot were performing the task.

2) Using end effector Cartesian space for state and action spaces. A fitted dynamics model converts source actions to target poses. A blocking controller on the target robot reaches desired poses, addressing control differences.

Main Contributions:
1) Simulation study analyzing feasibility of policy transfer between robot arms and grippers 

2) Mirage algorithm for zero-shot cross-embodiment policy transfer using cross-painting 

3) Extensive simulation and physical experiments with 6 robot setups on 9 tasks demonstrating Mirage can successfully transfer policies across different robots and grippers with minimal degradation, significantly outperforming baselines

The key insight is that for similar workspaces, quasi-static tasks can directly transfer between unseen robot arms by copying poses using state information. Mirage builds on this by handling visual differences with cross-painting and control differences with forward dynamics and blocking control. Despite its simplicity, results show Mirage enables successful zero-shot transfer without target robot data.
