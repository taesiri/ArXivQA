# [Paved2Paradise: Cost-Effective and Scalable LiDAR Simulation by   Factoring the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01117)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Obtaining large, diverse, and annotated 3D point cloud datasets is very costly and time-consuming, limiting progress in point cloud-based models like for object detection and segmentation. This is especially true for applications beyond autonomous driving where public lidar datasets don't exist.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose Paved2Paradise (P2P), a pipeline to generate synthetic lidar datasets from scratch with realistic variability and automatic annotations while minimizing manual labeling effort. 

- The key idea is to separately collect "background" scenes without target objects and "object" scenes with just the targets. These are intelligently combined to create realistic and diverse synthetic samples.

- P2P has 4 main steps:
  1) Passively collect diverse background scenes
  2) Record object instances performing various behaviors in isolation
  3) Bootstrap labels for object scenes 
  4) Generate synthetic samples by combining backgrounds and objects

- Various geometric transformations are applied to objects when placing them in backgrounds to ensure perspective consistency relative to the sensor location. Additional steps simulate occlusion and sensor effects.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated P2P's ability to generate a challenging synthetic orchard dataset for human detection, where models trained purely on this data successfully detect humans in real orchard scenes.

- Showed a P2P-trained model performs comparably to a model trained on real data for pedestrian detection on the KITTI dataset at the scene level, despite the real data model having advantages.

- Overall, showed that the P2P pipeline is a simple, cost-effective approach to generate large, diverse, realistic and automatically annotated lidar datasets from scratch for accelerating progress in lidar-based models.
