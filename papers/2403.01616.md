# [Towards Comprehensive Vietnamese Retrieval-Augmented Generation and   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need to advance Vietnamese language understanding and generation through the development of open datasets and pre-trained models for Vietnamese Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create and release several new open Vietnamese datasets, including:
  - A 53GB Vietnamese NewsCorpus dataset 
  - A Vietnamese NewsSapo dataset for training sentence/passage embeddings
  - A Vietnamese NewsCategory dataset for text classification
  - Vietnamese Alpaca datasets for fine-tuning LLMs 
  - Synthetic self-chat and roleplay realm datasets for conversation
- They also release new models, including:
  - A Vietnamese bi-encoder model for sentence embeddings
  - Vietnamese LLaMA2-7b models (40GB and 120GB versions) with further pretraining on Vietnamese text

Main Contributions:
- Massive 53GB Vietnamese NewsCorpus dataset
- Vietnamese NewsSapo and NewsCategory datasets
- Vietnamese Alpaca and conversational datasets
- Vietnamese bi-encoder model
- Vietnamese LLaMA2-7b models with 40GB and 120GB of further pretraining

The authors aim to advance Vietnamese language understanding and generation by releasing open datasets and pre-trained models. Their datasets, models and techniques allow the community to push forward innovations in Vietnamese NLP.
