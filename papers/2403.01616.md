# [Towards Comprehensive Vietnamese Retrieval-Augmented Generation and   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need to advance Vietnamese language understanding and generation through the development of open datasets and pre-trained models for Vietnamese Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create and release several new open Vietnamese datasets, including:
  - A 53GB Vietnamese NewsCorpus dataset 
  - A Vietnamese NewsSapo dataset for training sentence/passage embeddings
  - A Vietnamese NewsCategory dataset for text classification
  - Vietnamese Alpaca datasets for fine-tuning LLMs 
  - Synthetic self-chat and roleplay realm datasets for conversation
- They also release new models, including:
  - A Vietnamese bi-encoder model for sentence embeddings
  - Vietnamese LLaMA2-7b models (40GB and 120GB versions) with further pretraining on Vietnamese text

Main Contributions:
- Massive 53GB Vietnamese NewsCorpus dataset
- Vietnamese NewsSapo and NewsCategory datasets
- Vietnamese Alpaca and conversational datasets
- Vietnamese bi-encoder model
- Vietnamese LLaMA2-7b models with 40GB and 120GB of further pretraining

The authors aim to advance Vietnamese language understanding and generation by releasing open datasets and pre-trained models. Their datasets, models and techniques allow the community to push forward innovations in Vietnamese NLP.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents open datasets and pre-trained models developed by the authors to advance Vietnamese language understanding and generation through retrieval-augmented generation and large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A massive Vietnamese NewsCorpus dataset of around 32M articles, 53 GB in size, cleaned and formatted for continual pretraining of LLMs.

2. An extensive Vietnamese NewsSapo dataset in a "title-abstract-contents" format, designed to enhance training of sentence/passage embeddings. 

3. A Vietnamese NewsCategory dataset in a "text-category" format, designed for text classification tasks.

4. Vietnamese Alpaca datasets tailored for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs.

5. Synthetic self-chat and roleplay realm datasets to enhance conversation capability of LLMs.

6. A good Vietnamese bi-encoder model for advanced sentence embedding tasks.

7. Two base models - Vietnamese LLaMA2-7b pretrained on 40GB and 120GB of Vietnamese text, marking an advancement in understanding and generation for the language.

In summary, the main contributions are open datasets and pre-trained models to advance Vietnamese language understanding and generation through retrieval-augmented generation and large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with this paper appear to be:

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions continually pretraining the LLaMA2 model on additional Vietnamese and English data. What are some of the key considerations and challenges when doing continual pretraining of large language models? 

2. In Section 3.1, the authors describe the process of creating a Vietnamese NewsCorpus dataset. What steps did they take to clean and deduplicate the data? What impact would this have on the quality of the pretraining?

3. The paper utilizes different model configurations (e.g. GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) to generate the Vietnamese Alpaca datasets. How might the choice of model impact the diversity and quality of the generated instructions and data?

4. For the Self-Chat dataset, what techniques did the authors use to create a diverse set of conversation instructions? How do you think they assessed the quality and coverage of those instructions? 

5. In generating the Roleplay Realm dataset, what considerations went into creating compelling fictional characters that would lend themselves to quality roleplaying dialogues?

6. When training the Vietnamese bi-encoder model, what motivated the choice to use PhoBERT as the pretrained backbone? What advantages might this provide over other potential model choices?

7. For the continual pretraining of the LLaMA2 models, what hyperparameters and training configurations were used? What motivated these choices? 

8. The paper mentions retraining the Vietnamese tokenizer for LLaMA2. What impact would the tokenizer quality have on encoding Vietnamese text? How was the tokenizer improved?

9. What quality assurance and refinement processes were utilized by the authors for the crowdsourced and synthetically generated datasets? What specific issues were they screening for?

10. In Section 5 on conclusions, the authors discuss goals around linguistic inclusivity. In what ways could the resources and models presented in this paper help promote inclusivity for Vietnamese language understanding?
