# [Unleashing the Power of Imbalanced Modality Information for Multi-modal   Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) suffer from incompleteness, limiting their usage for downstream tasks. Multi-modal KGs (MMKGs) extend KGs with multi-modal information like images and text.  
- Existing multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) methods have two key limitations:
   1) They overlook the imbalance of modality information among entities, fusing modalities inflexibly.  
   2) They do not address the modality-missing problem where entity modal information is incomplete.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AdaMF-MAT, an MMKGC framework with Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion (AdaMF) and Modality Adversarial Training (MAT).

- AdaMF selectively extracts essential multi-modal features to generate representative joint embeddings, with adaptive weights for modalities.

- MAT generates synthetic adversarial multi-modal embeddings to enhance limited real embeddings. It creates adversarial samples for positive-negative contrast.

- AdaMF and MAT synergistically interact - AdaMF fuses existing embeddings while MAT enhances them.

Key Contributions:
- Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion (AdaMF) to handle imbalance and fuse modalities flexibly
- Modality Adversarial Training (MAT) strategy to augment limited multi-modal information
- Comprehensive experiments showing SOTA results on 3 benchmarks. 6.0% average MRR improvement over 19 baselines.
- Exploration of modality-missing scenarios proving suitability of AdaMF-MAT.

In summary, the paper tackles key limitations of existing MMKGC methods by proposing the AdaMF-MAT framework to unleash the power of imbalanced modality information. Experiments demonstrate clear state-of-the-art performance improvements.
