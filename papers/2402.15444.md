# [Unleashing the Power of Imbalanced Modality Information for Multi-modal   Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) suffer from incompleteness, limiting their usage for downstream tasks. Multi-modal KGs (MMKGs) extend KGs with multi-modal information like images and text.  
- Existing multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) methods have two key limitations:
   1) They overlook the imbalance of modality information among entities, fusing modalities inflexibly.  
   2) They do not address the modality-missing problem where entity modal information is incomplete.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AdaMF-MAT, an MMKGC framework with Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion (AdaMF) and Modality Adversarial Training (MAT).

- AdaMF selectively extracts essential multi-modal features to generate representative joint embeddings, with adaptive weights for modalities.

- MAT generates synthetic adversarial multi-modal embeddings to enhance limited real embeddings. It creates adversarial samples for positive-negative contrast.

- AdaMF and MAT synergistically interact - AdaMF fuses existing embeddings while MAT enhances them.

Key Contributions:
- Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion (AdaMF) to handle imbalance and fuse modalities flexibly
- Modality Adversarial Training (MAT) strategy to augment limited multi-modal information
- Comprehensive experiments showing SOTA results on 3 benchmarks. 6.0% average MRR improvement over 19 baselines.
- Exploration of modality-missing scenarios proving suitability of AdaMF-MAT.

In summary, the paper tackles key limitations of existing MMKGC methods by proposing the AdaMF-MAT framework to unleash the power of imbalanced modality information. Experiments demonstrate clear state-of-the-art performance improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new multi-modal knowledge graph completion framework called AdaMF-MAT that adaptively fuses imbalanced modality information and enhances it through modality-adversarial training to improve knowledge graph reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are three-fold:

1. It proposes adaptive multi-modal fusion (AdaMF) for multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC), to fuse the imbalanced modality information from three modalities (structural, visual, and textual) and produce representative joint embeddings.

2. It proposes a modality adversarial training (MAT) strategy to utilize imbalanced modality information. MAT aims to generate adversarial examples with synthetic multi-modal embeddings to enhance the MMKGC training. 

3. It conducts comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks to evaluate the performance of AdaMF-MAT. The results demonstrate that AdaMF-MAT can outperform 19 recent MMKGC baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art results on MMKGC.

In summary, the main contribution is a co-design of the MMKGC model (AdaMF) and training strategy (MAT) to unleash the power of imbalanced modality information for improving multi-modal knowledge graph completion.

The paper proposes a new MMKGC framework called AdaMF-MAT to address the limitations of existing methods in utilizing multi-modal information from images, text, and graph structure. The key ideas include using adaptive fusion to combine modalities and generating adversarial examples via modality-adversarial training to enhance the model. The method is evaluated on link prediction tasks on three benchmark MMKG datasets.

Some other potentially relevant terms based on a review of the content are modal imbalance, missing modalities, triple scoring, and state-of-the-art. But the ones listed initially are likely the core set of keywords and terms for this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an adaptive multi-modal fusion (AdaMF) mechanism. Can you explain in more detail how AdaMF works to achieve adaptive fusion of structural, visual, and textual modalities? 

2. The modality adversarial training (MAT) strategy generates synthetic multi-modal embeddings. What is the intuition behind using synthetic embeddings to enhance model training? How does MAT differ from existing negative sampling strategies?

3. The paper claims AdaMF and MAT are designed to synergistically interact. Can you elaborate on how the two modules complement each other and unleash the power of imbalanced modalities?

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using conditional generative adversarial networks in MAT compared to other adversarial training frameworks like WGAN or Unrolled GANs?

5. The ablation study shows removing different components hurts performance. Can you analyze the results to intuit which modules contribute the most to improvements?  

6. The case study visualizes changes in modality weights before and after MAT. What insights do the different distributions offer about how MAT influences adaptive fusion?

7. How suitable is the proposed method for extreme modality missing scenarios? What enhancements could make it more robust?

8. What other multi-modal tasks beyond knowledge graph completion could benefit from AdaMF and MAT's ability to handle imbalanced modalities?

9. The method uses a co-design of model architecture and training process. How does joint optimization compare to separately optimizing components? What challenges does it introduce?

10. How well would AdaMF and MAT transfer to large-scale industrial knowledge graphs with billions of entities and facts? What efficiency optimizations might be needed?
