# [Is Cognition and Action Consistent or Not: Investigating Large Language   Model's Personality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14679)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can reliably express human-like personality traits through their responses to personality questionnaires. Specifically, it examines the consistency between LLMs' professed personality inclinations (cognition) and their actual behavior (action) in real-world scenarios. 

Proposed Solution
The paper proposes a methodology to assess the reliability of LLM responses to personality questionnaires. It also develops metrics to quantify the cognition-action congruence of LLMs. Experiments are conducted on several LLMs by administering personality and scenario-based questionnaires. Responses are analyzed using similarity metrics.

Key Findings
- LLMs demonstrate some ability to mimic human-like personality tendencies but significant gaps exist between their cognition and action.  
- The cognition-action congruence of LLMs is substantially lower compared to humans.
- LLMs seem to align their questionnaire responses more closely to perceived societal expectations than genuine personality inclinations.

Main Contributions 
- A methodology to analyze the reliability of LLM responses to personality assessments
- Quantification of the cognition-action divergence of LLMs  
- Empirical analysis of various LLMs against established metrics
- Hypotheses and preliminary validation to understand the cognition-action discrepancy in LLMs

The paper signifies that while LLMs exhibit anthropomorphic capabilities, enhancing their ability to perform genuine human-like interactions remains an open research challenge.
