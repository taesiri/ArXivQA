# [Conformalized-DeepONet: A Distribution-Free Framework for Uncertainty   Quantification in Deep Operator Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15406)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are used to approximate operators that map between function spaces, and have shown success in scientific applications. However, quantifying uncertainty in DeepONet predictions remains an open challenge.

- Existing methods like Bayesian DeepONet (B-DeepONet) and Probabilistic DeepONet (Prob-DeepONet) provide heuristic measures of uncertainty, but do not guarantee coverage of the true values. 

- Constructing rigorous confidence intervals with coverage guarantees without making distributional assumptions is an unsolved problem.

Proposed Solution:

- The paper proposes using conformal prediction, a distribution-free framework, to construct confidence intervals with coverage guarantees for DeepONet regression.

- First, split conformal prediction is applied on top of B-DeepONet and Prob-DeepONet to enhance them to produce valid confidence intervals.

- Next, a new Quantile-DeepONet is introduced which estimates conditional quantiles of the DeepONet output. This allows a more natural use of split conformal prediction.

- Combining Quantile-DeepONet with split conformal prediction gives the Conformal Quantile-DeepONet algorithm that constructs nonparametric confidence intervals with finite sample coverage guarantees.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrated the use of split conformal prediction to equip B-DeepONet and Prob-DeepONet with the ability to produce rigorous confidence intervals.

- Designed the Quantile-DeepONet to estimate conditional quantiles for uncertainty quantification. Enables better utilization of split conformal prediction.

- Proposed the conformal Quantile-DeepONet regression algorithm for distribution-free and finite sample confidence intervals.

- Showcased the effectiveness on various numerical experiments, including nonlinear ODEs and PDEs. The conformalized DeepONets achieve the desired coverage.

In summary, the paper presented an effective framework leveraging conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in DeepONets with statistical coverage guarantees, without needing distributional assumptions.
