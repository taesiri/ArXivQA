# [ScAR: Scaling Adversarial Robustness for LiDAR Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03085)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks for 3D object detection are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of small perturbations to input data. 
- Existing adversarial attack methods like FGSM and PGD are universal and not optimized for 3D object detection. 
- White-box attacks require full access to the model, while black-box attacks have limited information.

Key Insights:
- Analyzed statistical distribution of annotation sizes in 3D detection datasets like KITTI, Waymo, nuScenes. Found Gaussian-shaped distributions centered around certain sizes.
- This means 3D detectors are sensitive to scaling, as they rarely observe instances outside the dominant sizes during training.

Proposed Methods:
- Three black-box scaling attack methods requiring different levels of information:
   1) Model-aware attack - requires access to prediction model
   2) Distribution-aware attack - requires distribution of ground truth boxes  
   3) Blind attack - no information required
- Defense method called Scaling Adversarial Robustness (ScAR) which transforms size distribution to uniform, making detector robust to different scales.

Key Results:
- Scaling attacks are very effective, reducing AP by 70-90% on different detectors. 
- ScARDefense is able to defend against scaling attacks, matching or exceeding performance of normal unattacked detectors.
- The more information attack has (model vs distribution vs blind), the more powerful it is. But ScAR proves robust even against most powerful model-aware attack.

Main Contributions:
- Novel analysis of 3D detection data distributions leading to scaling attack idea
- Black-box scaling attacks requiring different levels of info 
- ScAR defense method to transform detector's object size bias 
- Thorough experiments showing attack success and ScAR's robustness on multiple datasets and detectors
