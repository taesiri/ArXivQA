# [UniDAformer: Unified Domain Adaptive Panoptic Segmentation Transformer   via Hierarchical Mask Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform effective unified domain adaptive panoptic segmentation. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a unified end-to-end framework that can simultaneously adapt instance segmentation for 'things' and semantic segmentation for 'stuff' within a single network. 

The key hypothesis is that employing a hierarchical mask calibration technique can help mitigate the severe false prediction issue in unified domain adaptive panoptic segmentation. The proposed hierarchical calibration can progressively refine the predicted pseudo masks from region level to superpixel and pixel levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows correcting the pseudo masks on the fly during the unsupervised adaptation process.

In summary, the paper focuses on investigating a simple yet unified and effective approach for domain adaptive panoptic segmentation, with the core hypothesis that hierarchical calibration of predicted masks can suppress false predictions and enable more accurate unified adaptation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing UniDAformer, which is a unified domain adaptive panoptic segmentation transformer. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes UniDAformer, which is the first end-to-end unified domain adaptive panoptic segmentation transformer. It achieves domain adaptive instance segmentation and semantic segmentation simultaneously within a single network. This greatly reduces network parameters and simplifies training/inference compared to prior works that use separate networks.

- Designs a Hierarchical Mask Calibration (HMC) technique to calibrate predicted pseudo masks on the fly during self-training. HMC calibrates masks hierarchically from region level to superpixel and pixel levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows effective online self-training by correcting false predictions. 

- Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets. The unified architecture and online mask calibration enables higher accuracy and efficiency.

- The proposed ideas are general and HMC could be incorporated as a plug-in module. The mask calibration and online self-training approach could benefit other vision tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first unified end-to-end transformer for domain adaptive panoptic segmentation. The unified architecture and online mask calibration technique achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to prior arts.
