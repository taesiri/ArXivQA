# [UniDAformer: Unified Domain Adaptive Panoptic Segmentation Transformer   via Hierarchical Mask Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15083)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform effective unified domain adaptive panoptic segmentation. Specifically, the authors aim to develop a unified end-to-end framework that can simultaneously adapt instance segmentation for 'things' and semantic segmentation for 'stuff' within a single network. 

The key hypothesis is that employing a hierarchical mask calibration technique can help mitigate the severe false prediction issue in unified domain adaptive panoptic segmentation. The proposed hierarchical calibration can progressively refine the predicted pseudo masks from region level to superpixel and pixel levels in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows correcting the pseudo masks on the fly during the unsupervised adaptation process.

In summary, the paper focuses on investigating a simple yet unified and effective approach for domain adaptive panoptic segmentation, with the core hypothesis that hierarchical calibration of predicted masks can suppress false predictions and enable more accurate unified adaptation.
