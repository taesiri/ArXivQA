# [TARN-VIST: Topic Aware Reinforcement Network for Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Visual storytelling is the task of generating a coherent story from a sequence of images. Existing methods have limitations in capturing the latent topic information of the story, which is important for coherence and relevance. Lacking consideration of topic information leads to generated stories that are incoherent or irrelevant.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes TARN-VIST, a topic aware reinforcement learning framework for improving visual storytelling. The key ideas are:

1) Extract topic information from both visual and linguistic perspectives using CLIP and RAKE respectively. This provides complementary views of the story's central topic.

2) Design two topic consistency rewards based on cosine similarity between extracted topics and generated story topics. This guides the model to focus on topic coherence.

3) Combine the topic rewards with a BLEU reward in a reinforcement learning framework to optimize generation towards coherence and relevance.

Main Contributions:

1) A novel method to extract multi-modal (visual + linguistic) topic information for stories using CLIP and RAKE.

2) Formulation of two novel reward functions based on topic consistency measured by cosine similarity between extracted topics and generated topics.

3) Demonstration that optimizing with the proposed composite reward functions within a reinforcement learning framework significantly improves relevance, coherence and expressivity.

4) Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on VIST dataset across multiple metrics. Both automatic metrics and human evaluation confirm the benefits of incorporating topic information and rewards.

In summary, this paper makes multiple contributions in effectively utilizing topic information to enhance visual storytelling via a reinforcement learning approach with specifically designed rewards. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the utility of this method.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes TARN-VIST, a topic aware reinforcement learning framework for visual storytelling that extracts topic information from both visual and linguistic perspectives and uses topic consistency rewards to generate more coherent stories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors first take advantage of CLIP and RAKE together to extract topic information of stories from both visual and linguistic perspectives. 

2. To make full use of the topic information, the authors design reinforcement learning rewards for topic consistency based on the extracted topic information and cosine similarity.

3. Experimental results on the VIST dataset and human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms most of the competitive models across multiple evaluation metrics.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel visual storytelling model called TARN-VIST, which incorporates topic information extraction and topic-consistent reinforcement learning rewards to generate more coherent and relevant stories.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Visual storytelling - The main task that the paper focuses on. It aims to generate a story for an ordered image sequence automatically.

- Topic information - The paper extracts topic information from both visual and linguistic perspectives to help generate more coherent and relevant stories. It uses CLIP and RAKE to extract topic information. 

- Reinforcement learning - The paper incorporates reinforcement learning to refine the story generation process. It designs topic consistency rewards based on the extracted topic information to identify discrepancies between the generated story and human-labeled story.

- Encoder-decoder architecture - The proposed TARN-VIST model has an encoder-decoder architecture based on reinforcement learning. The encoder extracts image features and the decoder generates the story.

- VIST dataset - The benchmark dataset used to train and evaluate the model. It contains over 200,000 images and 10,000 albums.

- Evaluation metrics - The paper uses both automatic metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, etc.) and human evaluation to assess the quality of the generated stories.

In summary, the key focus of the paper is on extracting topic information and using reinforcement learning with custom topic-based rewards to improve story coherence in visual storytelling.
