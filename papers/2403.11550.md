# [TARN-VIST: Topic Aware Reinforcement Network for Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Visual storytelling is the task of generating a coherent story from a sequence of images. Existing methods have limitations in capturing the latent topic information of the story, which is important for coherence and relevance. Lacking consideration of topic information leads to generated stories that are incoherent or irrelevant.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes TARN-VIST, a topic aware reinforcement learning framework for improving visual storytelling. The key ideas are:

1) Extract topic information from both visual and linguistic perspectives using CLIP and RAKE respectively. This provides complementary views of the story's central topic.

2) Design two topic consistency rewards based on cosine similarity between extracted topics and generated story topics. This guides the model to focus on topic coherence.

3) Combine the topic rewards with a BLEU reward in a reinforcement learning framework to optimize generation towards coherence and relevance.

Main Contributions:

1) A novel method to extract multi-modal (visual + linguistic) topic information for stories using CLIP and RAKE.

2) Formulation of two novel reward functions based on topic consistency measured by cosine similarity between extracted topics and generated topics.

3) Demonstration that optimizing with the proposed composite reward functions within a reinforcement learning framework significantly improves relevance, coherence and expressivity.

4) Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on VIST dataset across multiple metrics. Both automatic metrics and human evaluation confirm the benefits of incorporating topic information and rewards.

In summary, this paper makes multiple contributions in effectively utilizing topic information to enhance visual storytelling via a reinforcement learning approach with specifically designed rewards. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments validate the utility of this method.
