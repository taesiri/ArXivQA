# [MOMA:Distill from Self-Supervised Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02089)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we effectively combine and transfer knowledge from two dominant paradigms in self-supervised learning - contrastive learning and masked image modeling - in an efficient and lightweight manner?

Specifically, the authors propose a method called MOMA to distill knowledge from pre-trained MoCo (momentum contrast) and MAE (masked autoencoder) models into a compact student model. The key ideas are:

- Use a MoCo model as teacher and MAE model as student, or vice versa, to transfer knowledge between the two paradigms

- Feed original images to teacher and masked images to student to enable efficient training

- Align representations between normalized teacher outputs and projected student outputs 

- Use extremely high masking ratios for faster training with fewer epochs

- Obtain a lightweight student model that fuses strengths of both contrastive learning and masked modeling

The goal is to develop an efficient knowledge distillation approach that combines strengths of the two leading self-supervised learning techniques to get a performant yet compact student model. The central hypothesis is that aligning representations between MoCo, MAE and a smaller student model can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposes MOMA, a method for knowledge distillation from pre-trained self-supervised models. Specifically, it distills knowledge from a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) model and a Momentum Contrast (MoCo) model into a student model. 

- Demonstrates that distilling from both MAE and MoCo teachers leads to better performance than using either one alone as the teacher. This shows that MAE and MoCo contain complementary knowledge.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet image classification using an efficient distillation approach. MOMA reaches 84.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet while using 5-16x fewer training epochs than other self-supervised methods.

- Introduces an asymmetric siamese network structure for distillation, where the teacher sees unmasked images and the student sees masked images. This makes the learning more efficient and challenging.

- Shows strong transfer learning performance on downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and image classification using representations learned by MOMA.

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient knowledge distillation approach to combine complementary knowledge from two major self-supervised learning paradigms (MAE and MoCo), achieving excellent performance with fewer compute requirements.
