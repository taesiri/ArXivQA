# [Exploring the Residual Stream of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12141)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is limited understanding of how transformer models make next word predictions, including where the key knowledge is stored and how it contributes to the predictions. 

- Specific questions include: where are the important parameters stored, are they in one layer or spread across layers, which modules (attention/FFN) contain them, how to quantify contributions of layers/modules, whether parameters contribute directly or by activating others.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze the residual connections in transformers, including layer-level and subvalue-level residual streams. 

- Find distribution change caused by direct addition on before-softmax (bs) values. Tokens with higher bs-values in added vector will increase in probability.

- Prove log probability increase is a reasonable contribution score to locate helpful layers/subvalues.

- Compute inner products between vectors to see which layers activate FFN subvalues.

- Conduct analysis on random cases and a case study.

Main Contributions:

1) Explain distribution change via bs-values, show probabilities increase for tokens with higher bs-values after vector addition.

2) Log probability increase as contribution score to identify important layers/subvalues. Show scores have linear relationship.  

3) Method to evaluate how previous layers affect FFN subvalues.

4) Experimental results and case study verify ability to increase interpretability of transformers and locate knowledge storage.

In summary, the paper explores transformers, especially the residual connections, using mathematical analysis and experiments. It makes several contributions toward explaining and interpreting predictions in transformer models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores the residual stream of transformers to understand the mechanism behind distribution changes between layers, proposes methods to quantify layer and sublayer contributions, and applies these techniques in a case study to locate knowledge and analyze cross-layer interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors find that the mechanism behind the residual connections in transformers can be explained by looking at the before-softmax (bs) values. Specifically, they show that the distribution change caused by adding two vectors is due to a direct addition on their bs-values. Tokens with larger bs-values will see an increase in their probabilities.

2) The authors propose using the log probability increase as a reasonable contribution score to identify important layers and subvalues for predicting the next word. They also show the relationship between contribution scores is linear and monotonically increasing.

3) The authors propose a method to analyze how previous layers, especially attention layers, affect the activation of FFN subvalues in upper layers. This is done by comparing the inner products between layer outputs and the FFN subvalue keys.

4) Through experiments and case studies, the authors demonstrate their proposed methods can increase the interpretability of transformers by locating helpful parameters, analyzing the roles of subvalues as both "values" and "queries", and providing some explanation for the model's prediction.

In summary, the main contribution is in explaining the inner workings of transformers, especially the role of residual connections, and developing methods to increase their interpretability. The analysis of how layers and subvalues contribute as both "values" and "queries" is a key insight.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Residual stream of transformers - Analyzing how the residual connections in transformer models pass information between layers.

- Before-softmax (bs) values - The dot product between the embedding vector and the layer output vector, before applying the softmax. Helpful for analyzing distribution changes.  

- Contribution scores - Proposed method to quantify a layer or sublayer's contribution to the model's next word prediction, using log probability increase.

- Subvalue residual stream - How the attention outputs and feedforward outputs are computed from subvalues in each layer.  

- Query vectors and value vectors - Model parameters that act as queries to activate other parameters, versus parameters that directly store knowledge.

- Cross-layer analysis - Analyzing how previous layers affect later feedforward sublayers, by looking at things like inner products and contribution scores.

- Case study - Applying the analysis on a specific next word prediction example to trace where factual knowledge is stored and how sublayers contribute.

So in summary, key ideas include quantifying layer contributions, distinguishing query/value roles of parameters, analyzing residual connections, and doing cross-layer analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1) The paper finds that the distribution change caused by residual connections is due to direct addition on the before-softmax (bs) values. Why is looking at the bs values more insightful than just analyzing the probability changes? What are some limitations of only considering probability changes?

2) The paper proposes using log probability increase as the contribution score for layers and subvalues. Why is this more reasonable than using raw probability increase? What are some potential issues with using log probability increase? 

3) How does the paper evaluate the cross-layer contribution of previous layers on activating FFN subvalues? What role does layer normalization play in this analysis? What are limitations of the inner product method proposed?

4) The paper categorizes transformer parameters as either "values" that directly contribute by changing distributions, or "queries" that activate other parameters. What are some challenges in clearly separating these two categories? Could the same parameters act as both queries and values?

5) For the case study on "The capital of France is Paris", what specific knowledge seems to be encoded in the FFN vs attention subvalues? How do you interpret the different roles of helpful vs unhelpful FFN subvalues?

6) The cross-layer analysis explores FFN subvalues working as queries vs values. What trends are found regarding which layers specialize in these two roles? How could editing factual knowledge be impacted by subvalues having dual query/value roles?  

7) The analysis relies heavily on a 16-layer decoder-only transformer. How could the residual stream mechanisms differ in much larger models like GPT-3? What are the challenges in scaling this analysis?

8) Attention subvalues depend on both the attention weights and values (Eq. 7). The paper's analysis seems to focus more on the value matrix - why is this? What further analysis could be done on the role of attention weights?

9) What types of inputs/cases would be most insightful to explore using the paper's proposed analysis methods? How could focused analysis on different linguistic phenomena provide further mechanistic insights? 

10) The paper claims the analysis increases model interpretability. In what ways does the residual stream analysis provide more meaningful or actionable insights compared to other interpretation methods? What aspects of model behavior still remain uninterpretable?
