# [Intraoperative 2D/3D Image Registration via Differentiable X-ray   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06358)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents DiffPose, a self-supervised framework for differentiable 2D/3D image registration that aligns intraoperative X-rays with preoperative CT scans. The key idea is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in a patient-specific manner to regress the pose of synthetic X-rays rendered from the patient's CT scan. This avoids the need for manual annotations while allowing the CNN to encode patient-specific anatomical information. The network is trained with a combination of image similarity losses between the synthetic and rendered X-rays as well as geodesic losses between the predicted and ground truth poses. At test time, the network rapidly estimates the pose of a real intraoperative X-ray, which is then refined using a differentiable renderer and a multiscale variant of normalized cross correlation to perform test-time optimization. By operating directly in the Lie algebra se(3), avoiding common deficiencies in other representations, and using sparse rendering techniques, the system achieves real-time performance while improving accuracy over existing methods by an order of magnitude. Experiments across distinct anatomical regions and surgical procedures demonstrate consistent sub-millimeter accuracy without any expert supervision or landmark annotations.
