# [Towards Explainability and Fairness in Swiss Judgement Prediction:   Benchmarking on a Multilingual Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing explainability and fairness is crucial for building trustworthy legal judgement prediction (LJP) systems. However, current LJP systems rely on correlational factors that may lack legal relevance or involve sensitive attributes, leading to opaque and potentially biased decisions.  

- This paper focuses on the Swiss Judgement Prediction (SJP) dataset, the only publicly available multilingual LJP dataset (German, French, Italian), to evaluate explainability and fairness.

Approach:
- The authors curate a dataset of 108 cases annotated by legal experts with rationales that "support" or "oppose" the judgement. 

- Using occlusion analysis, they evaluate how well state-of-the-art SJP models align with the expert rationales when key sentences are removed. This tests the local explainability of predictions.

- They also propose a novel technique called Lower Court Insertion (LCI) to quantify prediction bias related to the lower court by swapping lower court names. This assesses counterfactual fairness.

Key Contributions:

- Release an expert-annotated rationale dataset in 3 languages and 4 occlusion test sets to enable explainability evaluation of SJP models.

- Empirically demonstrate on six model variants that improved predictive performance does not translate to enhanced explainability, highlighting the need for explicit evaluation.

- Introduce the LCI evaluation technique and find substantial flip rates and confidence score changes from modifying just the lower court name, revealing significant bias.

- The analysis provides valuable insights into progress still required for reliable and transparent LJP systems that avoid perpetuating unfair discrimination. The data resources introduced will facilitate further research.
