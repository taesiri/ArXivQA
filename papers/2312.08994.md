## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PANDA, an innovative architecture-level power modeling solution that combines analytical and machine learning techniques to achieve unprecedented accuracy. PANDA adopts an analytical framework to model individual CPU components, integrating a simple customized analytical function and an ML model for each component. The analytical function captures primary patterns based on key configuration parameters, while the ML model learns more complex detailed correlations. This allows PANDA to significantly outperform prior analytical methods like McPAT and ML methods, especially when training data is very limited. PANDA trains the ML model to predict power divided by the analytical resource function, enabling more consistent distributions for the ML model to learn. Experiments show PANDA reduces error by 30% over state-of-the-art methods given only 1 training sample. Besides power modeling, PANDA also enables accurate prediction of performance, area, and energy of architecture designs. It further supports prediction for unknown new technology nodes through a transfer learning approach. PANDA proves highly useful in assisting architecture design space exploration. With wide applicability and easy adoption, PANDA is a compelling power modeling solution for computer architects.
