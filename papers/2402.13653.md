# [PQA: Zero-shot Protein Question Answering for Free-form Scientific   Enquiry with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13653)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Proteins play a critical role in biological functions and research. However, studying their biochemical properties computationally currently relies on task-specific models requiring extensive data collection and training. This limits flexible scientific enquiry into protein functionalities. The authors introduce the new challenge of zero-shot Protein Question Answering (PQA) to address this limitation. The goal is to enable free-form questioning and open-ended answering about the functional properties of previously unseen protein sequences using only their amino acid sequence as input.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop Pika, an end-to-end framework for scientific PQA combining protein language models like ESM2 with large pre-trained language models like Phi-2. They contribute Pika-DS, a specialized dataset with over 250K protein sequences annotated with nearly 2 million expert-curated question-answer pairs covering diverse biochemical concepts. Two multimodal neural architectures, Cross-Pika and Self-Pika, are proposed to integrate information from the protein and text modalities. The authors also introduce light-weight and rigorous biochemistry-focused benchmarks, Biochem-Lite and Biochem-ReAct, to evaluate scientific accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the novel zero-shot PQA task to enable free-form scientific questioning of protein sequences
- Pika framework with specialized PQA dataset, novel multimodal architectures, and biochemically relevant benchmarks  
- Establishing SOTA results on Biochem-Lite and Biochem-ReAct through Self-Pika model
- Insights on key factors influencing multimodal PQA performance through ablation studies
- Evidence that Biochem-Lite benchmarks can predict real-world biochemical accuracy

The work represents an important advancement towards flexible computational protein research through seamless integration of protein representations and natural language questioning.
