# [In-Hand Following of Deformable Linear Objects Using Dexterous Fingers   with Tactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) like cables and ropes is challenging for robots. Most prior work assumes rigid grasping of DLOs. However, humans often use dexterous in-hand manipulation like following a DLO while sliding the grasp point along it.  
- Achieving such in-hand DLO following with a robot is difficult without specialized grippers. Using parallel jaw grippers has issues balancing holding vs sliding forces. This leads to limited robustness and needing frequent regrasps.

Proposed Solution:
- The key idea is using a dexterous hand with tactile sensors to imitate human manipulation skills for robust DLO following.
- A control framework is proposed involving (i) multi-objective IK solving for precise Cartesian-space control, (ii) hybrid position/force control of the hand, (iii) tactile sensing to estimate 3D in-hand DLO poses.
- Building on these capabilities, human-inspired motions are designed for the hand to follow DLOs similar to forming a V-shape with the fingers. This separates holding vs sliding forces.

Contributions:
- Pioneers using a dexterous hand and tactile sensing for real-world in-hand DLO following, enabled by a integrated control and sensing framework.
- Shows significantly improved robustness over parallel jaw gripper methods, generalizability to varying materials/shapes/speeds.
- The approach is application-agnostic and could enable dexterous in-hand DLO manipulation for other high-level tasks.
- Analysis is provided on limitations of parallel grippers and how the extra DOFs of the dexterous hand help overcome these.

In summary, this paper explores a promising new direction of leveraging dexterous hands and tactile sensing to achieve complex in-hand DLO manipulation comparable to human skills. The integrated framework developed showcases such capabilities on the representative task of robust DLO following.
