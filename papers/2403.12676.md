# [In-Hand Following of Deformable Linear Objects Using Dexterous Fingers   with Tactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) like cables and ropes is challenging for robots. Most prior work assumes rigid grasping of DLOs. However, humans often use dexterous in-hand manipulation like following a DLO while sliding the grasp point along it.  
- Achieving such in-hand DLO following with a robot is difficult without specialized grippers. Using parallel jaw grippers has issues balancing holding vs sliding forces. This leads to limited robustness and needing frequent regrasps.

Proposed Solution:
- The key idea is using a dexterous hand with tactile sensors to imitate human manipulation skills for robust DLO following.
- A control framework is proposed involving (i) multi-objective IK solving for precise Cartesian-space control, (ii) hybrid position/force control of the hand, (iii) tactile sensing to estimate 3D in-hand DLO poses.
- Building on these capabilities, human-inspired motions are designed for the hand to follow DLOs similar to forming a V-shape with the fingers. This separates holding vs sliding forces.

Contributions:
- Pioneers using a dexterous hand and tactile sensing for real-world in-hand DLO following, enabled by a integrated control and sensing framework.
- Shows significantly improved robustness over parallel jaw gripper methods, generalizability to varying materials/shapes/speeds.
- The approach is application-agnostic and could enable dexterous in-hand DLO manipulation for other high-level tasks.
- Analysis is provided on limitations of parallel grippers and how the extra DOFs of the dexterous hand help overcome these.

In summary, this paper explores a promising new direction of leveraging dexterous hands and tactile sensing to achieve complex in-hand DLO manipulation comparable to human skills. The integrated framework developed showcases such capabilities on the representative task of robust DLO following.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a control and sensing framework to enable dexterous in-hand following of deformable linear objects using a generic anthropomorphic hand with tactile sensors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a control and sensing framework to enable a generic dexterous hand with tactile sensing to achieve robust in-hand following of deformable linear objects (DLOs). Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) An optimization-based inverse kinematics (IK) solver to achieve Cartesian-space control of the arm-hand system.

2) A tactile-based approach to estimate the in-hand 3D pose of the DLO from two GelSight sensors. 

3) Task-specific motion design to enable the dexterous hand to follow DLOs in a human-like manner, which is significantly more robust than existing methods based on parallel grippers.

4) Extensive real-world experiments that validate the proposed methods and demonstrate their superiority over parallel grippers in robustness, generalizability and efficiency for the DLO following task.

In summary, this paper pioneers the exploration of using dexterous hands for in-hand DLO manipulation, by proposing a generic control and sensing framework to achieve human-like dexterous following of DLOs.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Deformable linear objects (DLOs): The paper focuses on manipulating deformable linear objects like cables and ropes.

- In-hand following: The paper introduces the task of "in-hand DLO following", which refers to sliding along a DLO while holding it to prevent it from falling. 

- Dexterous hands: The paper explores using a dexterous robotic hand, specifically the LEAP Hand, to achieve robust DLO following.

- Tactile sensing: Tactile sensors, specifically GelSight Mini sensors, are mounted on the dexterous hand's fingertips to estimate the in-hand DLO state.

- Control framework: A control framework is proposed to enable Cartesian-space control of the arm-hand system.

- Sensing framework: A tactile sensing framework is introduced to estimate the 3D pose of the DLO within the hand.
