# [Interpretable User Satisfaction Estimation for Conversational Systems   with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12388)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately estimating user satisfaction in conversational systems like chatbots is critical for evaluation and improvement. 
- Existing approaches using featurized ML models or embeddings have limitations in interpretability and generalizability across diverse conversational patterns.

Proposed Solution - SPUR:
- Uses large language models (LLMs) to extract interpretable satisfaction signals from user utterances more effectively. 
- Introduces a 3-step iterative prompting framework:
   1) Supervised Extraction: Extract possible SAT/DSAT patterns from labeled conversations using LLM
   2) Rubric Summarization: Summarize prominent patterns into clear rubrics  
   3) User Satisfaction Estimation: Apply learned rubrics to unseen conversations to predict satisfaction
- Tailors the LLM to target domain using supervision from labeled examples to learn domain-specific rubrics.

Key Contributions:
- Higher accuracy for user satisfaction estimation compared to baselines
- Generates interpretable rubrics to identify reasons for satisfaction/dissatisfaction  
- Generalizable - automatically learns diverse rubrics for different conversational systems
- Scalability - rubrics can be distilled into embeddings and used as features in ML models
- Analysis provides insights into different satisfaction patterns across domains

In summary, the paper introduces a novel prompting framework called SPUR that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to provide an accurate and interpretable approach to user satisfaction estimation across diverse conversational systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel framework called Supervised Prompting for User satisfaction Rubrics (SPUR) that uses a large language model to accurately and interpretably estimate user satisfaction in conversational systems by learning rubrics that identify patterns indicating satisfaction and dissatisfaction from labeled conversation examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1. Proposing SPUR (Supervised Prompting for User satisfaction Rubrics), a novel framework for estimating user satisfaction in conversational systems using large language models (LLMs). 

2. Showing that SPUR can extract interpretable signals of user satisfaction from natural language utterances more effectively than embedding-based approaches. It scores user satisfaction via learned rubrics that provide a detailed breakdown.

3. Demonstrating that SPUR outperforms existing methods across different types of conversational systems, especially when training data is limited. It also provides insights into the factors that influence user satisfaction.

4. Presenting methods to scale the application of the learned rubrics using knowledge distillation and by adding rubric items as features to embedding-based models when more training data is available.

5. Highlighting the ability of SPUR to automatically learn satisfied and dissatisfied conversational patterns as rubrics for different conversational systems, allowing the approach to generalize across domains.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an interpretable and accurate framework called SPUR for estimating user satisfaction in conversational systems using the reasoning and pattern extraction capabilities of large language models.

The paper proposes a framework called "Supervised Prompting for User satisfaction Rubrics" (SPUR) that uses an LLM with iterative prompting to extract interpretable signals of user satisfaction from conversations. Key aspects include supervised extraction of satisfaction patterns, summarization of patterns into rubrics, scoring conversations based on rubrics, comparison to embedding methods, knowledge distillation to scale the approach, and analysis of satisfaction factors in different conversational systems. The goal is to develop a more accurate and interpretable approach to user satisfaction estimation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an iterative prompting framework with three main steps: Supervised Extraction, Rubric Summarization, and User Satisfaction Estimation. Can you walk through each of these steps in more detail and explain the rationale behind this approach? 

2. In the Supervised Extraction step, the authors prompt GPT-4 to extract the top 3 satisfaction and dissatisfaction patterns from each labeled conversation. What is the advantage of letting the LLM extract these patterns in a data-driven way compared to manually defining satisfaction metrics?

3. The Rubric Summarization step condenses the extracted patterns into a consistent 10-item rubric. Why is rubric generalization important here? Does further condensing the patterns into fewer items reduce model accuracy? 

4. For scoring user satisfaction, the prompt asks GPT-4 to make binary decisions on whether each rubric item appears in the conversation, and then score its likely impact on overall satisfaction. What is the benefit of decomposing the scoring this way compared to having the LLM output a single satisfaction score?

5. Figure 3 shows the correlation between rubric items and user click feedback. Are there any interesting trends in terms of which types of patterns have higher or lower correlations? Why might that be?

6. In the cross-domain experiments, we see lower performance when applying rubrics learned on Bing Copilot data to task-oriented domains. What underlying differences between these domains lead to this drop, and how does re-learning domain-specific rubrics boost performance?

7. For knowledge distillation, logistic regression is used to predict rubric labels from conversation embeddings. What embedding worked best here? How much data was used for distillation and what was the final classifier performance? 

8. When combining rubric scores with conversation embeddings as input features for linear regression, we see improved satisfaction prediction accuracy. Why do you think adding these high-level satisfaction metrics to embeddings is beneficial?

9. The paper demonstrates satisfying accuracy for few-shot prompting during evaluation, but notes that efficiency remains a limitation when applying it at scale. What ideas do you have to address this limitation while retaining interpretability?

10. An interesting finding is that users provide more positive explicit feedback and more negative implicit feedback based on conversational patterns. What implications does this have for the design of user satisfaction evaluation systems?
