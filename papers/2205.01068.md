# OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop large language models with capabilities comparable to GPT-3, while also applying best practices around data curation, training efficiency, and responsible AI?More specifically, the authors seem focused on the following goals:- Replicate the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models using the latest techniques for efficient training. - Curate high-quality training data and apply deduplication to reduce risk of training instabilities.- Match GPT-3 capabilities in areas like few-shot learning while using only 1/7th the computing resources.- Release model weights to enable further research into responsible AI for large language models.- Provide extensive details and documentation around the model training process to increase transparency.So in summary, the central research question seems to be around replicating and responsibly releasing models like GPT-3 in an open and transparent manner, to enable further research and discussion around large language models. The authors aim to match GPT-3 capabilities while improving training efficiency and data quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing OPT, a new suite of open-sourced pretrained language models ranging from 125M to 175B parameters. The models are aimed to match the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models.2. Sharing implementation details and training methodology used for OPT, including using the latest practices for efficient training and data curation. For example, the authors achieved 147 TFLOP/s utilization per GPU and used only 1/7th the carbon footprint compared to training GPT-3.3. Providing comprehensive evaluations of the OPT models on NLP tasks, dialogue, and responsible AI benchmarks. The models achieve parity with GPT-3 on most NLP tasks and can generate high-quality dialogue without task-specific fine-tuning.4. Releasing the models and code to enable broader access and research into large language models. The authors aim to bring more voices into studying the limitations and ethical considerations around deploying such models.5. Discussing in detail the limitations of OPT and considerations around responsible release of large models. The authors recommend not using OPT for real-world deployments yet.In summary, the main contribution is presenting OPT, a suite of open-sourced models comparable to GPT-3 that can enable more research into large language models, while using efficient training methods and highlighting responsible AI concerns. The release aims to increase transparency and diversity of voices around developing and studying such models.
