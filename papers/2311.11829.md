# [System 2 Attention (is something you might need too)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11829)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces System 2 Attention (S2A), a new attention mechanism for transformer-based large language models (LLMs) that aims to reduce the impact of irrelevant or misleading information in the input context. S2A leverages the reasoning and text generation capabilities of LLMs to regenerate the input context, removing extraneous details before attending and generating a response. Specifically, the LLM is prompted to rewrite the context to only include relevant information for answering the question or query. This helps prevent the LLM's latent representations from being adversely influenced by spurious correlations in the full input context, which can lead to factual mistakes, opinionated responses, or sycophantic agreement with the input. Experiments on question answering, argument generation, and math word problems demonstrate S2A's ability to improve the factuality, objectivity, and accuracy of LLM generations by deliberately focusing attention on the essential parts of the context. The authors motivate S2A as bringing more deliberate, human-like "System 2" reasoning into the automatic "System 1" associations of standard soft attention transformers. Overall, S2A offers a promising approach to overcoming issues with relevance and spurious correlations in LLMs by utilizing their own reasoning and text generation skills.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents System 2 Attention (S2A), a technique that uses large language models to regenerate input contexts to only include relevant information before attending and generating outputs, improving performance on tasks containing irrelevant or biased context.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a new method called System 2 Attention (S2A) to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. The key idea is to have the LLM regenerate the input context to focus only on the relevant information before generating a response. This is motivated by the fact that standard soft attention in LLMs tends to incorporate and be swayed by irrelevant or spurious information. S2A is implemented by prompting the LLM to rewrite the context, removing irrelevant or biased portions. Experiments on question answering, math word problems, and longform generation tasks demonstrate S2A can increase factuality, objectivity, and accuracy compared to regular LLMs. For example, on a QA dataset with opinions added, S2A boosts accuracy from 62.8% to 80.3% by removing those opinions that mislead the LLM. The authors posit S2A acts analogously to humans consciously controlling their attention (system 2 reasoning) to overcome automatic biases (system 1 reasoning). Overall, S2A showcases improving LLMs via leveraging their reasoning and text generation abilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces System 2 Attention (S2A), a technique that allows large language models to deliberately regenerate an input context to only include the most relevant information. This helps the model avoid being misled by spurious correlations and improves the factual accuracy and objectivity of the model's responses.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes and evaluates a method called System 2 Attention (S2A) to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). 

The key hypothesis is that the standard soft attention mechanism used in LLMs is susceptible to incorporating irrelevant information from the context, which can adversely affect next token generations. For example, opinions or irrelevant facts in the context may sway an LLM's answer to a factual question. 

To address this, S2A has the LLM regenerate the input context to only include relevant portions before attending and generating a response. The paper hypothesizes this deliberate attention approach can increase factuality and objectivity compared to standard LLMs.

So in summary, the central research question is: Can having an LLM regenerate only relevant context improve the factual accuracy and objectivity of its responses over standard soft attention mechanisms? The paper aims to test this hypothesis through experiments on question answering, argument generation and math word problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing System 2 Attention (S2A), a new attention mechanism for large language models. 

The key ideas behind S2A are:

- Leveraging the reasoning and natural language generation capabilities of LLMs to decide what context is relevant to attend to. 

- Prompting the LLM to regenerate the input context, removing any irrelevant or distracting portions that could adversely affect the model's predictions. 

- Applying attention in the usual way but on the regenerated context instead of the original context.

So in summary, S2A uses the LLM itself to perform a kind of "hard" attention on the input context, removing distractors and focusing only on relevant information before generating a response. This is motivated by shortcomings of standard "soft" attention in LLMs which can attend universally and be swayed by spurious correlations.

Experiments show S2A can improve performance on tasks where irrelevant context is present, like QA with opinions, math word problems with distractors, and argumentative text generation. The method increases factuality, objectivity and accuracy compared to standard LLMs with normal attention.

So the core contribution is proposing and evaluating this new type of reasoning-based attention mechanism for LLMs. It's a simple idea that demonstrates how we can take advantage of LLMs' own capabilities to improve their reasoning in context.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis comparing this paper to related work:

This paper introduces System 2 Attention (S2A), a new approach to attention mechanisms in large language models (LLMs). S2A leverages the reasoning abilities of LLMs to regenerate input contexts, removing irrelevant or distracting information before attending and generating outputs. This is a novel way to approach the limitations of standard soft attention in LLMs, which can incorporate unwanted biases or spurious correlations from full input contexts. 

Related work has studied the issues of repetition, irrelevant context, and sycophancy in LLMs, showing how they degrade performance. Methods to address these have included additional training, reinforcement learning, or prompting techniques. However, S2A offers a different perspective by reformulating the context itself based on the model's understanding. 

Other related work has employed LLMs for query rewriting or response refinement. While complementary, these approaches focus on modifying the query or response rather than regenerating the context. S2A is most similar to query rewriting but with the key difference of operating on full input contexts rather than just the question.

Overall, S2A proposes a new paradigm for attention in LLMs that leverages their reasoning and language generation capabilities. The results demonstrate improved performance on question answering, argument generation, and math word problems. The approach contrasts with other methods that aim to alter model objectives or training procedures, instead using the model's own knowledge to rewrite contexts. This novel framework for deliberative attention aligns with psychological notions like dual process theory.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Fine-tuning or using reinforcement learning to optimize System 2 Attention (S2A) further beyond the zero-shot prompting approach used in this work.

- Distilling successful S2A generations back into standard transformer models, by fine-tuning on original prompts and using S2A outputs as training targets. 

- Optimizing the prompting approach for S2A, as the current prompts used were not extensively tuned. Training data that maps original contexts to regenerated S2A contexts could help with more optimal prompting.

- Exploring alternative methods to speed up S2A, such as only generating the differences from the original context, referencing sections instead of copying large amounts of text, etc.

- Testing complementary methods like chain-of-thought reasoning as part of the S2A generation process.

- Applying S2A to additional domains beyond the tasks explored in this paper.

So in summary, the key future directions are: optimizing S2A further via techniques like fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and prompting; distilling successful S2A into standard models; speeding up S2A; using complementary reasoning methods; and extending S2A to new domains. The authors highlight the interpretability of S2A as an opportunity for creating training data in the future.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- System 1 and System 2 reasoning - The paper draws on the distinction between fast, automatic System 1 thinking and slower, more deliberate System 2 thinking. S2A is presented as a System 2 style attention mechanism to compensate for issues with standard transformer soft attention (viewed as more System 1 style).

- Attention mechanisms - The paper focuses on developing a new attention approach called System 2 Attention (S2A) to improve on standard transformer soft attention.  

- Reasoning in LLMs - The method uses the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, via prompting/instruction following, in order to perform the context regeneration required for S2A.

- Removing irrelevant context - A core goal of S2A is to rewrite the context to remove parts that are irrelevant or contain unwanted biases/opinions, before the LLM attends to generate the final output.

- Mitigating spurious correlations - By extracting relevant context, S2A aims to avoid spurious correlations that skew LLM predictions. This helps alleviate issues like repetition, susceptibility to opinion bias, and sycophancy.

- Improving factuality and objectivity - Experiments show S2A can increase factual accuracy and objectivity by ignoring distracting or irrelevant information that harms standard LLM performance.

- Prompting methods - The approach relies on a two-step prompting process to instruct the LLM to perform context regeneration and final generation.

So in summary, the key terms cover: the System 1/System 2 reasoning analogy, transformer attention mechanisms, leveraging LLM reasoning abilities, removing irrelevant context via regeneration, mitigating spurious correlations, improving factuality/objectivity, and prompting methods.
