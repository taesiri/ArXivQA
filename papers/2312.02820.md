# [Clustering Pseudo Language Family in Multilingual Translation Models   with Fisher Information Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02820)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for clustering multilingual neural machine translation models into "pseudo language families" to improve performance on low-resource language pairs. The key idea is to leverage the fisher information matrix (FIM) to quantify similarities between language pairs based on their impact on model parameters. Three methods are introduced to calculate these similarities: mean square error, KL divergence, and overlap similarity. The overlap method selects the top 40% of parameters based on FIM to create a "fisher information mask" for comparing language pairs. These similarities are then used to cluster languages into pseudo families that may cross traditional language family boundaries. Experiments show that fine-tuning the m2m100 model on these pseudo families boosts performance on low-resource translation by 1.7 BLEU points over just using the traditional language family. The method is robust across datasets and does not require access to the original training data or model architecture. Overall, it provides an effective data-driven approach to group beneficial languages for multilingual translation without relying solely on linguistic relationships.
