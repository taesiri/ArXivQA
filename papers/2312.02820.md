# [Clustering Pseudo Language Family in Multilingual Translation Models   with Fisher Information Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) models can translate multiple languages in one model. However, determining the best auxiliary languages to include during training to maximize performance on a given low-resource language pair remains a challenge. 
- Existing methods rely on linguistic knowledge about language families or modifications to model architecture, making them less flexible.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method to cluster "pseudo language families" tailored to a given MNMT model's parameters. 
- The key idea is to leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to quantify the similarity of the impact each language pair has on the model parameters during training. 
- Languages that affect the parameters most similarly are clustered into a "pseudo family" that is used together during the MNMT fine-tuning process.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces an innovative FIM-based method to measure language similarities and cluster pseudo families without needing extra resources or model changes.
- Proposes three strategies (MSE, KL divergence, Overlap) to compute language pair similarities with FIM.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art BLEU score improvements averaging 1.7 points over linguistic language families when using pseudo families for MNMT fine-tuning.
- Shows the approach can uncover non-intuitive beneficial language pairs and is robust across diverse datasets.
- Overall, provides an adaptable way to boost low-resource MNMT performance by better selecting auxiliary languages during training.
