# [Clustering Pseudo Language Family in Multilingual Translation Models   with Fisher Information Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) models can translate multiple languages in one model. However, determining the best auxiliary languages to include during training to maximize performance on a given low-resource language pair remains a challenge. 
- Existing methods rely on linguistic knowledge about language families or modifications to model architecture, making them less flexible.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method to cluster "pseudo language families" tailored to a given MNMT model's parameters. 
- The key idea is to leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to quantify the similarity of the impact each language pair has on the model parameters during training. 
- Languages that affect the parameters most similarly are clustered into a "pseudo family" that is used together during the MNMT fine-tuning process.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces an innovative FIM-based method to measure language similarities and cluster pseudo families without needing extra resources or model changes.
- Proposes three strategies (MSE, KL divergence, Overlap) to compute language pair similarities with FIM.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art BLEU score improvements averaging 1.7 points over linguistic language families when using pseudo families for MNMT fine-tuning.
- Shows the approach can uncover non-intuitive beneficial language pairs and is robust across diverse datasets.
- Overall, provides an adaptable way to boost low-resource MNMT performance by better selecting auxiliary languages during training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel method to cluster multilingual translation model languages into pseudo families based on parameter similarities measured by the Fisher information matrix, and shows its effectiveness in improving low-resource translation adaptation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents a new methodology for clustering language families that is designed to work without needing access to the training data or making architectural modifications. 

2. It introduces three efficient methods based on the Fisher Information Matrix to comprehensively compute similarities between language pairs. 

3. Empirical evaluations show that the clustered pseudo language families proposed in this paper exhibit superior performance compared to conventional language families. The approach also shows versatility in easily adapting to scenarios that require language clustering.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel way of clustering pseudo language families for multilingual neural machine translation, which outperforms clustering based on traditional language families. The key advantages are not needing access to the training data/model architecture and having versatility across scenarios requiring language similarity measurements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to quantify similarities between language pairs. What are the key motivations and hypothesized benefits of using FIM over other representation learning techniques for this task?

2. The paper describes 3 variants for computing language pair similarities using FIM - MSE, KL divergence, and Overlap similarity. Can you explain the key differences between these 3 approaches and why Overlap similarity was ultimately selected as the best performer? 

3. The feed-forward networks (FFN) were found to contain over 60% of the highest FIM parameters. Why are FFN parameters so informative for this language similarity task compared to other parts of the Transformer model?

4. The Overlap similarity method requires selecting a threshold hyperparameter K to determine how many top FIM parameters to use. Walk through how you would systematically select the optimal value for K? 

5. When forming pseudo language families, the paper proposes a gap-based clustering algorithm that expands the selection radius in a decelerating manner. Explain the rationale behind this heuristic and its benefits over conventional clustering techniques.

6. The paper demonstrates how the proposed pseudo language families outperform linguistic language families for low-resource translation fine-tuning. Probe deeper into the results - for which specific language pairs do you see the largest gains and why?

7. The paper shows Korean was selected as an auxiliary language for Farsi translation despite linguistic disparities. Dig deeper into the data similarity analysis presented to explain this counterintuitive finding. 

8. How does the proposed method account for variations across different models and datasets? Explain its robustness advantages over methods relying solely on linguistic resources.

9. What are some promising ways the proposed FIM language similarity framework could be applied to other multilingual NLP tasks beyond machine translation?

10. What do you see as the main limitations of the current study? Outline 1-2 concrete follow-up experiments you would run to further validate and improve upon the method.
