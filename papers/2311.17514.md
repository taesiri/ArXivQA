# [Reinforcement Replaces Supervision: Query focused Summarization using   Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17514)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an approach for query-focused summarization (QFS) using reinforcement learning (RL). The authors develop multiple policy gradient networks trained with various reward signals including ROUGE, BLEU and semantic similarity. They also propose a novel passage embedding scheme to generate better semantic similarity rewards, trained using the cluster hypothesis. Their approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art supervised learning methods on the ELI5 dataset, including a 10-point increase on ROUGE-L. To facilitate further QFS research, they contribute a high-quality test set of 250 instances covering 13 domains, as well as a new 8 million instance dataset for passage embedding training. The RL approach demonstrates stronger query relevance over baselines, justifying the performance gains. Through analysis, they find their RL models learn to effectively summarize based on the query while avoiding hallucination issues faced by supervised models. Overall, this work makes multiple strong contributions in RL-based abstractive QFS and evaluation resources that will enable future progress in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents reinforcement learning models for query-focused summarization that outperform supervised learning methods, enabled by a novel passage embedding reward and resolving the conflict of using RL with teacher forcing in transformers, along with new datasets to facilitate research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) An RL algorithm that resolves the conflict of RL-based training in Transformers with Teacher Forcing. This allows effective incorporation of RL for text generation.

2) A human-curated test set of 250 high-quality instances for evaluating QfS models, covering 13 domains and devoid of topic centralization. 

3) A passage embedding based novel reward mechanism to score generated summaries, trained using the Cluster Hypothesis. This leads to better results than competing passage embedders.

4) A new dataset of ~8 million instances scraped from Reddit to train passage embedding models.

In summary, the key contributions are in developing an effective RL framework for abstractive QfS, contributing evaluation benchmarks, and proposing improvements like the passage embedding based reward.

The paper focuses on using reinforcement learning to train models for the task of query-focused summarization. It talks about using policy gradient methods and designing appropriate reward functions. The key ideas explored are using RL as a generalization of supervised learning, resolving conflicts with teacher forcing in transformers, and leveraging passage embeddings and cluster hypothesis. New datasets are also introduced. So these terms broadly capture the key concepts and contributions discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions resolving the conflict of employing RL in Transformers with Teacher Forcing. Can you explain in more detail how Scheduled Sampling is used to enable backpropagation while still performing sequential action sampling? 

2. The passage embedding model is trained using the Cluster Hypothesis. What is the intuition behind using this hypothesis for obtaining passage vectors? How does it help in providing better semantic similarity estimates?

3. The paper contributes two new datasets - RPEDT and RQFT. What are the key differences in the characteristics of these datasets? What purpose does each dataset serve?

4. Multiple policy gradient networks are trained using different reward signals like ROUGE, BLEU and semantic similarity. What are the relative trade-offs in using each of these rewards? Which one works best and why?

5. The paper shows significant quantitative gains from using RL models over supervised learning, especially on the RQFT dataset. What qualitative differences can be observed in the summaries generated by RL versus SL models?

6. When using a random irrelevant document instead of the actual document, why do the ROUGE scores for the SL model not change much while the RL models show a bigger drop? What does this indicate about how the models learn?

7. How many domains are covered in the RQFT dataset? What strategies were used to ensure absence of topic centralization while curating RQFT? 

8. What modifications were made to the architecture of BART in order to handle the longer input and output lengths for the QFS task?

9. The RL models seem to produce more verbose summaries compared to SL. Is this a strength or weakness? How can this characteristic be controlled?

10. For the passage embedding model, why is the BERT-large model better than BERT-base when evaluated on the downstream QFS task performance? What factors contribute to this difference?
