# [Training dynamics in Physics-Informed Neural Networks with feature   mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are an important machine learning approach for solving differential equations (DEs) based on physics principles. However, PINNs face challenges like difficulty converging to accurate solutions ("failure modes").
- Feature mapping is a technique from neural representation learning that has shown promise for improving convergence, but has been little studied in the PINNs literature. Prior work has limitations like relying solely on Fourier features, which can cause artifacts. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors investigate PINNs with feature mapping through the lens of two kernels that characterize training dynamics: the Conjugate Kernel (CK) and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).
- They show theoretically that the feature layer impacts these kernels and downstream propagation through the network. The kernels depend on properties like feature gradient and variance.
- They propose using conditional positive definite radial basis functions (RBFs) as the feature mapping, which can improve convergence. The RBF features have useful mathematical properties over Fourier features.

Main Contributions:
- Provides theory analyzing how feature layers impact PINN training dynamics via the CK/NTK kernels. Reveals limitations of common Fourier features.
- Proposes RBF feature mapping for PINNs and shows it outperforms alternatives across various DEs. Framework for designing effective feature mappings. 
- Simple method that could benefit many PINN models and training strategies. Advances understanding of how techniques from neural representation learning can aid PINNs.

In summary, the paper offers useful theoretical and empirical evidence for how feature mapping can improve PINN training, proposes RBF features as a robust approach, and provides a general framework to design features tailored for PINNs.
