# [PE-Planner: A Performance-Enhanced Quadrotor Motion Planner for   Autonomous Flight in Complex and Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12865)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a performance-enhanced quadrotor motion planner (PE-Planner) for autonomous flight in complex and dynamic environments. The goal is to enhance the speed, safety, and disturbance rejection capability compared to existing motion planners. The problems with existing motion planners are that they either focus on trajectory planning in complex static environments or trajectory tracking for agile flight in simple environments, but not both simultaneously. Also, they do not explicitly handle dynamic obstacles or external disturbances like wind.

The proposed solution is a motion planner that integrates both planning and control methods. It consists of a global planner that generates an initial trajectory using kinodynamic path searching and B-spline trajectory optimization. The locally optimal trajectory from the global planner is then tracked by a model predictive contouring control (MPCC) based local planner that takes into account quadrotor dynamics, estimated disturbances, control and time costs, and safety constraints. Key features include:

- Control barrier functions (CBFs) to ensure safety with both static and dynamic obstacles 

- A generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO) to estimate external disturbances and correct model predictions in the local planner

- Approximate arc length parameterization of reference trajectory to avoid need for reparameterization in MPCC

The main contributions are:

1) A quadrotor motion planner that greatly enhances speed, safety and robustness compared to prior works, enabling autonomous flight in complex dynamic environments

2) Incorporation of CBFs and disturbance observer into MPCC framework to explicitly handle dynamic obstacles and disturbances 

3) Integrated planning and control formulation interpreting MPCC's capabilities and approach to enhance planning, control and state estimation 

4) Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validating the proposed planner, including flights up to 6.8 m/s while ensuring safety

In summary, this paper presents a high-performance quadrotor motion planner using an integrated planning and control approach that pushes the limits of speed and complexity in autonomous drone flight while ensuring safety and robustness. The innovations in planning, control and state estimation techniques are key to unlocking the next level of aerial autonomy performance.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel quadrotor motion planner that integrates planning and control methods to significantly enhance the speed, safety, and robustness of autonomous flight in complex and dynamic environments. 

2) Incorporating both control barrier function and disturbance observer techniques into model predictive contouring control framework to handle dynamic obstacles and strong external disturbances, which has not been done before. This control-oriented design demonstrates the potential of MPCC for integrating planning and control.

3) Conducting extensive experiments in both simulations and real-world scenarios to validate the enhanced performance of the proposed motion planner in terms of speed, safety, and robustness against disturbances. The experiments showcase flights at high speeds up to 6.8 m/s with a 370g payload in a challenging environment.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a high-performance quadrotor motion planner that unifies planning and control, handles complex environments, and demonstrates enhanced speed, safety and robustness.
