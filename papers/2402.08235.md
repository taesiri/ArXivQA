# [Color Image Denoising Using The Green Channel Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Color Image Denoising Using The Green Channel Prior":

Problem:
- Noise removal in RGB color images is challenging as noise statistics can differ across R, G, B channels. 
- The green channel usually has higher sampling rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than red/blue in raw sensor data.
- However, the green channel prior (GCP) is often ignored in color image denoising methods which focus on modeling relationships between patches.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a GCP-based image denoising (GCP-ID) method to exploit the GCP for denoising color images in standard RGB space.
- Integrate GCP into classic nonlocal transform domain denoising framework.

Key Steps:
1) Use green channel to guide search for similar patches, improving search quality and transform domain sparsity.
2) Reformulate RGB patches into RGGB arrays to characterize density of green samples based on Bayer pattern.
3) Use block circulant representation to capture cross-channel correlation and redundancy. 
4) Apply tensor-SVD along third mode to leverage patch-level redundancy and spectral correlation.

Main Contributions:
- Novel way to explicitly utilize GCP to guide denoising of color images in standard RGB space.
- RGGB representation of patches to model density and importance of green channel.
- Block circulant representation to capture spectral correlation across channels.
- Integration of above ideas into a unified framework via nonlocal tensor-SVD transform.
- Demonstrate competitive performance on color image and video denoising tasks.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach to exploit the green channel prior for effective color image denoising by using guided patch search, RGGB patch representation and nonlocal tensor-SVD transform within a single framework.
