# [Federated Learning in Wireless Networks via Over-the-Air Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In federated learning, multiple agents (devices) collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their local private data sets. This improves privacy and communication efficiency compared to centralized learning.
- However, as the number of agents grows, sharing model parameter updates between agents and central server becomes communication-intensive. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use "over-the-air computation" where agents transmit parameters simultaneously in same frequency band. This exploits wireless interference instead of avoiding it.
- Received signal at central server is a weighted sum of transmitted signals. Proposed FedCOTA algorithm works with unknown, time-varying channel coefficients.
- Does not require reconstructing channel coefficients like prior work, improving efficiency and privacy.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes communication-efficient federated learning algorithm using over-the-air computation with time-varying unknown channel coefficients.
- Analyzes convergence by considering decreasing step sizes - shows expected squared error between parameter vector and optimal converges to small value.
- Evaluates FedCOTA on distributed logistic regression task - achieves 5x speedup compared to FedAvg with TDMA communication.
- Provides rigorous convergence analysis without needing to reconstruct channel coefficients, unlike related prior work. Improves efficiency and privacy.

In summary, the paper introduces FedCOTA, a novel federated learning algorithm using over-the-air computation that provides better efficiency and privacy compared to existing approaches. Convergence is formally analyzed and algorithm evaluated on logistic regression task.
