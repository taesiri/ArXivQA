# [AbsInstruct: Eliciting Abstraction Ability from LLMs through Explanation   Tuning with Plausibility Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Abstraction ability is important for human intelligence and can benefit various NLP tasks, but large language models (LLMs) still lack sufficient abstraction ability. 
- Prior work shows LLMs make mistakes in determining validity of abstract concepts. 
- How to improve abstraction ability of LLMs remains unexplored. Simply gathering more instructions has limited efficacy.

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose \papertitle framework to enhance LLMs' abstraction ability via explanation tuning.
- Build instructions with detailed explanation traces to provide underlying reasoning when detecting abstract concepts.  
- Introduce plausibility estimator to select instructions more consistent with LLM's pre-trained knowledge for better elicitation.
- Apply various filters to ensure quality and diversity.
- Construct hybrid dataset combining abstraction instructions with general instructions.

Main Contributions:
- First framework aimed at eliciting stronger abstraction abilities from LLMs.
- Show explanation traces and plausibility estimation effectively guide LLM to learn abstraction detection.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate framework can unlock abstraction ability with 6-10% performance boost.  
- Analyses exhibit strong generalization ability to other abstraction tasks while maintaining general capabilities.
- Framework is model-agnostic and could be applied to various LLMs.
- Provides new insights into enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel explanation tuning framework to address LLMs' deficiency in abstraction ability. Both automatic and human evaluations manifest the framework's efficacy in eliciting knowledge and aligning with human values.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called AbsInstruct that enhances large language models' ability to perform abstraction tasks by tuning them with explanations and selected instructions consistent with the models' existing knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called AbsInstruct to elicit stronger abstraction abilities from large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) The AbsInstruct framework builds instructions with detailed explanation traces to help LLMs better comprehend the underlying reasoning process for determining the validity of abstract concepts. 

2) It introduces a plausibility estimator to select instruction examples that are more consistent with the abstraction knowledge already present in the pre-trained LLM being aligned. This helps better elicit the LLM's existing knowledge.

3) It combines the abstraction instructions with general domain instructions (from Alpaca dataset) to build a hybrid dataset for fine-tuning the LLM. 

4) Extensive experiments show AbsInstruct can substantially enhance LLMs' abstraction abilities while maintaining their general instruction-following capabilities. For example, it improves the Macro F1 score of Mistral (7B) on the Abspyramid benchmark by over 10 points compared to other methods.

In summary, the key contribution is designing an effective framework to unlock stronger abstraction abilities in LLMs via explanation-based instruction tuning and careful data selection.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Abstraction ability - The paper focuses on eliciting and enhancing the abstraction ability of large language models (LLMs). This refers to the ability to identify shared traits among items to build broader, more general concepts.

- Explanation traces - The proposed framework, AbsInstruct, collects detailed explanation traces that provide the underlying reasoning for determining the validity of abstract concepts. This is meant to help LLMs better comprehend abstraction. 

- Plausibility estimation - AbsInstruct introduces a plausibility estimator to select instruction data that is more consistent with the existing abstraction knowledge of the LLM being aligned. This helps better elicit the LLM's knowledge.

- Instruction tuning - The overall goal is tuning/aligning LLMs through instruction data to enhance their skills, specifically abstraction ability in this case.

- Entailment relations - The paper looks at three types of relations centered around abstraction: noun-entail, verb-entail, and event-entail.

- Generalization performance - Evaluations demonstrate AbsInstruct can improve abstraction ability with strong generalization performance.

- Maintaining capabilities - Analyses show alignment for abstraction does not compromise LLMs' performance at general instruction following.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a plausibility estimator to select instruction examples that match the language model's knowledge. How exactly is the plausibility score computed? What are the strengths and weaknesses of using perplexity as the plausibility measure?

2. The paper collects detailed explanation traces to provide rationales for predicting concept validity. What are some challenges in generating high-quality explanations automatically? How might the quality of explanations impact overall performance?  

3. The paper combines abstraction instructions with general domain instructions from Alpaca. What is the rationale behind this hybrid approach? What are some ways the mixing ratio can be optimized?

4. The paper demonstrates improved generalization ability on out-of-domain datasets after applying the proposed method. What factors contribute to the better generalization? How might the framework be extended to improve generalization further?

5. The prompts designed for collecting explanations seem to play an important role. What makes an effective prompt for collecting high-quality explanations? What guidelines should be followed when designing such prompts?

6. Error analysis reveals that models sometimes make wrong predictions despite correct explanations. What could be the potential reasons behind this? How can this issue be addressed?

7. Could the proposed method be applied to other tasks requiring reasoning, abstraction or common sense? What adaptations would be needed to generalize the approach?

8. The paper relies on an additional model (GPT4) for generating explanations. How sensitive is overall performance to the choice of explanation generator model?  

9. Aside from perplexity, what other signals could the plausibility estimator leverage to select more suitable instruction examples? How can multiple plausibility signals be combined?

10. How do the improved abstraction abilities demonstrated on Abspyramid and out-of-domain datasets translate to performance on downstream tasks? What further evaluations could be done?
