# [AbsInstruct: Eliciting Abstraction Ability from LLMs through Explanation   Tuning with Plausibility Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Abstraction ability is important for human intelligence and can benefit various NLP tasks, but large language models (LLMs) still lack sufficient abstraction ability. 
- Prior work shows LLMs make mistakes in determining validity of abstract concepts. 
- How to improve abstraction ability of LLMs remains unexplored. Simply gathering more instructions has limited efficacy.

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose \papertitle framework to enhance LLMs' abstraction ability via explanation tuning.
- Build instructions with detailed explanation traces to provide underlying reasoning when detecting abstract concepts.  
- Introduce plausibility estimator to select instructions more consistent with LLM's pre-trained knowledge for better elicitation.
- Apply various filters to ensure quality and diversity.
- Construct hybrid dataset combining abstraction instructions with general instructions.

Main Contributions:
- First framework aimed at eliciting stronger abstraction abilities from LLMs.
- Show explanation traces and plausibility estimation effectively guide LLM to learn abstraction detection.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate framework can unlock abstraction ability with 6-10% performance boost.  
- Analyses exhibit strong generalization ability to other abstraction tasks while maintaining general capabilities.
- Framework is model-agnostic and could be applied to various LLMs.
- Provides new insights into enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel explanation tuning framework to address LLMs' deficiency in abstraction ability. Both automatic and human evaluations manifest the framework's efficacy in eliciting knowledge and aligning with human values.
