# [Robust Emotion Recognition in Context Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Robust Emotion Recognition in Context Debiasing":

Problem:
- Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) uses contextual information to recognize emotions when facial/bodily cues are ambiguous. 
- However, CAER models rely on spurious correlations between contexts and emotion labels, leading to context bias. This causes poor generalization.
- Existing debiasing efforts fail to decouple the good prior and bad bias in context semantics. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a CounterfactuaL Emotion inFerence (CLEF) framework to mitigate context bias.
- CLEF formulates a causal graph to reveal causal relationships in CAER - context bias causes a direct adverse effect along the context branch.
- CLEF captures this using a non-invasive context branch during training.  
- During inference, CLEF compares the factual (normal CAER model) and counterfactual (only context branch) outcomes. By subtracting the counterfactual outcome, the direct context bias effect is eliminated.

Main Contributions:
- First to utilize counterfactual thinking to investigate causality and reveal that context bias misleads models via direct causal effect.
- CLEF disentangles and mitigates context bias in a model-agnostic manner through counterfactual inference.
- Extensive experiments show CLEF consistently improves multiple CAER methods and outperforms prior debiasing efforts.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel counterfactual inference framework called CLEF to reveal and mitigate the effect of context bias in CAER models by comparing factual and counterfactual outcomes. Experiments demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
