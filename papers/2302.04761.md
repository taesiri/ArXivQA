# [Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can language models learn to effectively use external tools like search engines, calculators, etc. in a self-supervised way, without requiring a lot of human annotation or being limited to task-specific contexts?The key hypothesis seems to be that by sampling and filtering API calls based on whether they reduce perplexity, language models can learn when and how to leverage different tools to improve their performance on various tasks. The authors aim to show that this approach allows models to gain useful skills and knowledge while retaining their core language modeling abilities.In summary, the main research question is whether language models can teach themselves to use tools in a general way, without losing their generality as language models. The hypothesis is that the proposed self-supervised method based on perplexity reduction will allow models to learn effective tool use skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting Toolformer, a language model that can teach itself to use external tools like calculators, search engines, and calendars via simple APIs. The key ideas are:- Toolformer learns when and how to use tools in a self-supervised way, without requiring a lot of human annotations. It decides for itself when to call APIs and which arguments to pass based on whether it helps predict the next tokens.- Toolformer is trained on the same dataset used to pretrain the base language model, so it retains the model's generality and language modeling abilities. - Experiments show Toolformer substantially improves zero-shot performance on various downstream tasks like math, QA, and temporal reasoning, often outperforming much larger models.So in summary, the main contribution is enabling language models to autonomously learn to leverage external tools via APIs in a self-supervised way, which provides large gains on downstream tasks without losing generality. The approach is general and could incorporate many different tools.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces Toolformer, a language model that learns in a self-supervised way to decide when and how to make API calls to external tools like search engines and calculators in order to improve its performance on downstream tasks, without losing its core language modeling abilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key things to note about how this paper compares to related work on teaching language models to use tools:- The approach is self-supervised and does not rely on large amounts of human annotations. This sets it apart from prior work like Internet-Augmented Language Models (Komeili et al., 2022) and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022) which require substantial human supervision.- Tool use is learned in a general way, allowing the model to decide for itself when and how to leverage different tools. Other approaches like PAL (Gao et al., 2022) and TALM (Parisi et al., 2022) explore tool use in more task-specific settings.- The tools considered cover a diverse set of capabilities including question answering, search, translation, calendars, and calculators. Many prior works focus on just one or two tools like search engines or calculators. - Experiments demonstrate improved zero-shot performance on a variety of downstream tasks without sacrificing language modeling ability. This shows the approach enables more comprehensive tool use compared to task-specific methods.- The approach is applied to a 6.7B parameter model and shown to outperform even much larger 175B models on some tasks. This suggests it can make smaller models more capable through tool use.- Analysis explores how tool use changes with model size, showing benefits emerge around 775M parameters but gaps remain even at 6.7B parameters. This provides useful insights on scaling laws.Overall, the self-supervised nature of the approach, generality in learning tool use, diversity of tools considered, zero-shot downstream evaluations, and analysis around model scaling help differentiate this work and advance research on empowering LMs through external tools.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Enabling the language model to use tools in a chain, where the output of one tool is used as the input to another tool. The current approach trains each tool independently.- Allowing the language model to interact with tools like search engines in a more dynamic way, such as reformulating queries or browsing through multiple results. This could improve performance on tasks like question answering. - Making the model less sensitive to the exact wording of the prompt when deciding whether to invoke a tool.- Increasing sample efficiency, as the current approach requires a lot of data to learn when to invoke some tools like the calculator. The authors suggest iteratively applying their approach could help with this.- Incorporating the computational cost of invoking different tools into the model's decisions about when to use them.- Overall, enabling more sophisticated and dynamic interactions between the language model and external tools is identified as an exciting direction for future work. The authors' approach provides a strong foundation, but there are opportunities to make tool use even more flexible, interactive, and efficient.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Toolformer, a novel approach that teaches language models to autonomously decide when and how to leverage different external tools via simple APIs. The key idea is to exploit in-context learning to generate a large dataset of potential API calls, execute these calls, and then filter out those that do not help reduce perplexity. The remaining useful API calls are merged back into the original text to create an augmented dataset for finetuning the language model. Experiments demonstrate that a 6.7B parameter GPT-J model finetuned this way, called Toolformer, achieves substantially improved zero-shot performance on a variety of downstream tasks compared to the original GPT-J baseline. For instance, on LAMA question answering, math reasoning benchmarks like SVAMP, and the multilingual MLQA dataset, Toolformer clearly outperforms a 175B parameter GPT-3 model. At the same time, finetuning with tools comes at no cost to core language modeling performance. The approach is shown to work for tools like search engines, calculators, question answering systems, calendars, and translators. Overall, the paper presents a novel self-supervised method for teaching language models to leverage external knowledge sources without losing generality or requiring task-specific human annotations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Toolformer, a language model that learns to use external tools like calculators, search engines, and calendars via simple APIs. The key innovation is that Toolformer learns when and how to use these tools in a completely self-supervised manner, without any human annotations. This is done by first generating a large number of potential API calls using the language model's own predictions. These are then filtered to only keep API calls that actually help the model predict future tokens, as measured by a reduction in perplexity. The language model is then finetuned on text augmented with these helpful API calls. Experiments demonstrate that this approach enables Toolformer, a 6.7B parameter model, to substantially outperform the much larger 175B parameter GPT-3 on several downstream tasks. For example, on math tasks Toolformer achieves over 2x higher accuracy by using a calculator. The benefits are zero-shot and do not come at the cost of degraded language modeling performance.In summary, this paper presents a novel self-supervised approach for teaching language models to make use of external tools via APIs. By learning for themselves when tools are helpful, the models can acquire new skills like mathematical reasoning and fact lookup that improve zero-shot performance. The approach maintains language modeling abilities and generality while enabling models to overcome certain limitations. The results demonstrate the promise of self-supervised tool use in language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a summary of the main method in one paragraph:The paper introduces Toolformer, a language model that learns to use external tools via simple APIs in a self-supervised way. The approach involves first generating a large number of potential API calls for tools like search engines and calculators by exploiting the in-context learning ability of large LMs. These API calls are executed to get responses and then filtered based on whether they help reduce perplexity over future tokens. The API calls that pass this filtering criterion are merged with the original text to create an augmented dataset which is used to finetune the LM. Through this simple method of generating API calls, executing them, filtering the useful ones based on the LM's own feedback, and finetuning the LM on the augmented data, Toolformer learns when and how to leverage different tools without any human supervision. After this training process, the model is able to make better zero-shot predictions by calling tools such as question answering systems and calculators when needed.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:- Language models (LMs) like GPT-3 exhibit remarkable few-shot learning abilities but have limitations in basic skills like arithmetic, factual lookup, and keeping track of time.- Existing approaches for equipping LMs with external tools rely heavily on human supervision or are limited to task-specific contexts. - The authors propose a new method called Toolformer that allows LMs to learn to use tools like calculators, search engines, and calendars via simple APIs in a self-supervised way without losing generative capabilities.- Toolformer learns when and how to leverage different tools by generating many tool usage examples and keeping those that reduce perplexity. It can then decide for itself when to use which tools.- The main questions are: Can LMs learn to effectively use tools without losing generality? Can they learn when and how to use different tools just from self-supervision? How does tool usage affect downstream task performance and scaling?In summary, the key problem is overcoming the limitations of LMs by giving them the ability to use tools in a flexible self-supervised way, without sacrificing generative abilities or task generality. The main questions surround whether and how well LMs can learn tool usage via the proposed approach.
