# Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can language models learn to effectively use external tools like search engines, calculators, etc. in a self-supervised way, without requiring a lot of human annotation or being limited to task-specific contexts?The key hypothesis seems to be that by sampling and filtering API calls based on whether they reduce perplexity, language models can learn when and how to leverage different tools to improve their performance on various tasks. The authors aim to show that this approach allows models to gain useful skills and knowledge while retaining their core language modeling abilities.In summary, the main research question is whether language models can teach themselves to use tools in a general way, without losing their generality as language models. The hypothesis is that the proposed self-supervised method based on perplexity reduction will allow models to learn effective tool use skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting Toolformer, a language model that can teach itself to use external tools like calculators, search engines, and calendars via simple APIs. The key ideas are:- Toolformer learns when and how to use tools in a self-supervised way, without requiring a lot of human annotations. It decides for itself when to call APIs and which arguments to pass based on whether it helps predict the next tokens.- Toolformer is trained on the same dataset used to pretrain the base language model, so it retains the model's generality and language modeling abilities. - Experiments show Toolformer substantially improves zero-shot performance on various downstream tasks like math, QA, and temporal reasoning, often outperforming much larger models.So in summary, the main contribution is enabling language models to autonomously learn to leverage external tools via APIs in a self-supervised way, which provides large gains on downstream tasks without losing generality. The approach is general and could incorporate many different tools.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces Toolformer, a language model that learns in a self-supervised way to decide when and how to make API calls to external tools like search engines and calculators in order to improve its performance on downstream tasks, without losing its core language modeling abilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key things to note about how this paper compares to related work on teaching language models to use tools:- The approach is self-supervised and does not rely on large amounts of human annotations. This sets it apart from prior work like Internet-Augmented Language Models (Komeili et al., 2022) and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022) which require substantial human supervision.- Tool use is learned in a general way, allowing the model to decide for itself when and how to leverage different tools. Other approaches like PAL (Gao et al., 2022) and TALM (Parisi et al., 2022) explore tool use in more task-specific settings.- The tools considered cover a diverse set of capabilities including question answering, search, translation, calendars, and calculators. Many prior works focus on just one or two tools like search engines or calculators. - Experiments demonstrate improved zero-shot performance on a variety of downstream tasks without sacrificing language modeling ability. This shows the approach enables more comprehensive tool use compared to task-specific methods.- The approach is applied to a 6.7B parameter model and shown to outperform even much larger 175B models on some tasks. This suggests it can make smaller models more capable through tool use.- Analysis explores how tool use changes with model size, showing benefits emerge around 775M parameters but gaps remain even at 6.7B parameters. This provides useful insights on scaling laws.Overall, the self-supervised nature of the approach, generality in learning tool use, diversity of tools considered, zero-shot downstream evaluations, and analysis around model scaling help differentiate this work and advance research on empowering LMs through external tools.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Enabling the language model to use tools in a chain, where the output of one tool is used as the input to another tool. The current approach trains each tool independently.- Allowing the language model to interact with tools like search engines in a more dynamic way, such as reformulating queries or browsing through multiple results. This could improve performance on tasks like question answering. - Making the model less sensitive to the exact wording of the prompt when deciding whether to invoke a tool.- Increasing sample efficiency, as the current approach requires a lot of data to learn when to invoke some tools like the calculator. The authors suggest iteratively applying their approach could help with this.- Incorporating the computational cost of invoking different tools into the model's decisions about when to use them.- Overall, enabling more sophisticated and dynamic interactions between the language model and external tools is identified as an exciting direction for future work. The authors' approach provides a strong foundation, but there are opportunities to make tool use even more flexible, interactive, and efficient.
