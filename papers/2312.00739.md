# [Adversarial Score Distillation: When score distillation meets GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00739)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Adversarial Score Distillation (ASD), a new score distillation method for 2D and 3D generation tasks. It traces the origin of existing methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and connects them to the framework of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN). The authors identify issues with fixed or incomplete discriminator optimization in SDS and other methods, which leads to instability and over-smoothing/saturation. ASD employs a complete WGAN discriminator loss to optimize an embeddable discriminator parameter, improving quality and stability. Experiments demonstrate ASD's strong performance on 2D image generation, text-to-3D generation, and image editing against existing methods. ASD stabilizes optimization, recovers from over-saturation, and produces high quality and diverse results. The connection to WGAN also allows extending powerful diffusion models to new tasks by designing appropriate GAN paradigms.
