# [Machine Learning based Prediction of Ditching Loads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ditching refers to emergency aircraft landing on water. Accurately predicting resulting dynamic loads on the aircraft fuselage is important for structural integrity analysis and occupant safety. 
- Traditional model-scale experiments have limitations in properly capturing complex multi-phase flow effects during ditching. Using high-fidelity CFD simulations for load prediction is computationally expensive.
- The goal is to develop efficient data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches to predict spatio-temporal evolution of ditching loads on the fuselage.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper investigates convolutional autoencoder (CAE) based models to reconstruct and predict ditching loads from simulation data.
- The overall strategy has two steps - (1) Reduce data dimension using a CAE while retaining spatial dependencies (2) Model temporal evolution of reduced data using either LSTM networks or Koopman operator based approaches.
- Four model variants are studied - Convolutional joint model (CJM), CJM with deep decoder (CJMDD), CJM with non-local blocks (CJMNLB) and Koopman autoencoder (KAE). All models are trained end-to-end.

Data: 
- Ditching simulation data for a DLR-D150 aircraft fuselage is obtained using an enhanced momentum theory based method. Discretization uses 150 x 171 grid points. 
- 323 simulations with different impact conditions are used to create a dataset of 8510 time-step images for training and validation.

Results:
- All four models show satisfactory predictive capability for the test cases, with CJMDD providing lowest errors. LSTM with deep decoder performs better than directly reconstructing full data.
- Peak load timing prediction is most accurate for CJMDD and KAE. Oscillations are observed in CJM and CJMNLB predictions.
- Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of using CAE-LSTM networks as efficient surrogates for ditching load prediction.

Main Contributions:
- First known application of machine learning to predict aircraft fuselage ditching loads.
- Assessment of multiple CAE-based model variants for spatio-temporal load prediction.
- Analysis of predictive accuracy for both spatial and temporal load evolution.
- Demonstration of feasibility to use ML surrogates for two-way fluid-structure coupling.
