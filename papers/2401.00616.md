# [GD^2-NeRF: Generative Detail Compensation via GAN and Diffusion for   One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the task of one-shot novel view synthesis (O-NVS), which aims to synthesize photo-realistic novel views of a scene given only a single reference image. Existing one-shot generalizable neural radiance fields (OG-NeRF) methods for this task suffer from blurry outputs due to their reliance on limited information from the reference image. Recent diffusion-based image-to-3d methods can generate more vivid results but require tedious per-scene optimization.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes GD2-NeRF, a coarse-to-fine generative detail compensation framework for O-NVS. It is composed of:

1) OPP: A coarse-stage method that efficiently integrates a GAN model into existing OG-NeRF pipeline using a parallel framework. This captures in-distribution detail priors to relieve blurriness.

2) Diff3DE: A fine-stage method that incorporates detail priors from pre-trained diffusion models into a 3D-consistent enhancer without per-scene optimization. This further enhances details.

Together, GD2-NeRF hierarchically compensates for details to generate vivid, plausible novel views without test-time optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes OPP method to effectively insert GAN model into OG-NeRF pipeline to improve sharpness while maintaining fidelity

- Makes early attempt to directly use pre-trained diffusion model as 3D-consistent detail enhancer without any finetuning

- Achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis quality with inference-time finetuning-free and vivid plausible details

In summary, the paper explores a generative compensation perspective to address limitations of existing OG-NeRF methods for one-shot novel view synthesis. The proposed GD2-NeRF framework generates high-quality novel views without need for optimization at test time.
