# [Think Before You Act: Unified Policy for Interleaving Language Reasoning   with Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11063)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we train an agent to interleave language reasoning with actions in order to leverage textual descriptions like captions from offline training data? 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposing a method to unify actions and textual captions into a joint sequence during data processing. This allows training a model that can predict both actions and text.

- Presenting an auto-regressive transformer architecture that can generate both actions and text captions. At test time, the model interleaves reasoning captions with actions. 

- Evaluating the approach on BabyAI and showing that leveraging textual captions along with actions improves performance compared to just using actions, especially on complex tasks requiring planning.

So in summary, the main goal is to develop a policy that can leverage textual captions from offline datasets to improve its ability to plan and reason, by interleaving language generation with actions. The key hypothesis is that reasoning via text will lead to better generalization and sample efficiency compared to just using actions. The BabyAI experiments provide evidence for this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to train an agent that can interleave language reasoning with performing actions in an environment. Specifically:

- They propose an algorithm to generate text-augmented expert trajectories for the BabyAI environment, which serves as a toy environment to emulate tutorial videos with captions. 

- They present an auto-regressive transformer architecture that can be trained to predict both actions and text captions in a unified way on the generated trajectories. 

- They show that their model, which leverages the textual captions during training, outperforms a caption-free baseline that only sees actions and observations. The improvement is especially significant on tasks that require long-term sequential planning.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel method to unify language reasoning with actions in a single policy, by training a model that can generate both captions and actions. The results demonstrate the benefit of leveraging subgoal descriptions from offline datasets for improving policy learning and generalization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to train a transformer policy to interleave language reasoning with actions by augmenting it with word outputs, and shows this consistently improves performance over a baseline without reasoning on challenging sequential tasks in BabyAI that require long-term planning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The paper proposes a novel method for training a policy to interleave language reasoning with taking actions, in order to leverage textual descriptions like captions available in offline training data. This allows the policy to decide when to perform explicit language-based reasoning versus just acting. This idea of unifying language and actions in a single policy seems quite unique compared to prior work.

- Most prior work on leveraging language for offline RL has focused on using language to define reward functions or pre-train parts of the model. For example, some papers looked at aligning language and observations for reward learning. This paper takes a more direct approach by training the policy model to generate both actions and words.

- The idea of auto-regressive transformers for RL has been explored in prior work like Decision Transformer, but this paper augments it to also generate text. The unified action-language modelling is novel.

- Using BabyAI as a testbed is a nice controlled setup, compared to more complex environments like MineCraft that other offline RL papers have used. The BabyAI tasks seem very well-suited to study the impact of language subgoal reasoning.

- The results demonstrate clear benefits on complex tasks requiring planning and long-term reasoning. This shows the promise of leveraging language to aid in learning policies, compared to just using actions and observations.

Overall, the unified policy approach and results on BabyAI highlight the usefulness of language for offline RL, in a novel way compared to prior work. Testing the method on large real-world datasets could be an interesting direction for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Testing the method on more complex environments like Minecraft using large-scale datasets like MineDojo that contain video captions. The BabyAI environment in this paper is relatively simple, so applying the approach to more complex 3D environments like Minecraft is an important next step.

- Extending the language reasoning capabilities beyond just subgoal generation. In this work, the language tokens generated by the model correspond to subgoals. But the same mechanism could support other types of reasoning like common sense reasoning, making inferences, etc. Exploring what other types of reasoning can be incorporated is an interesting direction.

- Studying whether language reasoning can improve sample efficiency and stability when combined with online RL training. One hypothesis is that language reasoning helps break down complex tasks into more manageable chunks, which could improve learning. Testing this hypothesis by combining the approach with online RL is another key direction.

- Scaling up the model architecture and training dataset size. The model in this paper is relatively small. Training larger models on even bigger datasets could lead to further improvements.

So in summary, the key future directions are applying the approach to more complex 3D environments, expanding the language reasoning capabilities, combining it with online RL training, and scaling up the models and datasets further. The authors lay out a promising research program for unifying language and decision making in RL.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method for training reinforcement learning agents to interleave language reasoning with taking actions in an environment. The key idea is to train a transformer policy model to output both actions and textual reasoning captions on offline expert demonstration data. Specifically, the policy model takes as input an instruction, previous observations/actions, and the current observation, and predicts either an action to take or a reasoning caption token auto-regressively. The model is trained on expert trajectories from the BabyAI environment that have been augmented with textual subgoal captions describing what the agent is trying to achieve. At test time, the policy can generate reasoning captions interleaved with actions towards satisfying the instruction goal. Experiments on BabyAI tasks show the model outperforms caption-free baselines, especially on complex tasks requiring long-term reasoning. The proposed method provides a way to leverage language annotations in offline RL data to improve policy learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to train an agent capable of interleaving language reasoning with performing actions in an environment. The key idea is to augment a transformer policy with word outputs so it can generate textual captions along with actions. This allows the policy to decide when to perform language-based reasoning versus taking actions. The authors train an auto-regressive transformer conditioned on instructions and observations to predict both actions and text captions from offline expert demonstrations. At test time, the model generates actions towards satisfying the instruction goal as well as reasoning captions. 

Experiments are conducted in the BabyAI environment using trajectories with ground-truth subgoal captions. The model outperforms caption-free baselines, especially on complex tasks requiring long-term reasoning like BossLevel. This shows the value of leveraging subgoal descriptions for learning policies. Overall, the proposed unified reasoning and acting policy presents a promising approach to incorporate language-based reasoning into reinforcement learning agents. The idea of interleaving reasoning and action has potential to improve training efficiency and performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method for training an agent to interleave language reasoning with taking actions in an environment. The key ideas are:

1) They generate a dataset of expert trajectories in the BabyAI environment, augmented with textual captions describing subgoals. This creates a toy dataset analogous to YouTube tutorial videos with captions. 

2) They train an auto-regressive transformer model on this dataset to predict both actions and caption tokens given the current observation. This allows the model to decide when to perform textual reasoning versus taking an action. 

3) At test time, the transformer can generate a sequence of textual reasoning tokens interleaved with actions towards satisfying the given instruction.

4) Experiments on BabyAI show the model with captions outperforms a baseline without captions, especially on complex tasks requiring long-term reasoning. This demonstrates the benefit of incorporating explicit language-based reasoning into the policy.
