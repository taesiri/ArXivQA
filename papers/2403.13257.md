# [Arcee's MergeKit: A Toolkit for Merging Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13257)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Arcee's MergeKit: A Toolkit for Merging Large Language Models":

Problem:
- There are many open-source large language models (LLMs) available, but they are typically specialized for certain tasks and cannot leverage strengths of other models. 
- Fine-tuning separate models for each task is costly and leads to models that cannot share insights across tasks. 
- Retraining models from scratch has high computational costs. Fine-tuning can also lead to catastrophic forgetting of original capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce MergeKit, an open-source library for efficiently merging multiple LLMs into a single unified model. 
- Merging combines strengths of multiple models without needing to retrain them. Enables multi-task learning without catastrophic forgetting.
- Supports various merging techniques like weight averaging, SLERP, TIES, etc. Has extensible architecture to add new techniques.
- Designed to scale across hardware configurations. Modular components for easy customization. Compatible with HuggingFace Transformers.

Main Contributions:
- Provide overview of model merging research and categorize merging techniques based on weight initializations and architectures.
- Introduce MergeKit - its objectives, architecture, efficiency optimizations, and community engagement. 
- Offer guidelines on extending MergeKit by adding new merging methods.
- Demonstrate MergeKit's rising popularity. 20% of top 50 models on Open LLM Leaderboard are merged models.
- Show example of improving medical QA model by merging with a conversational model using MergeKit.

In summary, MergeKit facilitates efficient merging of multiple specialized LLMs into unified models with combined strengths. Its open-source architecture enables continuous integration of latest research to push state-of-the-art in model merging.
