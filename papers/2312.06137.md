# [Compute-in-Memory based Neural Network Accelerators for Safety-Critical   Systems: Worst-Case Scenarios and Protections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06137)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper focuses on evaluating and enhancing the worst-case performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed on emerging non-volatile memory (NVM)-based compute-in-memory (CiM) accelerators, which are promising for edge devices due to their energy efficiency. The authors first formulate the problem of finding the minimum DNN accuracy amidst device variations in CiM architectures and propose an optimization framework called LWC to efficiently solve it. Through experiments on various DNNs, they demonstrate that even subtle randomized device variations can substantially degrade accuracy, underscoring risks in using CiM platforms to support safety-critical applications. The authors then evaluate existing methods aimed at improving average DNN performance under device variations and find them ineffective for boosting worst-case accuracy. To address this gap, they propose a novel training technique called A-TRICE that combines adversarial training to minimize worst-case loss with a specialized noise injection method. Experiments exhibit over 30% enhancement in worst-case accuracy using A-TRICE. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into assessing and bolstering reliability of CiM accelerators for mission-critical scenarios.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures using non-volatile memories (NVMs) are promising for accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs). However, NVMs suffer from device variations which can cause deviations of the programmed weights from targeted values, harming DNN accuracy.

- Most research focuses on improving average performance amidst device variations. However, worst-case performance is crucial for safety-critical applications but overlooked. Existing methods like Monte Carlo simulations or weight attack methods fail to efficiently identify the true worst-case scenario. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an optimization framework called LWC to efficiently find the weight perturbations leading to worst-case accuracy of a DNN, by formulating and relaxing the problem into a differentiable form.

- A fast approximation method called FLWC is also introduced, using fast gradient sign method to estimate worst-case accuracy. FLWC trades off between accuracy and efficiency.

- Since existing robustness enhancement methods are ineffective for worst-case performance, a new training technique called A-TRICE is proposed, combining adversarial training and noise injection training with right-censored Gaussian noise.

Contributions:  
- First to formulate the problem of finding worst-case DNN performance under device variations.
- Propose LWC method to accurately pinpoint worst-case accuracy scenarios.
- Show that even small deviations due to write-verify can still cause dramatic DNN accuracy drops. 
- Demonstrate ineffectiveness of existing methods in improving worst-case performance.
- Introduce FLWC for efficient worst-case estimation.
- Propose A-TRICE training to improve worst-case accuracy by up to 33%.

In summary, the paper addresses the overlooked but critical challenge of evaluating and enhancing DNN worst-case performance amidst device variations for reliable CiM hardware.
