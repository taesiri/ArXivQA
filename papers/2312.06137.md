# [Compute-in-Memory based Neural Network Accelerators for Safety-Critical   Systems: Worst-Case Scenarios and Protections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06137)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper focuses on evaluating and enhancing the worst-case performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed on emerging non-volatile memory (NVM)-based compute-in-memory (CiM) accelerators, which are promising for edge devices due to their energy efficiency. The authors first formulate the problem of finding the minimum DNN accuracy amidst device variations in CiM architectures and propose an optimization framework called LWC to efficiently solve it. Through experiments on various DNNs, they demonstrate that even subtle randomized device variations can substantially degrade accuracy, underscoring risks in using CiM platforms to support safety-critical applications. The authors then evaluate existing methods aimed at improving average DNN performance under device variations and find them ineffective for boosting worst-case accuracy. To address this gap, they propose a novel training technique called A-TRICE that combines adversarial training to minimize worst-case loss with a specialized noise injection method. Experiments exhibit over 30% enhancement in worst-case accuracy using A-TRICE. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into assessing and bolstering reliability of CiM accelerators for mission-critical scenarios.
