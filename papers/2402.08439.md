# [JeFaPaTo -- A joint toolbox for blinking analysis and facial features   extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Analyzing facial features and blinking behavior is important for medical applications, but requires precise computer vision techniques that are often inaccessible to medical experts without programming skills. 
- There is a need for user-friendly tools to help analyze high framerate video data of blinking in detail (duration, synchronicity, velocity, etc.) to understand conditions like facial paralysis.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces JeFaPaTo, a Python toolbox for joint analysis of blinking and facial features. 
- It uses mediapipe to extract facial landmarks and blend shapes from video, computes metrics like Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), detects blinks, matches left/right eyes, and calculates statistics.
- It provides both a programming API for processing data and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt6 and pyqtgraph for non-programmers. 
- The GUI enables loading data, visualizing summaries of blinking over time, manually correcting blink detection, exporting data, etc.

Main Contributions:
- Accessible toolbox bridging advanced CV techniques and medical analysis of high framerate facial video data
- Computing robust EAR scores for detailed blinking analysis using automatic matching of left/right eyes
- GUI for non-programmers to visualize summaries, manually refine blink detection, export data
- Set of medically relevant statistics like blink rates, EAR stats, delay between blinks, partial/complete blinks
- Standalone cross-platform executables for easy usage 
- Actively co-developed with medical experts to ensure utility and usability

In summary, JeFaPaTo enables detailed automated analysis of blinking behavior from video, packaged in an easy-to-use toolbox tailored for medical applications by both CV and medical experts. The interface and statistics bridge the gap between advanced CV and accessibility needed in medical settings.
