# [Genetic Algorithm for Constrained Molecular Inverse Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03518)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design a genetic algorithm that performs constrained optimization for molecular inverse design? Specifically, the authors aim to develop a genetic algorithm that can optimize desired molecular properties while adhering to structural constraints on the molecules. The key challenges are:1) Generating valid molecular structures through crossover and mutation operators in the genetic algorithm pipeline.2) Optimizing for target properties without failing to satisfy molecular substructure constraints. To address these challenges, the proposed method introduces:- A two-phase optimization procedure to first ensure constraint satisfaction in the population, and then perform bi-objective optimization on the property and constraint. - Use of graph and SELFIES descriptors to generate valid molecules through crossover and mutation respectively.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by using a two-phase GA pipeline and appropriate molecular descriptors, they can develop an algorithm for constrained optimization in molecular inverse design. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
