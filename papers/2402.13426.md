# [Explaining Relationships Among Research Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Keeping up with all the latest research publications is very time consuming, even with daily feed tools. Researchers need concise, customized literature reviews summarizing sets of new papers to help decide what to read.
- Prior work has focused on generating single citation sentences, ignoring relationships among multiple papers. They lack the expository and transition sentences needed to connect citations into a coherent story.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper explores a feature-based, LLM-prompting approach to generate richer citation texts and explain relationships among research papers.
- Key features are extracted from a local citation network and the target paper to capture paper content, relationships, and contextual information. These guide LLM prompting.
- A human-provided "main ideas" plan is used to guide overall organization. 

Contributions:
- Proposes interpretable features to capture paper relationships and guide LLM prompting to generate multiple integrated citation paragraphs.
- Conducts expert evaluation on generated literature review paragraphs.
- Finds human preference correlates with abstract, integrative writing style with transition sentences between citations.
- Concludes that accurately describing relationships among papers is key - simply concatenating paper summaries is not enough.

In summary, the paper demonstrates a feature-based approach to guiding LLMs to generate integrated paragraph-level literature reviews that richly explain relationships among research papers. Key findings show that transition sentences and abstract, high-level citations are preferred by human readers over detailed paper summaries.
