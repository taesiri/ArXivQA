# [Automated Assessment of Students' Code Comprehension using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Assessing students' natural language explanations, especially for programming concepts, is an important challenge in education. 
- Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT show promise for natural language tasks, but their potential for automated assessment of students' explanations has been underexplored. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores using LLMs to assess semantic similarity between students' line-by-line code explanations and expert reference explanations. 
- It compares LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-4) against encoder-based semantic textual similarity (STS) models like SBERT.
- Different prompting strategies are used with LLMs including baseline, few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

Key Findings:
- Fine-tuned SBERT models perform best overall for assessing code explanations.
- With CoT prompting, GPT-4 matches SBERT performance, showing LLMs can reach encoder models. 
- GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 significantly across prompting techniques.
- Providing similarity on 0-1 scale works better than 1-5 scale for LLMs.
- CoT prompting gives 15%+ boost over baseline prompting for LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- First study assessing LLMs for evaluating students' code explanations.
- Thorough comparison of multiple semantic similarity techniques. 
- Demonstrates promise of prompting strategies to improve LLM performance.
- Provides insights into effectively employing LLMs for assessment in education.

In summary, the paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of using modern LLMs for the important educational application of automatically assessing students' conceptual explanations. The findings reveal that prompted appropriately, LLMs can match traditional encoders, illustrating their potential for automated short answer grading.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores using Large Language Models like ChatGPT to automatically assess the correctness of students' short, open-ended explanations of computer code by comparing them to expert reference explanations, finding that prompting strategies can make LLMs perform as well as fine-tuned encoder models for this task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is exploring the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically assess students' short and open-ended explanations of code in the context of programming education. Specifically:

- The paper evaluates the effectiveness of different LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4, and LLama-2, in measuring the semantic similarity between students' line-by-line explanations of code snippets and reference explanations provided by experts. 

- It compares the performance of LLMs under different prompting strategies (baseline, few-shot learning, chain-of-thought) to encoder-based semantic textual similarity models like SBERT and BERTScore that are fine-tuned on the dataset.

- The key finding is that prompted appropriately, LLMs like GPT-4 perform comparably to fine-tuned encoders in capturing semantic similarity for evaluating students' short answers in programming. The chain-of-thought prompting strategy is most effective for LLMs.

- This is the first study exploring LLMs for automated assessment of students' code comprehension through their short explanations, highlighting their potential in education.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the viability of using LLMs for automatically grading students' short, open-ended explanations of code by comparing them to reference answers using semantic similarity, which has applications in programming tutors and tools.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores using LLMs for automated assessment of students' explanations. What are some key challenges and limitations of using LLMs for this task compared to other methods? How might the authors address these challenges?

2. The authors compare LLMs to encoder-based models. What are the key differences between these two types of models in terms of architecture and approach to semantic similarity? What are the tradeoffs?

3. The authors test several prompting strategies for the LLMs, including baseline, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT). Explain these strategies and why CoT appears most effective. How might the CoT prompts be further improved? 

4. Error analysis revealed cases where the LLMs struggled with numerical reasoning. Propose some techniques to enhance the LLMs' capabilities on numerically-grounded comprehension and similarity assessments.  

5. The dataset used consists of expert and student explanations of code. Discuss the process of collecting and annotating this type of data. What are some difficulties and how might the data collection be improved?

6. The authors test several LLMs, including various versions of ChatGPT and LLama. Compare and contrast the performances across models. What architectural or methodological differences might account for varying results?

7. The encoder models utilize transformers such as RoBERTa and CodeBERT. Explain how these models differ from the LLMs and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages for semantic similarity assessments.

8. The authors employ both Pearson and Spearman correlation metrics. Explain these metrics and their relevance in evaluating model performance for semantic similarity. What other evaluation approaches could have been used?

9. To what extent are the findings in this paper specific to assessing code comprehension versus more general semantic similarity tasks? How might the method need to be adapted for other domains?
