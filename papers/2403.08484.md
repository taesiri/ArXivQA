# [Data-oriented Dynamic Fine-tuning Parameter Selection Strategy for FISH   Mask based Efficient Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08484)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive as they have billions of parameters. Methods like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) selectively tune a small subset of parameters to reduce cost.
- Existing PEFT methods like FISH Mask randomly sample data to calculate parameter importance, failing to account for non-i.i.d. real-world data.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a data-oriented optimization algorithm called Iterative Range Decreasing (IRD) to select optimal samples and parameters for FISH Mask. 
- IRD iteratively halves the sample and parameter search space, evaluating model performance to find better sample-parameter pairs in each round. This allows dynamically adapting to the data distribution.

Key Contributions:
- Formalize the problem of suboptimal random sampling in FISH Mask PEFT method
- Propose the IRD algorithm that jointly optimizes samples and parameters selected for fine-tuning
- Conduct extensive experiments on GLUE showing IRD finds better sample-parameter configurations than FISH Mask
- Demonstrate IRD works across model types (BERT, GPT-2) and outperforms baselines
- Establish IRD as an effective data-driven optimization strategy for PEFT methods

The paper makes a key contribution in addressing the data dependency in parameter efficient fine-tuning through the IRD algorithm that iteratively searches for optimal samples and parameters. Experiments prove IRD can consistently improve performance over suboptimal random sampling.
