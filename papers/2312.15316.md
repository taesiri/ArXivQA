# [Paralinguistics-Enhanced Large Language Modeling of Spoken Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15316)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) for dialog systems ignore crucial paralinguistic information like sentiment, emotion, and speaking style conveyed through acoustic cues in speech. This results in monotonous responses that fail to capture nuances in human spoken conversations.  

- Prior works leverage sentiment/emotion for dialog modeling but primarily use text. Works on speech dialog lacks modeling of linguistic content and paralinguistics together.

Solution - ParalinGPT:
- Proposes a paralinguistics-enhanced LLM to model both linguistic content and paralinguistic attributes of spoken responses. 

- Uses text, speech embeddings from self-supervised speech encoder, and paralinguistic attributes as input to the model. Employs sentiments as paralinguistic attributes.

- Presents a serialized multitasking framework with tasks ordered as:
  1) Current sentiment prediction
  2) Response sentiment prediction
  3) Response text generation
  
- Uses Switchboard corpus with sentiment annotations as the dataset.

Main Contributions:

- Novel serialized multitasking of multiple predictions - current sentiment, response sentiment and response text generation - on real-world spoken dialogs using a multi-modal LLM

- Shows utilizing speech features and context history with sentiments improves current sentiment, response sentiment and text generation

- Proposed model achieves 6.7% and 12% better accuracy for current and response sentiment, and 3.5% improved BLEU score for response text compared to baselines

In summary, the paper presents ParalinGPT, a novel multi-modal LLM using a serialized multitasking framework that leverages text, speech and sentiment to model both content and paralinguistics in spoken dialog responses. Experiments on Switchboard corpus demonstrate improvements.
