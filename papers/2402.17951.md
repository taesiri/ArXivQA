# [QN-Mixer: A Quasi-Newton MLP-Mixer Model for Sparse-View CT   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17951)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Computed tomography (CT) is crucial for medical diagnosis but involves high radiation exposure. Sparse-view CT aims to lower radiation doses by using fewer projection views, but leads to streaking artifacts and poor image quality.
- Existing methods like post-processing CNNs have limited receptive fields. Dual-domain approaches perform interpolation in sinogram domain but have interpretability issues. 
- Deep unrolling networks reformulate reconstruction as optimization problem and learn regularization term. However, they suffer from slow convergence and high computational costs due to reliance on first-order methods like gradient descent.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes QN-Mixer, a novel second-order unrolling network based on quasi-Newton optimization. It uses latent BFGS algorithm to approximate Hessian matrix.
- Introduces Incept-Mixer as learned regularization term. It combines strengths of MLP-Mixer to capture long-range dependencies and Inception to extract multi-scale features.  
- Uses gradient encoder-decoder framework that projects gradients to lower dimensions for memory efficiency while preserving performance. Enables unrolling with superlinear convergence.

Main Contributions:
- First deep second-order unrolling network for CT reconstruction that uses latent BFGS update rule to approximate Hessian.
- Novel Incept-Mixer regularization term to capture long-range interactions in images.
- Memory-efficient latent BFGS algorithm by operating on downsampled gradient space.  
- State-of-the-art performance on AAPM and DeepLesion datasets with fewer iterations than first-order methods. Faster convergence and lower computational costs.
- Robustness on out-of-distribution data containing lesions/anomalies. Generalizability for clinical adoption.

In summary, the paper introduces a highly effective and efficient deep second-order unrolling framework for sparse-view CT reconstruction that achieves superior image quality and convergence with fewer iterations. The Incept-Mixer regularization and latent BFGS update are key innovations.
