# [Auto-scaling Vision Transformers without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11921)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it tries to address is: 

How to automate the design and scaling of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures in an efficient and principled manner, while also reducing the heavy computational cost of training ViTs?

In particular, the key research questions/challenges the paper tries to tackle are:

1) How to efficiently and automatically design a good "seed" ViT topology without relying on tedious manual design or blind architecture search? 

2) How to scale up the widths and depths of a ViT architecture in a principled way to generate model variants of different sizes?

3) How to reduce the tremendous computational cost and data required for training ViTs compared to CNNs?

To summarize, the central focus of the paper is developing an efficient automated framework called As-ViT to address the lack of principled design and scaling methods for ViTs, while also making ViT training more efficient. The key ideas proposed include:

- Leveraging network complexity metrics like expected length distortion for fast, training-free design of a promising "seed" ViT topology.

- Using the same complexity metrics to automatically scale up the seed topology into wider and deeper variants. 

- Introducing progressive elastic re-tokenization during training to reduce computational cost by over 50% while maintaining accuracy.

So in essence, the paper aims to tackle the automated, efficient design and scaling of ViTs along with reducing the high training cost, which are important open problems for the ViT architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of the main contribution:

The paper proposes As-ViT, an automated framework for designing and scaling up Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures in an efficient and principled manner, without tedious manual effort. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) It automates both the design of a "seed" ViT topology and the scaling of its depth and width to generate ViT variants of different sizes. This is done in a very efficient manner via a training-free search approach guided by network complexity metrics. 

2) It provides the first comprehensive study of different complexity metrics for ViTs, finding that expected length distortion provides the best trade-off between computation cost and correlation to actual performance.

3) It enables efficient training of ViTs via a progressive re-tokenization scheme that gradually reduces the number of tokens in early training stages to save computation.

4) The overall framework achieves strong performance on ImageNet classification and COCO detection without any manual architecture crafting. The entire automated design and scaling process takes only around 12 GPU hours.

In summary, the key innovation is the proposal of an end-to-end framework that can automatically design ViT architectures from scratch and scale them up in an efficient and principled way, replacing tedious manual efforts. The automated design is enabled by a fast training-free search approach based on network complexity metrics.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes As-ViT, an automated framework for efficiently designing and scaling Vision Transformers without training, by leveraging training-free architecture search and progressive re-tokenization strategies.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of vision transformers (ViTs):

- The key focus of this paper is on automated design and scaling of ViTs, which sets it apart from many existing works that rely on manual architecture crafting and scaling. The authors propose an end-to-end framework called As-ViT that can automatically search for a promising ViT topology and scale it up. This allows ViT design to be more efficient and principled.

- Most prior ViT papers inherit design choices like patch sizes and channel expansions from natural language processing models without much customization. This paper proposes more flexible choices like elastic kernels, attention splits, and FFN ratios tailored for computer vision. The search space is expanded compared to default ViT architectures.

- To enable training-free architecture search, this paper provides the first comprehensive study on assessing ViT's learning capability through manifold complexity measures like curvature and length distortion. Previous NAS methods for ViTs are computationally expensive as they require training models or super-networks. 

- The paper reveals that ViTs may prefer different scaling rules than CNNs, favoring wider and shallower architectures. This provides new insight compared to prior works that focused on scaling CNN-like models.

- For efficient training, this paper's idea of progressive re-tokenization to gradually increase token resolution is novel. This saves substantial training cost compared to other works on enhancing ViT training efficiency.

In summary, the automation focus, expanded design space, training-free search, analysis of scaling laws, and progressive training are unique contributions of this paper compared to related ViT literature. The paper pushes ViT research forward on multiple fronts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing more efficient and scalable methods for training vision transformers (ViTs). The authors note that training ViTs is still very computationally expensive compared to CNNs, so reducing the cost and improving scalability is an important direction. They suggest progressive tokenization during training as one approach.

- Exploring different tokenization strategies and patch sizes for ViTs. The paper points out there is no clear optimal choice yet for how to split the image into tokens/patches for a ViT. Searching over different patch sizes and allowing overlapping patches are mentioned as ways to improve ViT design.

- Better understanding the differences between ViTs and CNNs in terms of feature learning and model scaling. The paper notes ViTs exhibit some different behaviors compared to CNNs, implying the architecture scaling rules may need to be different. Analyzing these differences more thoroughly could inform how to scale ViTs.

- Automating more parts of ViT architecture design. The authors present ways to automate topology search and scaling rules for ViTs, but suggest further automating other architectural choices could be beneficial. This could help remove human bias and lead to better ViT designs.

- Exploring ViTs for additional vision tasks beyond image classification. The paper focuses on image classification but briefly shows results on object detection too. Extending automated ViT design and efficient training approaches to more vision problems is noted as an important direction.

In summary, the main suggestions are around improving efficiency, understanding differences from CNNs, automating more of the architectural design, and expanding the applications of ViTs to additional vision tasks. The overarching theme is making ViTs more amenable to practical usage by improving their efficiency and automating more design aspects.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes As-ViT, an automated framework for designing and scaling vision transformers (ViTs) without training. As-ViT first efficiently searches for an optimal "seed" ViT topology by measuring network complexity. This seed topology has design choices like overlapped image patches and wider feedforward networks in deeper layers. Starting from this seed, As-ViT then automatically scales up the ViT by greedily growing its depth and width based on complexity metrics, generating ViT models of different sizes in one run. To allow efficient training, As-ViT leverages a progressive re-tokenization strategy that starts with coarser tokens and progressively refines them during training to reduce computation. Experiments show As-ViT achieves strong performance on ImageNet classification and COCO detection. The entire automated design and scaling process takes very little computation time. The key benefit is the ability to automate ViT design and scaling in a principled manner without tedious manual architecture engineering or lengthy neural architecture search.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes As-ViT, an automated framework for designing and scaling Vision Transformers (ViTs) without training. As-ViT first searches for an optimal "seed" ViT topology by evaluating network complexities at initialization. This allows extremely fast topology search without any training. As-ViT measures the expected length distortion of mapping a circle through the ViT manifold, finding it correlates well with model accuracy. The seed topology uses overlapping image patches as tokens and expands feedforward network dimensions in deeper layers. As-ViT then scales this topology into models of different sizes, greedily growing depth and width based on network complexity. It prefers wider, shallower models. During training, As-ViT uses a novel progressive re-tokenization to reduce computation. It starts with low-resolution tokens to capture coarse information, then progressively increases to full resolution. This saves up to 56.2% of training FLOPs with minimal accuracy drop. Experiments on ImageNet classification and COCO detection show As-ViT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, using 12 GPU-hours for architecture design and scaling. The automated design and scaling framework is more efficient than prior NAS methods.

In summary, As-ViT automates ViT design and scaling with a fast training-free search based on network complexity. The discovered architectures use flexible tokenization and expansion ratios. Automated scaling grows wider, shallower networks similar to recent manual designs. Progressive re-tokenization during training adapts computation based on training phase. As-ViT requires minimal human effort for designing performant ViTs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracies can be achieved with greatly reduced architecture search costs compared to other automated ViT NAS approaches.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an automated framework called As-ViT for designing and scaling up Vision Transformers (ViTs) without tedious manual efforts. First, a "seed" ViT topology is discovered through a fast training-free search process guided by a complexity metric called expected length distortion. This seed topology has properties like overlapped image patches and increased FFN expansion ratios.
