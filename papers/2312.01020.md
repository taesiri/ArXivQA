# [ResNLS: An Improved Model for Stock Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stock price forecasting is challenging due to many complex influencing factors. 
- Existing models do not sufficiently account for the varying degrees of dependencies between adjacent and distant stock prices over time.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a hybrid neural network model called ResNLS that combines ResNet and LSTM architectures. 
- ResNet serves as a feature extractor to identify dependencies between prices across time windows.
- LSTM analyzes the initial time-series data combined with dependency features from ResNet, treated as residuals.  
- This design emphasizes modeling local dependencies between adjacent stock prices.

Contributions:
- ResNLS outperforms CNN, RNN, LSTM and other baseline models in predicting the SSE Composite Index when using 5 days of historical prices.
- The model demonstrates strong stability in predicting the CSI 300 Index using the same architecture. 
- Backtesting shows a trading strategy based on ResNLS predictions can mitigate losses during price declines and earn profits during rises.
- The model has high prediction accuracy, stability across indexes, and applicability for quant trading strategies.

Limitations and Future Work:
- The model currently only predicts closing prices. Future work could forecast opening, highest and lowest prices.
- Long-term forecasting could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic data.
- Further exploration is needed on handling unexpected events like economic shocks.

In summary, ResNLS emphasizes local price dependencies in a hybrid neural network architecture to achieve new state-of-the-art results on short-term Chinese stock market forecasting and trading strategies.
