# [Fine-Grained Embedding Dimension Optimization During Training for   Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04408)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Modern deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) use huge embedding tables that require very large memory for training and inference. Reducing the memory footprint of embeddings is important to enable efficient training and deployment of DLRMs. The size of an embedding table is determined by three factors: number of rows, number of columns (embedding dimension), and size of each value. This paper focuses on optimizing the embedding dimension to reduce memory usage. 

It is desirable to assign non-uniform embedding dimensions because:
1) Typically a large, uniform dimension is used across features, which over-provisions less informative features. 
2) Optimal dimension is non-uniform across features due to differences in how much information they contain. Exceedingly large dimensions overfit while too short dimensions are insufficient.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes FIITED, a novel Fine-grained In-Training Embedding Dimension optimization method. Key ideas:

1) Adjust dimension of each embedding vector continuously during training, assigning longer dimensions to more important vectors.

2) Importance scored based on characteristics like access frequency and gradient norms.

3) Enable memory saving during training through a chunk-based embedding storage system. 

Main Contributions:

1) FIITED reduces both model size and memory footprint during training without hurting accuracy.

2) It performs fine-grained, in-training optimization, adapting to changing data characteristics over time.

3) No need for pre-training, re-training or prior data knowledge. More flexible, faster and easier to use than most existing dimension optimization methods.

4) Experiments show >65% embedding size reduction for industry models, 93.75-99.75% for public click-through datasets, 77.5-81.25% for public classification dataset, without significant quality loss. Outperforms state-of-the-art in-training pruning method.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective in-training, fine-grained embedding dimension optimization method that reduces training memory footprint of large-scale DLRMs without affecting model quality or incurring much overhead.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FIITED, a novel method to optimize embedding dimensions in real-time during training by adjusting the size of each individual embedding vector based on its importance, enabling fine-grained control over memory usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes FIITED, a novel in-training embedding dimension optimization method that adjusts the dimension of each embedding vector during training. FIITED assigns more memory to more important embeddings and prunes the dimensions of less important embeddings to reduce memory consumption.

2) It designs a chunk-based embedding storage system to enable direct memory savings during training. This tackles the challenge of utilizing small fragmented pieces of freed memory when naively pruning embedding dimensions.  

3) Experiments on two industry models show FIITED can reduce embedding size by >65% and up to 50% without hurting model quality, saving more memory than a state-of-the-art in-training pruning method. On public datasets, FIITED prunes up to 93.75%-99.75% embeddings without significant accuracy loss.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective and practical in-training fine-grained embedding dimension optimization method FIITED to reduce memory footprint during training, along with a system design to realize direct memory savings.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel chunk-based embedding storage system to enable efficient implementation of embedding dimension adjustment during training. Can you elaborate on the rationale and details of this design? How does it tackle the challenge of utilizing small fragmented pieces of memory?

2. The paper argues that assigning non-uniform embedding dimensions is desirable. What is the evidence provided in the paper to support this argument? How does FIITED assign different dimensions to embeddings? 

3. The utility metric used to determine embedding importance seems to play a key role in FIITED. Can you discuss the formulation of this metric and why the specific choice was made? How easy is it to modify the utility metric and what are the tradeoffs?

4. Compared to existing embedding dimension search (EDS) methods, what are some of the major advantages of performing fine-grained EDS during training in FIITED? What unique opportunities does in-training optimization offer over pre-training or post-training methods?

5. When embeddings have different dimensions, computing interactions between them can become tricky. The paper adopts zero padding instead of projection methods. What is the justification provided for this design choice? What are the potential downsides?  

6. The per-chunk pruning ratios can be set either manually or dynamically generated during training. Can you compare and contrast these two approaches? What are some of the tradeoffs to consider?

7. How does FIITED trade off model accuracy, memory usage and computational overhead? What parameters can be tuned to navigate this tradeoff space? How was this explored in the experiments?

8. The experimental results show significant benefits of FIITED over baseline methods. What metrics were used to quantify model quality and memory savings? How did FIITED compare on public vs private industry datasets?

9. Could the ideas proposed in FIITED be applicable to other model components besides embeddings, such as fully connected layers? What would be required to generalize the method?

10. The paper focuses on optimization of embedding dimensions. How does FIITED compare or complement other embedding compression methods like quantization or novel hashing schemes? Could these be integrated for further improvements?
