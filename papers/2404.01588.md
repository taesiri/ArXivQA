# [Hallucination Diversity-Aware Active Learning for Text Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01588)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to hallucinate, generating seemingly plausible but factually incorrect or unverifiable information. Existing methods to mitigate hallucinations typically require costly human annotations to identify and correct the hallucinations. Also, most methods focus on alleviating a specific type of hallucination, limiting their effectiveness.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose the first active learning framework to efficiently mitigate various types of hallucinations in LLMs while minimizing the amount of human annotations required. They instantiate this framework for text summarization. To select informative samples with diverse hallucination types for annotation, they measure three types of hallucinations (semantic frame, discourse, content verifiability errors) using existing detection models. They propose a Hallucination Diversity-Aware Sampling (HADAS) strategy to ensure diversity of selected samples.

Main Contributions:
- First active learning framework to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs to reduce human annotation efforts
- Propose HADAS sample selection strategy to select samples with diverse hallucination types 
- Conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and various models demonstrating efficiency and efficacy of proposed method in mitigating hallucinations based on multiple factuality metrics while maintaining high summarization quality

The key novelty lies in developing an active learning approach specifically targeting the challenging problem of LLM hallucinations and considering diversity of hallucination types for more comprehensive mitigation. Experiments validate the advantages of the proposed approach.
