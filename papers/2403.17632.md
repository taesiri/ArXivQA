# [Data-driven Energy Consumption Modelling for Electric Micromobility   using an Open Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Range anxiety is a major barrier to adoption of electric micromobility (e-bikes, e-scooters) due to lack of reliable energy consumption estimates for trip planning. 
- Existing physical models for energy consumption struggle with accuracy and generalization due to lack of open datasets for evaluation.
- Available micromobility datasets lack key details like rider weight, terrain, weather, and battery state-of-charge.

Proposed Solution:
- Created open datasets for e-bike and e-scooter energy consumption using custom data collection pipeline.
- Data includes rider features, trip features, weather conditions along with battery voltage and state-of-charge.  
- Compared energy consumption estimates from physical model against machine learning models like LSTM, XGBoost using dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Introduced open-source e-bike and e-scooter datasets with details to enable energy consumption research.  
- Showed machine learning models outperform physical models in energy consumption forecasting accuracy by up to 83.83% for e-bikes and 82.16% for e-scooters.
- User-specific features like weight impact model accuracy, overlooked in physical models.
- Advocated data-driven approaches over physical models for reliable micromobility trip planning.

In summary, the paper bridges the gap in micromobility energy consumption data by releasing detailed open datasets of e-bike and e-scooter usage. Through experiments, data-driven ML models are shown to improve accuracy substantially over traditional mathematical models. The datasets and findings allow better electric micromobility trip planning to mitigate range anxiety.
