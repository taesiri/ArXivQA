# [Towards a Participatory and Social Justice-Oriented Measure of   Human-Robot Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There are many different measures of human-robot trust, focused on different aspects of trust. However, none of them address issues of power structures, systemic biases, or potential harms caused by HRI systems. 

- Prior approaches to developing trust measures relied on authors' expertise, input from experts, or literature reviews. This can introduce individual biases, reinforce existing power imbalances in the HRI community, and fail to capture the unique trust factors for different communities.

- HRI research often lacks diversity and inclusion, uses WEIRD participants not representative of real-world users, and can perpetuate harmful assumptions. This indicates a need for a social justice perspective.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a participatory design process grounded in a social justice framework to create a context-specific trust measure.

- Iteratively co-design the trust measure with the target community by having them: 
   1) Identify relevant trust attributes
   2) Use and evaluate the questions after robot interactions
   3) Provide quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on the measure

- Continually refine the measure until it converges on a set of questions that accurately represent trust factors for that community. 

- Apply principles from the Robots for Social Justice framework to prioritize the community's needs and consider potential harms.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new participatory and social justice-oriented approach to developing a context-specific human-robot trust measure.

- Argues this would produce a measure tailored to a community's unique circumstances and power structures, mitigating risks of bias, exclusion, and harm.

- Provides the first framework for developing trust measures focused on diversity, inclusion, and ethical HRI rather than technical accuracy alone.
