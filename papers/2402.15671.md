# [Towards a Participatory and Social Justice-Oriented Measure of   Human-Robot Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There are many different measures of human-robot trust, focused on different aspects of trust. However, none of them address issues of power structures, systemic biases, or potential harms caused by HRI systems. 

- Prior approaches to developing trust measures relied on authors' expertise, input from experts, or literature reviews. This can introduce individual biases, reinforce existing power imbalances in the HRI community, and fail to capture the unique trust factors for different communities.

- HRI research often lacks diversity and inclusion, uses WEIRD participants not representative of real-world users, and can perpetuate harmful assumptions. This indicates a need for a social justice perspective.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a participatory design process grounded in a social justice framework to create a context-specific trust measure.

- Iteratively co-design the trust measure with the target community by having them: 
   1) Identify relevant trust attributes
   2) Use and evaluate the questions after robot interactions
   3) Provide quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on the measure

- Continually refine the measure until it converges on a set of questions that accurately represent trust factors for that community. 

- Apply principles from the Robots for Social Justice framework to prioritize the community's needs and consider potential harms.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new participatory and social justice-oriented approach to developing a context-specific human-robot trust measure.

- Argues this would produce a measure tailored to a community's unique circumstances and power structures, mitigating risks of bias, exclusion, and harm.

- Provides the first framework for developing trust measures focused on diversity, inclusion, and ethical HRI rather than technical accuracy alone.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a participatory design process grounded in a social justice framework to develop a culturally-competent, community-centered measure of human-robot trust.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a participatory and social justice-oriented approach for the design and evaluation of a measure of human-robot trust. Specifically, the paper argues that:

1) The development and evaluation of a reliable measure of human-robot trust should involve the participation of the community for whom the robot system is intended to benefit. This participatory design process would allow the community members to co-design the trust measure by identifying relevant attributes, evaluating the measure after interactions, and providing feedback to iteratively improve it.

2) The participatory design process should be grounded in a social justice framework that considers the unique capabilities, structural conditions, and power structures surrounding the community. This is intended to produce a trust measure that captures the factors that accurately reflect what impacts that community's trust in a robot.

In essence, the paper argues for a participatory, community-centered approach to developing a context-specific trust measure that is sensitive to existing inequities and power structures. This would be a new contribution over existing "one-size-fits-all" trust measures that fail to address issues of bias and harm in human-robot interaction research and systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed approach argues that a participatory design process should be used to develop a human-robot trust measure. What are some of the key benefits of using a participatory design approach compared to other methods that have been used to develop trust measures? 

2. The paper suggests the participatory design process should involve iteratively developing the trust measure with members of the community it is intended for. What are some techniques that could be used during each iteration to evaluate and refine the trust measure?

3. What are some ethical concerns and potential harms that should be considered when using a participatory design process to develop a human-robot trust measure? How could these risks be mitigated?

4. The proposed approach also aligns with a social justice framework for human-robot interaction. In what ways could engaging the community using this framework address issues of equity and inclusion compared to traditional approaches? 

5. What structural conditions and power structures should be examined and considered when developing a trust measure using the proposed participatory and social justice-oriented approach?

6. How might the process of weighting the importance of different trust attributes differ when using the proposed approach compared to other methods? What community differences should guide decisions about weighting?  

7. What are some techniques a research team could use during the participatory design process to critically examine and account for their own biases? 

8. The paper argues the proposed approach could produce ad hoc trust measures for different contexts and capture the impact of various individual factors on trust. Provide some examples of how the resulting trust measure could differ based on the community and context.

9. What are some specific ethical challenges and considerations regarding data collection, privacy, anonymity, and reporting when conducting HRI studies using the proposed participatory and social justice-oriented approach? 

10. How might the validation process for a trust measure developed using the proposed approach differ from typical methods of validation? What additional forms of validation could strengthen an argument for its reliability and generalizability?
