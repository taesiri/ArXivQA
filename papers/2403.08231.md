# [Object Permanence Filter for Robust Tracking with Interactive Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Unreliable perception systems are a major bottleneck for deploying interactive robots in the real world. Tracking-by-detection algorithms rely heavily on accurate object detection and motion prediction, but fail in inevitable occlusion scenarios during human-robot interaction. Missing, noisy or infeasible measurements due to occlusions can negatively impact robot behavior and human safety.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes the Object Permanence Filter (OPF) to achieve resilient multi-object tracking. It incorporates the concept of object permanence from human cognitive development, i.e. that objects continue to exist even when not perceived through senses. The OPF modifies the particle filter update step with a novel Object Permanence (OP) Update when measurements are missing. 

The OP Update has three key modules:
1) Dynamics module: Detects if object was moving before occlusion using past trajectory. If so, fits dynamics model to provide virtual measurements during occlusion.  
2) Occluder module: Decides which other tracked object is the occluder using Bhattacharyya distance between objects' distributions. Uses occluder's measurement as virtual observation.
3) Uncertainty module: Artificially scales the covariance matrix to increase uncertainty during occlusion.

Additionally, a Feedback module monitors uncertainty and can trigger human interventions or make the robot's tracking controller more cautious when uncertainty crosses a threshold.

Main Contributions:
- Concept of object permanence from human cognition introduced for robust robot perception
- Object Permanence Filter integrating assumptions of object persistence into particle filter
- Object Permanence Update step with dynamics, occluder and uncertainty modules providing virtual observations and uncertainty scaling
- Feedback module allowing safe human interventions based on uncertainty
- Demonstrated accurate tracking of prolonged static and dynamic occlusions in simulation and hardware
- Generalizable to different measurement types like computer vision and motion capture

The OPF enables robots to maintain estimates of objects even under heavy occlusion, leading to more robust and safer human-robot interaction.
