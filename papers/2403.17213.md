# [AnimateMe: 4D Facial Expressions via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17213)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AnimateMe: 4D Facial Expressions via Diffusion Models":

Problem:
- Generating realistic and controllable 4D facial animations is an important but challenging problem in computer graphics and human-computer interaction. 
- Existing methods have limitations in producing high-fidelity extreme facial expressions and ensuring temporal coherence in the animations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel generative model called "AnimateMe" to synthesize customizable 4D facial expressions using diffusion models.
- It introduces the first diffusion process operating directly on 3D meshes by employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as denoising models. 
- A consistent noise sampling strategy is proposed to ensure smooth transitions between animation frames.
- The model takes as input a neutral mesh, expression labels (category and intensity), and produces realistic 4D facial animations that transition from neutral to target expressions.

Main Contributions:
- First diffusion formulation tailored for meshes using GNNs as denoising models.
- First fully data-driven approach for customizable 4D facial expression generation using diffusion models. 
- A sampling strategy called "consistent noise sampling" which improves temporal coherence and accelerates generation.
- Quantitative and qualitative experiments showing the method generates more realistic extreme expressions compared to prior arts.
- Demonstrated the approach on generating textured facial animations by training geometry and texture models separately.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to generate high-quality and controllable 4D facial animations by adapting diffusion models to operate directly on meshes. The consistent noise sampling strategy and use of expression intensity conditioning enables the generation of smooth and extreme expressions.
