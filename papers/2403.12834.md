# [Embarrassingly Simple Scribble Supervision for 3D Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12834)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Creating large-scale densely annotated medical image datasets for segmentation is very costly and time-consuming. Scribble supervision has emerged as a way to reduce annotation effort, but existing methods have failed to clearly demonstrate effectiveness and generalizability.  
- Two key issues limit scribble supervision methods: 1) Many are tightly coupled to specific segmentation models, limiting integration of latest advances. 2) Lack of systematic evaluation across diverse tasks to demonstrate generalization.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new large-scale benchmark with 7 diverse medical segmentation datasets to enable systematic evaluation.
- Propose using "partial losses" that ignore non-annotated voxels during loss computation. Can be seamlessly integrated into any segmentation model while preserving original loss formulations.  

Key Contributions:
- Creation of a medical scribble supervision benchmark covering diverse tasks, modalities and pathologies.
- Demonstration that lightweight partial loss methods generalize better than complex systemic methods optimized for specific tasks. 
- Simple partial cross-entropy (pCE) baseline already achieves strong performance, establishing it as a robust approach.
- Extension of partial losses to full loss formulations (e.g. partial Dice) unlocks state-of-the-art scribble learning in nnU-Net.
- Partial losses compatibile with any sparse annotation, not just scribbles. Outperform alternative sparse strategies.
- Provide open-source implementation of partial losses in nnU-Net to serve as baseline for future scribble supervision developments.

In summary, this paper makes scribble annotation a highly practical alternative by introducing a systematic benchmark, demonstrating the superior generalizability of lightweight methods based on partial losses, and providing an easy-to-integrate open-source implementation that achieves new state-of-the-art performance for learning from scribbles.
