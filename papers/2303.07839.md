# ChatGPT Prompt Patterns for Improving Code Quality, Refactoring,   Requirements Elicitation, and Software Design

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not appear to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, the overall focus seems to be on presenting and evaluating a catalog of prompt design techniques, in the form of patterns, that can be applied to improve software engineering tasks when using large language models like ChatGPT. Some of the key goals and contributions of the paper that could be viewed as related to an overarching research focus are:- To provide a catalog of reusable prompt patterns that solve common problems in interacting with LLMs for software engineering. This allows codifying and sharing prompt engineering knowledge.- To introduce patterns spanning requirements, design, code quality, and refactoring. This provides techniques applicable throughout the software life-cycle. - To demonstrate combining prompt patterns to accomplish more complex goals. The interactions of patterns are explored.- To facilitate reasoning about software systems earlier through patterns for requirements elicitation, simulation, and design. This enables identifying issues earlier when cheaper to fix.So in summary, while not an explicit research question, the paper seems focused on presenting and evaluating a catalog of prompt patterns that can enhance software engineering when using LLMs. The patterns aid requirements, design, code quality, refactoring, and span the software life-cycle.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing the concept of "prompt patterns" for software engineering, which are reusable prompt designs to solve common problems when using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to automate software engineering tasks. 2. Providing a catalog of 13 prompt patterns that have been applied to various software engineering tasks, such as ensuring code is decoupled from libraries, creating API specifications from requirements, and improving code quality attributes.3. Exploring the relationships between different prompt patterns, such as compounds and sequences that are effective when used together. 4. Documenting prompt patterns used for requirements elicitation, rapid prototyping, improving code quality, refactoring, deployment, and testing.5. Demonstrating prompt patterns applied to case studies, such as creating a REST API specification from requirements, inserting intermediate abstractions to decouple code from dependencies, and refactoring code to a new data format.In summary, the main contribution appears to be formally defining the concept of prompt patterns for software engineering tasks, providing a catalog of reusable patterns, and showcasing their application through examples. The paper aims to help software engineers more effectively leverage capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT by using prompt engineering.
