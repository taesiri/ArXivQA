# [ChatGPT Prompt Patterns for Improving Code Quality, Refactoring,   Requirements Elicitation, and Software Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07839)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it does not appear to have an explicitly stated central research question or hypothesis. However, the overall focus seems to be on presenting and evaluating a catalog of prompt design techniques, in the form of patterns, that can be applied to improve software engineering tasks when using large language models like ChatGPT. 

Some of the key goals and contributions of the paper that could be viewed as related to an overarching research focus are:

- To provide a catalog of reusable prompt patterns that solve common problems in interacting with LLMs for software engineering. This allows codifying and sharing prompt engineering knowledge.

- To introduce patterns spanning requirements, design, code quality, and refactoring. This provides techniques applicable throughout the software life-cycle. 

- To demonstrate combining prompt patterns to accomplish more complex goals. The interactions of patterns are explored.

- To facilitate reasoning about software systems earlier through patterns for requirements elicitation, simulation, and design. This enables identifying issues earlier when cheaper to fix.

So in summary, while not an explicit research question, the paper seems focused on presenting and evaluating a catalog of prompt patterns that can enhance software engineering when using LLMs. The patterns aid requirements, design, code quality, refactoring, and span the software life-cycle.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing the concept of "prompt patterns" for software engineering, which are reusable prompt designs to solve common problems when using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to automate software engineering tasks. 

2. Providing a catalog of 13 prompt patterns that have been applied to various software engineering tasks, such as ensuring code is decoupled from libraries, creating API specifications from requirements, and improving code quality attributes.

3. Exploring the relationships between different prompt patterns, such as compounds and sequences that are effective when used together. 

4. Documenting prompt patterns used for requirements elicitation, rapid prototyping, improving code quality, refactoring, deployment, and testing.

5. Demonstrating prompt patterns applied to case studies, such as creating a REST API specification from requirements, inserting intermediate abstractions to decouple code from dependencies, and refactoring code to a new data format.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be formally defining the concept of prompt patterns for software engineering tasks, providing a catalog of reusable patterns, and showcasing their application through examples. The paper aims to help software engineers more effectively leverage capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT by using prompt engineering.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces prompt design techniques and patterns for using large language models like ChatGPT to automate common software engineering tasks such as ensuring code quality, refactoring, and requirements elicitation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of using large language models like ChatGPT for software engineering:

Scope and Focus:

- This paper has a strong focus on prompt engineering and designing effective prompts to guide ChatGPT to automate software engineering tasks. Many other papers have focused more narrowly on code generation capabilities.

- The paper covers the full software lifecycle, from requirements to testing, whereas much prior work has concentrated only on code generation.

- The paper introduces the idea of "prompt patterns" as reusable prompt designs to solve common software engineering problems. This provides a more systematic framework compared to ad hoc prompt examples.

Novel Contributions:

- The prompt pattern catalog for software engineering tasks is a novel contribution not seen in prior work. This provides a starting point that can be built upon.

- Exploration of using ChatGPT for requirements, architecture, and design is less common than code generation. The examples in these areas are innovative.

- Simulation prompt patterns like API Simulator and Change Request Simulation show unique applications of ChatGPT.

- Combining patterns shows how to chain prompts together for more complex goals.

Methodology:

- The paper is more exploratory, documenting patterns found useful. Other work has done more quantitative evaluations of quality.

- Patterns draw from community examples and authors' own use rather than lab studies. Findings are based on experience rather than controlled experiments.

In summary, key differentiators are the focus on prompt engineering, broader lifecycle coverage, introducing prompt patterns, and more qualitative evaluation of patterns. But the exploratory nature provides a catalog of patterns that can be quantitatively studied.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

1. Expanding the catalog of prompt patterns for software engineering tasks. The authors present an initial set of 13 patterns, but suggest more patterns could be identified and documented to cover additional software engineering scenarios.

2. Quantitative comparison of prompt patterns. The authors propose that as more prompt patterns are developed, they could be quantitatively compared to each other in terms of effectiveness for addressing different software engineering challenges. 

3. Reducing variation/non-determinism in prompt patterns. The authors note that prompts exhibit some stochastic behavior even when following defined rules. They suggest researching prompt designs that can limit this variation in targeted areas.

4. Prompt engineering for quality assurance and versioning. The authors briefly note these as important areas for future research to ensure accuracy and traceability when using prompts over time.

5. Studying the depth of LLMs' software engineering capabilities. The authors suggest the capabilities of models like ChatGPT for assisting with software engineering tasks are not yet fully understood or appreciated. More research is needed to explore the extent of these capabilities.

6. Developing prompting approaches for leveraging LLMs with external tools. The authors cite prior work on using prompts to help LLMs utilize outside tooling, suggesting this as a direction for future research.

7. Reducing need for human oversight of LLM-generated outputs. The authors note the need for close human scrutiny of LLM outputs at present. More research is needed to increase reliability and reduce human oversight needs.

In summary, the key directions cover expanding the knowledge base of prompt engineering techniques, quantitatively assessing these techniques, reducing variability in prompts, integrating prompts with software processes, further exploring LLM capabilities, and increasing autonomy.
