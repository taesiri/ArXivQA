# [Uncertainty Quantification for Gradient-based Explanations in Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17224)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Explanation methods are important for interpreting and debugging neural network models. However, there is uncertainty associated with the explanations generated by these methods. 
- Quantifying the uncertainty in explanations can help determine the reliability and trustworthiness of the generated explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a pipeline to quantify explanation uncertainty by combining uncertainty estimation methods (e.g. MC-Dropout, Deep Ensembles) and explanation methods (e.g. Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation).

- The uncertainty estimation methods produce multiple stochastic forward passes, generating an output distribution. Applying the explanation methods to these output samples produces a distribution of explanations.

- Analyze this explanation distribution by computing the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the explanation heatmaps. Mean represents expected explanation, standard deviation shows uncertainty, and coefficient of variation combines both into one metric.

- Modify pixel insertion/deletion metrics to quantify quality of explanation distributions instead of individual explanations.

Contributions:
- Demonstrate combining uncertainty estimation and explanation methods can quantify explanation uncertainty

- Identify statistical metrics like coefficient of variation to represent explanation uncertainty concisely

- Propose modified pixel insertion/deletion metrics to analyze quality of explanation distributions 

- Show pipeline works for image classification (CIFAR-10, FER+) and tabular regression (California Housing dataset)

- Find Guided Backpropagation explanations have lower uncertainty compared to Integrated Gradients

Overall, the key idea is to quantify the reliability of explanations by modeling them as distributions instead of deterministic, using uncertainty estimation techniques. This allows more informed usage of explanations.
