# [Design and evaluation of a multi-finger skin-stretch tactile interface   for hand rehabilitation robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12060)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Tactile information is crucial for motor control and manipulation of objects, yet current robotic neurorehabilitation systems lack tactile feedback. This may limit the transfer of skills gained in virtual environments to activities of daily living. Skin stretch especially provides relevant tactile cues, but most skin stretch interfaces rely on estimates of finger pad stiffness for force rendering, limiting accuracy. Accurate multi-finger skin stretch interfaces have not been explored in hand rehabilitation robots.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors designed a multi-finger skin stretch tactile interface integrated into the PRIDE hand rehabilitation robot. The interface has a 2 degree-of-freedom moving platform providing skin stretch to the finger pads of all fingers. To enable accurate closed-loop force control, they developed a compact, low-cost custom magnetic-based 3D force sensor. The sensor measures deformations of a magnet embedded in silicone to estimate applied forces.

Main Contributions:
- A multi-finger skin stretch tactile interface rendering 2D skin deformations to enhance ecological validity of training
- A low-cost compact magnetic-based 3D force sensor achieving large 8N shear force ranges in a small size
- Closed-loop control of skin stretch forces addressing limitations of open-loop rendering relying on stiffness  
- Detailed static, dynamic and frequency characterization of custom sensor and tactile interface
- Accuracies and bandwidths achieved are sufficient for rendering most activities of daily living

The tactile interface is a first step towards more realistic haptic feedback in robotic rehabilitation. It has potential to improve therapy outcomes by enhancing skill transfer to daily life activities. The characterization provides insights for improving multi-finger skin stretch interfaces and magnetic-based sensors.
