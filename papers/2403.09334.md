# [Video Editing via Factorized Diffusion Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video editing is an important capability for generating online video content, but training such models is challenging due to the lack of supervised video editing data.
- Existing methods for "training-free" video editing have limitations in performance and capability.

Proposed Solution:
- Key idea: Factorize video editing into (1) precise editing of individual frames, and (2) ensuring temporal consistency between frames.  
- Two-phase approach:
   - Phase 1: Train an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter on a frozen text-to-image backbone. Stack both adapters on the backbone to enable some basic video editing capability.
   - Phase 2: Introduce a new unsupervised distillation method called "Factorized Diffusion Distillation (FDD)" to align the two adapters into a student model optimized for video editing. FDD uses score distillation and adversarial losses from the frozen adapters to teach precise editing and temporal consistency.

- Final model is called EVE (Emu Video Editing)

Main Contributions:
- State-of-the-art video editing results on TGVE benchmark without any supervised video editing data
- Introduction of new automatic metrics using ViCLIP to evaluate temporal consistency 
- Expansion of TGVE benchmark with additional editing tasks related to adding, removing, changing texture of objects
- Demonstration that FDD can align other combinations of adapters, enabling personalized and stylized image editing

In summary, the key innovation is an unsupervised distillation method that teaches a student model to edit videos by factorizing knowledge from an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter. This achieves new SOTA results for video editing without any supervised data.
