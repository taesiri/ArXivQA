# [Video Editing via Factorized Diffusion Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Video editing is an important capability for generating online video content, but training such models is challenging due to the lack of supervised video editing data.
- Existing methods for "training-free" video editing have limitations in performance and capability.

Proposed Solution:
- Key idea: Factorize video editing into (1) precise editing of individual frames, and (2) ensuring temporal consistency between frames.  
- Two-phase approach:
   - Phase 1: Train an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter on a frozen text-to-image backbone. Stack both adapters on the backbone to enable some basic video editing capability.
   - Phase 2: Introduce a new unsupervised distillation method called "Factorized Diffusion Distillation (FDD)" to align the two adapters into a student model optimized for video editing. FDD uses score distillation and adversarial losses from the frozen adapters to teach precise editing and temporal consistency.

- Final model is called EVE (Emu Video Editing)

Main Contributions:
- State-of-the-art video editing results on TGVE benchmark without any supervised video editing data
- Introduction of new automatic metrics using ViCLIP to evaluate temporal consistency 
- Expansion of TGVE benchmark with additional editing tasks related to adding, removing, changing texture of objects
- Demonstration that FDD can align other combinations of adapters, enabling personalized and stylized image editing

In summary, the key innovation is an unsupervised distillation method that teaches a student model to edit videos by factorizing knowledge from an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter. This achieves new SOTA results for video editing without any supervised data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new unsupervised approach for training a state-of-the-art video editing model without any supervised video editing data by separately training an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter, then aligning them using a novel distillation procedure called Factorized Diffusion Distillation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new unsupervised method for training a video editing model without requiring any supervised video editing data. Specifically:

1) They propose a two-stage approach: first train an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter separately, then align them for video editing using their new unsupervised distillation method called Factorized Diffusion Distillation (FDD). 

2) FDD distills knowledge from the two frozen adapter teachers into a student model simultaneously using a combination of score distribution matching and adversarial losses. This aligns the adapters towards precise video editing with temporal consistency.

3) The resulting model, Emu Video Edit (EVE), establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Text-Guided Video Editing (TGVE) benchmark without using any supervised video editing data.

4) They show FDD can be used to align other combinations of adapters as well, demonstrating its potential for unlocking new capabilities beyond video editing.

In summary, the key innovation is the unsupervised FDD method to align adapters for learning new skills like precise and temporally consistent video editing, without needing manually labeled training data. The EVE model trained with FDD sets a new SOTA in video editing.

The paper introduces a new unsupervised approach for training a text-guided video editing model called EVE without relying on any supervised video editing data. The key ideas involve training separate image editing and video generation adapters, then aligning them for the video editing task using a new distillation procedure called Factorized Diffusion Distillation (FDD). FDD helps teach the model to edit frames precisely while maintaining temporal consistency across frames. The adapters serve as teacher models in this unsupervised distillation process. The resulting model EVE sets a new state-of-the-art on the TGVE benchmark for video editing. So keywords like video editing, diffusion, adapters, distillation, temporal consistency, alignment, etc. are central to describing the key contributions of this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new unsupervised distillation procedure called Factorized Diffusion Distillation (FDD). Can you explain in detail how FDD works and what are its key components? 

2. The goal of FDD is to align an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter for the task of video editing. Why is it beneficial to have these two separate adapters instead of a single adapter? What are the advantages?

3. The paper argues that video editing can be factorized into two distinct criteria - precise editing of frames and temporal consistency. Can you expand more on why this factorization is important? How does it help in the design of the method?

4. Explain the student and teacher model setup used in FDD. What is the student trying to learn and what does each teacher provide supervision for?

5. Two losses are used in FDD - Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss and adversarial loss. Why is each of these losses essential and what do they exactly optimize for? 

6. The discriminators in the adversarial loss try to differentiate between samples from the teachers and the student. Intuitively, why does this process help in aligning the adapters?

7. K-Bin diffusion sampling is used during training for timestep sampling. What is the motivation behind it and how does it avoid train-test discrepancy?

8. The paper demonstrates application of FDD to other adapter combinations beyond video editing. Can you think of some other adapter combinations where FDD could prove useful?

9. One limitation mentioned is that performance is upper bounded by the teacher models. How can this limitation be potentially addressed? Are there ways to improve upon the teachers? 

10. The paper benchmarks the video editing capabilities extensively. What are some ways the evaluation protocol and metrics can be further improved or expanded upon?
