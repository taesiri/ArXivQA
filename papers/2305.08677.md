# [Natural Language Decomposition and Interpretation of Complex Utterances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08677)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1) Can an approach that decomposes complex natural language utterances into simpler steps, and parses each step independently, allow a language-to-code model to handle complex utterances with minimal complex training data? 

The paper proposes an approach called Decomp that uses a pre-trained language model to break down a complex utterance into simpler natural language steps. Each step is then parsed into a code fragment using a semantic parser trained primarily on simpler utterance-code pairs. The key hypothesis is that decomposition into steps resembling the training data will allow the model to handle novel and complex utterances.

2) How does the proposed decomposition approach compare to standard few-shot prompting techniques for parsing complex utterances directly?

The paper compares Decomp to a baseline that uses few-shot prompting to directly parse complex utterances into code, without decomposing them first. A key hypothesis is that decomposition into steps will allow more effective use of the pre-trained language model, outperforming direct prompting.

3) How effective is the proposed approach on a new dataset, DecU, collected specifically to study utterance decomposition in language-to-code space?

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called DecU featuring elementary and complex utterances paired with code. A hypothesis is that DecU reflects some of the key challenges of decomposition for language-to-code translation. Experiments on DecU are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, the key hypotheses are around using utterance decomposition to handle complex language-to-code translation with minimal supervision, outperforming direct few-shot prompting approaches, as demonstrated on a new decomposition-focused dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing an approach called Decomp that enables handling complex natural language utterances by decomposing them into simpler steps. Specifically:

- They propose Decomp, which uses a pre-trained language model to hierarchically decompose a complex utterance into a sequence of smaller natural language steps. Each step is then parsed into a program fragment using an existing semantic parser trained on simpler utterances. 

- They introduce a new benchmark dataset called DeCU (Decomposition of Complex Utterances) to evaluate decomposition approaches. The dataset consists of elementary utterances paired with short programs, as well as complex utterances annotated with decompositions into elementary utterances.

- Experiments on DeCU show that Decomp outperforms standard few-shot prompting approaches on parsing complex utterances, despite using very little training data of complex examples.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing and evaluating an approach to handle elaboration user requests by leveraging decomposition in natural language space and an existing simple semantic parser. The decomposition enables better generalization from limited complex training data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an approach called Decomp that uses a pretrained language model to break down complex natural language utterances into simpler steps, parses each step into a program fragment, and combines the fragments to generate programs that can accomplish complex user goals, outperforming standard few-shot prompting methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to related work on natural language interfaces and semantic parsing:

- The paper introduces a new dataset, DeCU, for evaluating decomposition of complex utterances into simpler steps/programs. Most prior work has focused on open-ended question decomposition or grounding instructions to robot actions. DeCU provides a new benchmark more directly focused on parsing user commands to executable APIs.

- The proposed Decomp method combines insights from prior work on question decomposition and leveraging LLMs for reasoning/program synthesis. It uses the LLM to decompose complex requests into simpler steps, then leverages an existing parser (trained on simpler utterances) to map steps to programs.

- Experiments demonstrate that Decomp outperforms standard few-shot prompting approaches on the new DeCU benchmark. This indicates the value of decomposition for handling complex requests, compared to prompting alone.

- Analysis also reveals limitations of current methods - around 50% of predicted programs are not well-formed, indicating significant room for improvement in structural generalization. The paper provides useful error analysis.

- The approach does not execute intermediate programs, so cannot condition later steps on execution results. This limits expressiveness compared to systems that interleave execution. Extending to handle execution results could be an interesting direction for future work.

Overall, the paper makes a nice contribution in collecting a new benchmark focused on utterance decomposition, and demonstrating benefits of decomposition + parsing vs just prompting. There are still significant challenges in generalization, but Decomp represents a promising direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the accuracy of the predicted natural language decomposition steps. The authors note there is room to improve the quality of the intermediate NL steps generated by their method, which could lead to better overall parsing accuracy. They suggest exploring ways to achieve this, such as through improved prompt design.

- Incorporating execution feedback. The authors mention their method currently only conditions on generated programs, not their actual execution results. They suggest incorporating execution feedback could improve the expressiveness of the model, like allowing control flow operations conditioned on intermediate results. 

- Constraint-based decoding. The authors note many errors are due to hallucinated or invalid APIs/arguments. They suggest exploring constrained decoding methods that restrict outputs to valid functions could reduce these errors.

- Generalization. The authors note structural generalization on their dataset remains challenging, with many invalid outputs. Improving generalization is noted as an area for future work.

- Multi-step reasoning. The authors suggest their hierarchical decomposition approach could be extended to even more complex utterances and reasoning if coupled with execution feedback. Exploring multi-step inferential capabilities is noted as a research direction.

- Dataset size. The authors use a relatively small dataset of 104 utterances. Expanding the data size could help further validate and improve the approach.

In summary, the main future directions pointed out are improving decomposition accuracy, incorporating execution, constraining outputs, boosting generalization, expanding inferential capabilities, and increasing dataset scale. The overall goal is developing models that can handle more elaborate user requests in an open-ended way.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an approach called Decomp that enables handling of complex natural language utterances by breaking them down into simpler steps using a pre-trained language model. They collect a new benchmark dataset called DeCU to evaluate models on decomposition of complex utterances into elementary steps. The dataset contains elementary utterances paired with short programs, as well as longer and more diverse complex utterances annotated with decompositions into sequences of elementary utterances. Their approach uses the pre-trained language model to generate a sequence of simpler natural language steps for a complex utterance, with each step then parsed into a program fragment using examples of elementary utterances. Experiments on their dataset show this approach outperforms standard few-shot prompting that tries to directly map an utterance to a full program. The work combines insights from prior work on question decomposition and leveraging pre-trained models to perform reasoning in natural language space. Their method and dataset enable building natural language interfaces that can handle complex requests without large amounts of labeled complex examples.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an approach called Decomp that enables handling complex natural language utterances by breaking them down into simpler steps. The authors collect a new dataset called DeCU to evaluate decomposition models. DeCU contains elementary utterances paired with short programs, as well as complex utterances annotated with decompositions into sequences of elementary utterances. 

The Decomp approach uses a pre-trained language model to decompose a complex utterance into simpler natural language steps. Each step is then parsed into a program fragment using an existing semantic parser trained on the elementary utterances. Experiments on DeCU demonstrate that Decomp outperforms standard few-shot prompting baselines in generating programs for complex utterances. Additional analysis examines the quality of the generated natural language steps and characterizes the errors made by Decomp. The paper helps make it possible to build natural language interfaces that can handle complex goals without large labeled datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces an approach called Decomp that enables handling of complex natural language utterances by first using a pre-trained language model to decompose the complex utterance into a sequence of simpler natural language steps. Each of these steps resembles an elementary utterance that can be mapped to a sub-program using an existing semantic parser trained on simpler utterances. Specifically, the method uses an iterative process where a language model generates the next natural language step conditioned on the original utterance and any previous steps and sub-programs. Then a semantic parser maps that natural language step to a program fragment, which can refer to variables from earlier sub-programs. By decomposing a complex utterance into simpler steps that resemble the elementary utterances the semantic parser was trained on, the method is able to interpret complex utterances without large amounts of supervision. The approach is evaluated on a new dataset called DeCU that contains elementary utterances mapped to programs as well as complex utterances annotated with decompositions. Experiments show the proposed decomp approach outperforms standard few-shot prompting baselines for interpreting complex utterances in this dataset.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of building natural language interfaces that can handle complex user requests, when only simple elementary utterances have been annotated with programs during training. The key question is how to enable the system to generalize to more complex utterances at test time.

The paper focuses on a scenario where:

- A dataset of elementary utterances mapped to simple programs has been collected. These cover basic narrow intents.

- Users may express more elaborate requests at test time that require longer programs and represent broader goals. 

- Only a small number of complex utterances are available with annotated decompositions into elementary utterances.

The goal is to build a model that can generalize to handle varied complex requests at test time, despite having limited complex training data.

The key idea proposed is to decompose complex utterances into simpler natural language steps, by using a pre-trained language model. Each step can then hopefully be parsed into a program fragment using the provided elementary utterances.

So in summary, the paper tackles the problem of handling complex user utterances in natural language to code systems, when most of the available training data consists of simple utterance-program pairs. The proposed solution is to leverage language models to decompose complex utterances into steps that resemble the simple annotated utterances.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a new method called Decomposition (Decomp) for parsing complex natural language utterances into executable programs. The key idea is to leverage large language models to decompose complex utterances into simpler steps resembling elementary utterances, for which programs can be more readily generated. Each step is parsed independently using a semantic parser trained on elementary examples.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper introduces an approach called Decomp that enables parsing complex natural language utterances into executable programs, by decomposing them into simpler natural language steps. The approach relies on a small set of annotated examples of elementary utterances paired with programs, as well as a handful of complex utterance decompositions. At test time, a large language model is used in an in-context learning setup to generate a sequence of natural language steps given a complex utterance. Each step is then parsed independently into a program fragment, with the model drawing on the provided elementary examples. To evaluate their approach, the authors collect a new benchmark dataset called DeCU (Decomposition of Complex Utterances) featuring elementary and complex examples. Experiments on DeCU demonstrate that Decomp outperforms standard few-shot prompting approaches for mapping complex language directly to programs. The proposed approach thus enables building natural language interfaces that can handle elaborate user requests, without requiring large labeled datasets of complex examples.
