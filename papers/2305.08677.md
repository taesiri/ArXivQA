# [Natural Language Decomposition and Interpretation of Complex Utterances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08677)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) Can an approach that decomposes complex natural language utterances into simpler steps, and parses each step independently, allow a language-to-code model to handle complex utterances with minimal complex training data? The paper proposes an approach called Decomp that uses a pre-trained language model to break down a complex utterance into simpler natural language steps. Each step is then parsed into a code fragment using a semantic parser trained primarily on simpler utterance-code pairs. The key hypothesis is that decomposition into steps resembling the training data will allow the model to handle novel and complex utterances.2) How does the proposed decomposition approach compare to standard few-shot prompting techniques for parsing complex utterances directly?The paper compares Decomp to a baseline that uses few-shot prompting to directly parse complex utterances into code, without decomposing them first. A key hypothesis is that decomposition into steps will allow more effective use of the pre-trained language model, outperforming direct prompting.3) How effective is the proposed approach on a new dataset, DecU, collected specifically to study utterance decomposition in language-to-code space?The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called DecU featuring elementary and complex utterances paired with code. A hypothesis is that DecU reflects some of the key challenges of decomposition for language-to-code translation. Experiments on DecU are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.In summary, the key hypotheses are around using utterance decomposition to handle complex language-to-code translation with minimal supervision, outperforming direct few-shot prompting approaches, as demonstrated on a new decomposition-focused dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing an approach called Decomp that enables handling complex natural language utterances by decomposing them into simpler steps. Specifically:- They propose Decomp, which uses a pre-trained language model to hierarchically decompose a complex utterance into a sequence of smaller natural language steps. Each step is then parsed into a program fragment using an existing semantic parser trained on simpler utterances. - They introduce a new benchmark dataset called DeCU (Decomposition of Complex Utterances) to evaluate decomposition approaches. The dataset consists of elementary utterances paired with short programs, as well as complex utterances annotated with decompositions into elementary utterances.- Experiments on DeCU show that Decomp outperforms standard few-shot prompting approaches on parsing complex utterances, despite using very little training data of complex examples.In summary, the key contribution is introducing and evaluating an approach to handle elaboration user requests by leveraging decomposition in natural language space and an existing simple semantic parser. The decomposition enables better generalization from limited complex training data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces an approach called Decomp that uses a pretrained language model to break down complex natural language utterances into simpler steps, parses each step into a program fragment, and combines the fragments to generate programs that can accomplish complex user goals, outperforming standard few-shot prompting methods.
