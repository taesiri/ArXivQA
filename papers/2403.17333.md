# [The Pursuit of Fairness in Artificial Intelligence Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the pursuit of fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) models. As AI systems are increasingly being used to make impactful decisions, concerns around potential biases leading to unfair outcomes have emerged. 

The paper first defines key concepts around fairness and bias in machine learning. Different notions of fairness are explored including group fairness, individual fairness, separation metrics, sufficiency metrics and causal fairness. Different types of biases that can arise in AI systems are also categorized into data-driven, human and model biases. Practical cases across sectors like criminal justice, healthcare, education etc where biased AI systems have caused issues are discussed.

The paper then provides an in-depth analysis of various techniques used to promote fairness and mitigate bias in AI systems. These are grouped into three main stages - pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing. Pre-processing techniques like sampling, causal approaches, relabeling etc. aim to remove bias from the training data itself. In-processing techniques focus on modifying the model training process and include methods like adversarial learning, regularization and reinforcement learning. Post-processing techniques adjust the predictions of an already trained model. In addition, the paper also explores the negative impacts biased AI systems can have on user trust and experience, and discusses ethical considerations for developing fair AI systems.

The key contributions of this comprehensive survey are:
(1) An extensive taxonomy of fairness definitions, bias types and bias mitigation strategies based on review of literature. 
(2) Analysis of practical cases of bias and unfairness issues caused by AI systems across different real-world domains.  
(3) Thorough evaluation of the wide range of techniques used by researchers to detect and reduce bias while promoting fairness in AI models.
(4) Discussion of impacts on users due to biased models and ethical guidelines for fair AI development.

Overall, this paper provides rich insights into the intricacies of fairness and bias in AI systems through its broad coverage. It can inform both researchers and practitioners working towards equitable and responsible AI.
