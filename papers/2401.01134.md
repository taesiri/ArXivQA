# [Hybrid Pooling and Convolutional Network for Improving Accuracy and   Training Convergence Speed in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01134)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies three main problems with current voxel-based 3D object detection methods:
1) Lack of sufficient pooling steps, affecting model generalizability, performance, robustness and compute requirements.
2) Slow convergence rate during training of two-stage detection models, requiring dozens to hundreds of cycles to achieve good performance. This is not ideal for scenarios requiring short training times.  
3) Significantly decreased detection accuracy for heavily occluded or truncated objects. Accuracy on the KITTI hard set drops 10-15% compared to the easy set.

Proposed Solution - HPC-Net:
The paper proposes a new voxel-based network called HPC-Net to address these challenges. HPC-Net contains three key components:

1) Replaceable Pooling (RP): Performs pooling in both 3D and 2D, compressing features along the Z-axis to generate a BEV image. This enhances accuracy, speed, robustness and generalizability. The pooling method can be flexibly replaced based on task needs.

2) Depth Accelerated Convergence Convolution (DACConv): Integrates a convolution strategy per input feature map and per input channel. This maintains high accuracy while significantly accelerating training convergence.  

3) Multi-Scale Extended Receptive Field Feature Extraction Module (MEFEM): Uses multi-layer deformable convolution and expandable ROI pooling to expand the receptive field and extract features from heavily occluded objects. Also fuses multi-scale feature maps to improve overall detection accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Designed the RP module for flexible 3D and 2D pooling to enhance model performance.  
- Created the DACConv method to achieve much faster convergence without sacrificing accuracy.
- Introduced the MEFEM module to expand receptive fields and fuse multi-scale features, significantly improving detection of occluded objects.  
- HPC-Net achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI dataset, ranking 1st in 2D detection and 4th overall in 3D detection (1st in hard set).


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces HPC-Net, a novel deep learning framework for multimodal 3D object detection that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and convergence speed through innovations in pooling, convolution, and multi-scale feature extraction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

1) A new pooling module called Replaceable Pooling (RP) is proposed. It achieves pooling effects in both 3D and 2D dimensions and allows flexible replacement of pooling methods based on task needs.

2) A Depth Accelerated Convergence Convolution (DACConv) module is introduced. By integrating two convolutional strategies, it greatly accelerates the training convergence speed while maintaining high accuracy. 

3) A Multi-Scale Extended Receptive Field Feature Extraction Module (MEFEM) is devised. By expanding the receptive field area and fusing multi-scale information, it significantly improves the detection accuracy for highly occluded and truncated vehicles.

4) A new network called HPC-Net is invented, which incorporates the above three modules. Experiments show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset, ranking 1st for 2D detection and 4th overall (1st in hard mode) for 3D detection.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) Replaceable Pooling module, (2) Depth Accelerated Convergence Convolution module, (3) Multi-Scale Extended Receptive Field Feature Extraction Module, and (4) The HPC-Net architecture that integrates these modules and achieves new state-of-the-art results.
