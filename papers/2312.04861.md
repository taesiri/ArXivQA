 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of radar data representations and their role in radar perception for autonomous driving systems. The key problem addressed is that there are different radar data representations, each with their own characteristics, but limited existing research explores and compares these representations. The paper aims to provide guidance for researchers on selecting appropriate radar data representations and algorithms for specific autonomous driving perception tasks.

The paper first gives an overview of radar technology principles, including transmission, reception and processing of radar signals to extract information like range, velocity, angle, and Doppler signatures. It then introduces five key radar data representations:

1) ADC signal - the raw radar output signal containing rich temporal information.

2) Radar tensor - a 2D or 3D image-like representation obtained via FFT on the ADC signal, capturing spatial patterns. 

3) Point cloud - sparse 3D points representing radar detections after clutter removal.

4) Grid map - 2D rasterized pseudo-image summarizing radar data for mapping and localization.  

5) Micro-Doppler signature - time-frequency representation capturing micro-motions of targets.

For each representation, the paper systematically examines related datasets, algorithms, advantages and limitations. For example, radar tensors enable efficient perception but retain interference; point clouds provide intuitive spatial data but are susceptible to noise. Thorough discussions are provided on dealing with radar limitations like sparsity and poor resolution. Recent progress in 4D radar sensors is also analyzed. 

The key contributions of this comprehensive review are:

- First work exploring different radar data representations for perception in autonomous driving
