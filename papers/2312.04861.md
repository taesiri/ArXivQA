## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summarizing paragraph for the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of different radar data representations utilized for perception in autonomous driving systems. Five key representations are explored - ADC signals, radar tensors, point clouds, grid maps and micro-Doppler signatures. The review first introduces radar fundamentals including operating principles, signal processing techniques for parameter estimation, and methods to filter clutter. It then examines in detail how each representation is generated from raw radar data, along with contemporary datasets and algorithms leveraging these representations for perception tasks like detection, segmentation, classification and tracking. The relative advantages and limitations of each representation are analyzed regarding aspects such as information content, computational complexity and suitability for certain applications. Key challenges for improving radar perception are identified, including generating high-quality datasets, dealing with inherent sensor limitations, advancing data processing algorithms and handling emerging 4D radar data. Promising research directions are suggested regarding adaptive calibration, graph neural networks, occupancy prediction and efficient models for 4D data. Finally, open questions for multi-modal radar fusion are discussed. Overall, this review offers valuable insights into radar representations for perception, providing guidance on representation selection and algorithm design in autonomous driving research.
