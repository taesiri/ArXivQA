# [Rao-Blackwellising Bayesian Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Bayesian causal inference aims to infer a posterior distribution over causal models in order to quantify uncertainty in downstream causal reasoning tasks. However, performing exact Bayesian inference over entire structural causal models (SCMs) is generally intractable. Most existing work focuses only on causal structure learning rather than full Bayesian causal inference.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a framework that combines techniques from order-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) structure learning and recent differentiable causal structure learning methods. Specifically, they decompose the problem into (1) inferring a topological order over variables and (2) inferring parent sets for each variable conditional on the order. By limiting the parent set size, exhaustive enumeration over parent sets is tractable. Gaussian processes (GPs) are used to model causal mechanisms, enabling analytical integration. 

This effectively Rao-Blackwellizes the model, eliminating all components except the causal order, for which a distribution is learned via gradient-based optimization. The combination of Rao-Blackwellization and the sequential learning procedure results in an effective Bayesian causal inference approach.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a Rao-Blackwellized Bayesian causal inference framework combining order-based structure learning and differentiable methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. 
- Provide analysis relating the quality of importance sampling estimates to properties of proposal distributions over orders and parent sets.
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on linear and nonlinear additive noise benchmarks with scale-free and Erdős–Rényi graphs.
- Highlight the utility of restricted parent sets for exact integration, while still learning expressive proposals.
- Demonstrate a sequential coordinate-ascent inference procedure for improved optimization.
- Provide an open-source implementation to facilitate future research.

In summary, the key innovation is in effectively combining tractable integration over parent sets and flexible learning of proposal distributions over orders to enable high-quality Bayesian causal inference. The proposed techniques help advance the state-of-the-art in this challenging research area.
