# [ImFace: A Nonlinear 3D Morphable Face Model with Implicit Neural   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14510)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing 3D morphable face models (3DMMs) have limitations in accurately modeling complex face shapes and deformations. This is due to:

1) Data discretization and model linearity, which make it difficult to capture accurate identity and expression details. 

2) Reliance on point-to-point correspondence during model building, which remains a challenging problem itself.

3) Most implicit neural representation (INR) methods require watertight input, which is not friendly to common facial surfaces.

Proposed Solution:

The paper proposes a novel INR-based 3DMM called ImFace to address the above limitations. The key ideas are:

1) Explicitly disentangle facial shape variations into two separate deformation fields associated with identity and expression respectively. This allows inter-individual differences and fine-grained deformations to be captured more accurately.

2) Introduce an improved embedding learning strategy to extend expression latent space, enabling modeling of more diverse expression details.

3) Present a Neural Blend-Field to decompose face into semantic local regions encoded by multiple local implicit functions. An adaptive blending module combines them for sophisticated shape representation.  

4) Design effective preprocessing to generate pseudo-watertight faces from raw scans. This enables INRs to work on general facial surfaces without watertight requirement.

Main Contributions:

1) A new nonlinear 3D face model ImFace built with INRs, which leverages explicit disentangled deformation modeling and Neural Blend-Field to represent complex face geometry variations.

2) An improved expression embedding learning approach to expand latent space for finer-grained expression details. 

3) A preprocessing pipeline to enable INRs for the first time to work with non-watertight 3D facial data.

4) Extensive experiments showing ImFace's superiority over state-of-the-arts in tasks like 3D face reconstruction and dense correspondence estimation.

In summary, the paper presents a novel way to create 3D morphable face models using implicit neural representations. The introduced techniques allow more accurate modeling of face shape deformations and work with common non-watertight facial scans.
