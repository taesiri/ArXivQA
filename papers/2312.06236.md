# [Improving Startup Success with Text Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06236)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores predicting startup success using publicly available data from Crunchbase, Google, and Twitter. The authors collect data on over 9,000 companies, including general information, funding history, news articles, search results, and Twitter activity, to generate 171 features. Using machine learning models like CatBoost, they achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting whether a company will raise funding within 1-5 years. The model reaches an F1 score of 0.777 looking 5 years ahead. The top 18 features, led by the company description text, achieve an F1 of 0.718 alone. Compared to previous benchmarks, their model increases precision and F1 scores by over 20 percentage points. Overall, this paper significantly advances startup success prediction through an expanded feature set, especially from textual sources like descriptions and tweets. The adaptable model favors precision or recall and can forecast funding variability into the future. Key limitations are the dataset size and lack of founder and company size features.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Investors want to predict future success of startups to identify promising investment opportunities, but prediction is very difficult due to high uncertainty and risk. 
- Prior approaches relied on structured databases or human computation, but have limitations in capturing soft skills and wisdom of crowds.

Proposed Solution:
- Use publicly available data from Crunchbase, Google Search, and Twitter to extract 171 features spanning general company info, funding events, news articles, web search results, and Twitter activity.
- Apply machine learning models like CatBoost on dataset of 9,842 companies, with 29.7% being successful (raised funding). 
- Features capture hard statistical data as well as soft skills based on textual analysis of news, web content, and tweets.

Key Contributions:
- Created dataset order of magnitude larger than prior academic works.
- New feature set including textual analysis and linguistic metrics (e.g. passive voice) rather than just numerical features. 
- Evaluate 10 ML models with CatBoost achieving best F1 score of 0.736, improving over state-of-the-art (0.531 F1 score).
- Found top 18 features (mostly generic observations) provide most predictive power.
- Flexible model adaptable for predicting funding 1-5 years out with precision/recall tradeoff.
- Further optimized for predicting second funding round, achieving 0.744 precision and 0.730 F1 score.

In summary, the paper significantly advances startup success prediction by using a much larger and diverse dataset, new textual features from public data sources, and rigorous evaluation of multiple ML models. The proposed approach convincingly outperforms prior academic works.
