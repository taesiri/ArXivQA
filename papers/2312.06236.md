# [Improving Startup Success with Text Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06236)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores predicting startup success using publicly available data from Crunchbase, Google, and Twitter. The authors collect data on over 9,000 companies, including general information, funding history, news articles, search results, and Twitter activity, to generate 171 features. Using machine learning models like CatBoost, they achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting whether a company will raise funding within 1-5 years. The model reaches an F1 score of 0.777 looking 5 years ahead. The top 18 features, led by the company description text, achieve an F1 of 0.718 alone. Compared to previous benchmarks, their model increases precision and F1 scores by over 20 percentage points. Overall, this paper significantly advances startup success prediction through an expanded feature set, especially from textual sources like descriptions and tweets. The adaptable model favors precision or recall and can forecast funding variability into the future. Key limitations are the dataset size and lack of founder and company size features.
