# [Explainable AI is Responsible AI: How Explainability Creates Trustworthy   and Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01555)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper conducts a comprehensive literature review to argue that explainable AI (XAI) should be considered the foundation of responsible AI (RAI), rather than just one pillar. The authors review key techniques for achieving explainability in AI systems, both by using inherently interpretable models and by applying post-hoc explainability methods to complex models. They then identify six pillars of responsible AI based on a thorough review of frameworks proposed in academia, industry, and government: fairness, robustness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and safety. By rigorously analyzing recent literature at the intersection of XAI and RAI, the authors demonstrate that XAI techniques can help assess and enhance each of these pillars of responsibility. Explanations reveal issues of bias and unfairness in models, quantify and improve model robustness, make model decisions transparent and accountable, and support privacy-preserving techniques without compromising interpretability. The authors cement their argument through real-world case studies showing how XAI enables responsibility in major AI application areas like generative AI, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles. They conclude that XAI should be considered the foundation on which responsible AI systems are built across sectors and applications where accountability and ethics are paramount.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts a scoping review of explainable AI (XAI) and responsible AI (RAI) literature to demonstrate that XAI should be considered the foundation of RAI rather than just one pillar, providing evidence that XAI supports fairness, robustness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and safety in AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and providing evidence for the novel framework that explainable AI (XAI) is the foundation for responsible AI (RAI), rather than just being one of several pillars. 

Specifically, the key contributions outlined in the paper are:

1) Conducting a broad-scoping review of literature on both XAI and RAI, summarizing key technologies, principles, and frameworks.

2) Proposing and illustrating through evidence that XAI should be considered the foundation of RAI, rather than just one discrete pillar. This is a new perspective not seen in previous works.

3) Demonstrating through exploration of literature that XAI supports the RAI principles of fairness, robustness, transparency, accountability, privacy and safety.

4) Providing real-world use cases in generative AI, healthcare, and transportation that highlight the importance of XAI in developing responsible and trustworthy AI systems.

5) Identifying opportunities for future research in areas such as quantifying responsibility, improving explanations, considering all RAI pillars, and applying XAI to emerging domains like generative AI.

In summary, the key novel contribution is the proposed framework positioning XAI as the foundation for RAI, which is supported through a rigorous review of literature across both fields.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes that explainable AI (XAI) is the foundation for responsible AI (RAI), rather than just one of several pillars. What evidence and reasoning do the authors provide to support this claim? How convincing is their argument?

2. The paper reviews several techniques for achieving explainability, such as LIME, SHAP, and CAM. How suitable are these different techniques for supporting the various pillars of responsibility like fairness, accountability, and safety? Are certain XAI methods better suited for certain principles?

3. The paper argues governments are leading academia and industry in pushing for responsible AI adoption. What evidence supports this claim? Why might governments be more proactive than other institutions in this area? What are the strengths and limitations of government-led approaches?

4. The paper proposes six pillars of responsibility - fairness, robustness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and safety. Are there any other pillars that could or should be considered foundational? Why or why not? How would additional pillars change the role of XAI?

5. For each of the six pillars discussed, what metrics could be used to quantify whether an AI system achieves that principle? What challenges exist in quantifying these abstract concepts? 

6. How could explanations provided by AI systems be evaluated to ensure they genuinely improve human understanding and trust? What evidence exists on human mental models and requirements for explainability?

7. The paper presents several use cases applying XAI for RAI - generative AI, diagnostics, and autonomous vehicles. What other promising use cases exist where explainability is critical for responsibility? What unique requirements or challenges may they present?

8. What techniques could make explanations more responsible - for example, by considering multiple pillars of RAI at once? How should trade-offs between pillars like transparency and privacy be managed?

9. For a safety-critical application like healthcare, what evidence suggests current XAI methods lead to suitably responsible systems? What assurances are still needed before wide deployment?

10. The paper focuses on technical solutions for responsibility, but what about evaluation by domain experts, ethical oversight committees, consumer advocacy groups etc.? How essential are these social mechanisms vs technical XAI solutions?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have immense potential to revolutionize fields like healthcare and finance if developed responsibly. However, irresponsible AI can perpetuate biases, threaten privacy, spread misinformation, and even harm individuals. This has led to increasing interest in responsible AI (RAI), which aims to ensure AI benefits humanity through principles like fairness, robustness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and safety. Explainable AI (XAI) can reveal the inner workings of AI models, which suggests it may support RAI, however the precise relationship has not been thoroughly investigated.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper conducts a broad review of XAI and RAI research and finds strong evidence that XAI should be considered the foundation of RAI rather than one of its pillars. The authors illustrate how XAI enables assessment of RAI's pillars of fairness, robustness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and safety. For example, XAI tools like SHAP reveal biases so models can be corrected, support accountability through model auditing, and enable implementation of privacy measures without compromising interpretability. Based on the analysis, the authors propose a novel framework with XAI as central to achieving RAI.

Main Contributions:
- Identification of 6 key pillars of responsible AI based on a review of academic, industry and government sources
- Proposal of a new framework with XAI as the foundation for achieving responsible AI, contrasting frameworks where XAI is one pillar 
- Evidence across the 6 pillars illustrating how XAI enables assessment and enhancement of fairness, robustness, transparency, accountability, privacy and safety
- Practical demonstrations of how XAI supports responsible AI development in priority domains like generative AI, healthcare diagnostics, and autonomous vehicles
- Outline of key opportunities for advancing research into explainable and responsible AI systems

In summary, this paper makes a strong argument through detailed analysis that explainability is essential for developing responsible AI that benefits humanity. The central role of XAI proposed has significant implications for future RAI research and development.
