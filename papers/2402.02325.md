# [Role of Momentum in Smoothing Objective Function in Implicit Graduated   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02325)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum is commonly used in deep learning, but there is a lack of theoretical understanding of why it converges faster and has better generalizability than vanilla SGD. Specifically, the roles of momentum, batch size, and learning rate are not well understood.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper analyzes SGD and SGD with momentum (specifically stochastic heavy ball (SHB) and normalized SHB (NSHB)) theoretically. It derives formulas to estimate the "critical batch size" and variance of the stochastic gradients.

- It shows SGD and SGD with momentum have a "smoothing" effect on the objective function. The degree of smoothing depends on momentum factor, learning rate, batch size, stochastic gradient variance, and gradient norm bound. Larger values smooth more. 

- This smoothing effect avoids sharp minimizers and leads to flat minimizers that generalize better. It explains why momentum helps generalization. The degree of smoothing also explains the interplay between batch size, learning rate and momentum.

- Based on the smoothing view, the paper develops "implicit graduated optimization" algorithms that slowly reduce smoothing (by reducing learning rate and/or momentum) over training.

Main Contributions:

- First paper to provide formulas to estimate critical batch size and stochastic gradient variance for SGD and SGD with momentum

- Provides theoretical evidence that SGD with momentum smooths objective function more than vanilla SGD

- Explains role of momentum for generalization based on smoothing view

- Explains interplay between batch size, learning rate and momentum based on degree of smoothing 

- Develops new "implicit graduated optimization" methods that leverage smoothing properties to find flatter minimizers that generalize better

- Testing shows proposed methods outperform constant parameter SGD with momentum on image classification tasks

In summary, the paper provides useful theoretical and practical insights into why SGD with momentum works well, especially for generalization, and proposes new algorithms based on the smoothing perspective.
