# [Towards Knowledge-Grounded Natural Language Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have advanced the state-of-the-art in NLP. However, they still face challenges in knowledge-intensive tasks requiring reasoning with facts and common sense knowledge.

- Explicit factual knowledge, such as that in knowledge bases (KBs) and Wikipedia, needs to be integrated to enhance language models.

Proposed Solutions - Knowledge Integration Techniques:

1. Adding Entity Embeddings
    - Identify entities in text and incorporate pre-trained entity embeddings from KBs like Wikidata to enhance token embeddings. Models: ERNIE, KnowBert, K-BERT.

2. Using External Memory
    - Condition language models on factual KBs stored in a key-value memory, allowing seamless knowledge integration and updates. Models: KGLM, KNN-LM.  

3. Adding Auxiliary Pre-training Tasks 
    - Design additional self-supervised objectives requiring reasoning over facts in KBs, and multi-task with language modeling. Models: WKLM, KEPLER.

4. Adding Adapters
    - Add smaller trainable adapter layers to inject knowledge without re-training the entire LM. Specialise adapters for different knowledge types. Model: K-ADAPTER.
    
5. Retrieval Augmentation
    - Introduce a retriever to dynamically retrieve relevant knowledge passages/KB subgraphs at runtime for conditioning. Enables efficient knowledge expansion. Models: RAG, REALM.

Main Contributions:

- Provides a structured categorisation and review of techniques to enhance language model capabilities with external explicit knowledge.

- Comprehensively summarises background on transformers, knowledge sources, and existing knowledge-infused language models.

- The taxonomy of knowledge integration approaches serves as a framework to situate new research innovations in this rapidly evolving field.

In summary, this paper delivers a holistic overview of the problem context, landscape of solutions, and key innovations in knowledge-enhanced language modeling for more capable and reliable NLP systems.
