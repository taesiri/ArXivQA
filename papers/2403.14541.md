# [EDT: Improving Large Language Models' Generation by Entropy-based   Dynamic Temperature Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language generation tasks. Temperature sampling is commonly used during decoding to control the tradeoff between quality and diversity. 
- However, most methods use a fixed temperature, which is suboptimal. The optimal temperature varies across instances and decoding steps.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an entropy-based dynamic temperature (EDT) sampling method to dynamically select the temperature during decoding. 
- EDT measures the model's confidence at each step using the entropy of the token probability distribution. Higher entropy indicates less confidence.
- The temperature is adjusted at each step based on the entropy using a simple formula, allowing more exploration when the model is less confident.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis showing limitations of fixed temperatures and benefits of dynamic temperatures.
- Novel EDT method to dynamically select temperature based on model confidence measured by entropy.
- Experiments on summarization, QA, and translation tasks showing EDT outperforms fixed and existing dynamic temperatures.
- EDT achieves better balance of quality and diversity. It is simple, efficient, and task-agnostic.
- Analysis of the impact of key hyperparameters and design choices.

In summary, the paper presents an effective dynamic temperature sampling method for LLM decoding that can improve both quality and diversity over fixed temperature baselines. The method is model-agnostic and shows strong performance across diverse language generation tasks.
