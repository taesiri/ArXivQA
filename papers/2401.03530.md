# [Detecting Anomalies in Blockchain Transactions using Machine Learning   Classifiers and Explainability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03530)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Detecting anomalies in blockchain transactions like Bitcoin is important to identify malicious activities, but it is challenging due to the highly imbalanced distribution between normal and anomalous transactions. 
- Existing methods struggle with this imbalance and fail to accurately detect anomalies. Also, there is a lack of explainability of model predictions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using tree-based ensemble classifiers with explainable AI techniques to detect blockchain transaction anomalies.
- They introduce a new under-sampling algorithm called XGBCLUS to balance the classes in the imbalanced training data.
- The predictions of stacking and voting ensemble models are explained using SHAP values and anomaly rules from decision trees.

Key Contributions:
- Development of XGBCLUS under-sampling method which shows higher TPR and lower FPR than state-of-the-art techniques.
- Exploration of various over-sampling and combined sampling methods for balancing.
- Comparison of single ML classifiers versus stacking and voting ensembles revealing superior performance of ensembles for accuracy, TPR and FPR.  
- Incorporation of model explainability using SHAP to highlight important features and generation of interpretable anomaly rules from decision trees.
- The proposed solution with ensemble models, XGBCLUS under-sampling and explainability analysis significantly improves anomaly detection in blockchain transactions.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in handling imbalanced blockchain data, detecting anomalies accurately, and explaining model predictions - advancing the state-of-the-art in this domain. The proposed techniques have broader implications for security and interpretability of ML models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using explainable AI techniques and ensemble machine learning classifiers with a novel undersampling method called XGBCLUS to detect anomalies in imbalanced Bitcoin transaction data with improved performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors propose a new under-sampling algorithm called XGBCLUS to balance the anomalous and non-anomalous transaction data. This algorithm performs better than other state-of-the-art under-sampling methods in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and ROC-AUC scores.

2) The authors explore both under-sampling and over-sampling techniques for handling class imbalance when detecting anomalous Bitcoin transactions. A comparative analysis is provided to analyze the trade-offs between these approaches.

3) The authors propose stacked and voting ensemble classifiers which outperform individual tree-based machine learning models in accurately detecting anomalous transactions, especially in terms of accuracy and false positive rate.

4) The authors incorporate explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically the SHAP method and decision tree-based anomaly rules, to increase interpretability and provide transparency into why certain transactions are classified as anomalous. This addresses a key limitation of previous works lacking explainability.

5) Overall, the combination of suitable sampling techniques, ensemble classifiers, and XAI methods leads to an effective approach for detecting anomalies in highly imbalanced blockchain transaction data.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of sampling strategies, ensemble learning, and explainable AI to enhance anomaly detection in blockchain networks. Both performance metrics and interpretability are improved through the proposed techniques.

The paper focuses on detecting anomalies in Bitcoin transactions using machine learning classifiers and explainability analysis. It handles the data imbalance issue in Bitcoin transactions using different sampling techniques like the proposed XGBCLUS algorithm. It also compares single machine learning classifiers with ensemble classifiers for anomaly detection and uses the SHAP method under explainable AI to provide transparency into the model's predictions.
