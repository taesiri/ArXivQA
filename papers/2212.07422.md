# [ECON: Explicit Clothed humans Optimized via Normal integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07422)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces ECON, a new method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single color image. The key research question it addresses is: How can we combine the benefits of implicit function-based reconstruction (flexibility to model arbitrary shapes/topologies) with explicit body model regularization (robustness to pose variation) to get the "best of both worlds" for reconstructing clothed humans?The main hypothesis is that decomposing the problem into:1) Inferring detailed front/back normal maps 2) Converting these to partial front/back surfaces guided by a body model3) Completing the full shape by "inpainting" the missing parts will allow leveraging the strengths of both implicit surfaces and explicit body models to reconstruct high-fidelity clothed humans, even in challenging poses or loose clothing.In summary, the paper introduces a new "hybrid" approach called ECON that combines implicit functions and explicit body models in a novel way to push the state-of-the-art in robust and detailed image-based human digitization. The key innovation is in the problem decomposition and integration of different 3D representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is a new method called ECON (Explicit Clothed humans Optimized via Normal integration) for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single RGB image. The key ideas are:- Leveraging the complementary strengths of implicit neural representations and explicit parametric body models. Implicit functions like PIFu can represent complex topology like clothing, but struggle with novel poses. Explicit models like SMPL-X are more robust, but limited in modeling loose clothing. - Decomposing the problem into: (1) predicting detailed front and back normal maps, (2) reconstructing partial front and back surfaces by combining the normals with a coarse SMPL-X shape prior, (3) completing the full shape by "inpainting" the missing regions between the partial surfaces.- A new optimisation method called depth-aware silhouette-consistent bilateral normal integration (d-BiNI) to convert the predicted normals into coherent partial surfaces using the SMPL-X body as a guide.- Adapting existing shape completion techniques like IF-Nets to be conditioned on SMPL-X to fill in missing regions in a realistic way.In summary, ECON combines pixel-aligned implicit function prediction, explicit body regularization, and tailored shape completion to get state-of-the-art results in reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images. The method is robust to challenging poses while preserving clothing details.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: The paper proposes ECON, a new method for reconstructing detailed 3D humans from a single color image, which combines implicit free-form surface representations with an explicit parametric body model to get the benefits of both approaches - robustness to challenging poses while still capturing loose clothing details.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in image-based 3D human reconstruction:- It combines implicit surface representation with explicit body regularization, aiming to get the benefits of both approaches. Many other methods rely purely on either implicit functions or explicit body models. - The approach reconstructs detailed front and back surfaces from predicted normal maps, then completes the full shape with shape inpainting. This is a unique pipeline compared to other end-to-end learning methods.- It leverages recent advances like bilateral normal integration and IF-Nets for the different stages of the pipeline. This allows building on state-of-the-art techniques.- The experiments show superior performance over other methods like PaMIR, ICON, and PIFuHD on challenging poses and loose clothing. This demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach. - The approach is robust to novel poses and clothing topologies thanks to the flexible implicit surface representation. Many other methods struggle with generalization.- It can reconstruct high frequency detail from the normal maps while also having anthropomorphic shape regularity. Some other methods tend to over-smooth details or produce artifacts.- The qualitative results show successful reconstructions even in very challenging cases with extreme poses and loose clothing. This highlights the robustness of the approach.In summary, the key differentiating aspects are the hybrid implicit/explicit representation, the surface-inpainting pipeline, strong generalization ability, and high-quality reconstructions. The experiments and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods highlight these advantages.
