# [ECON: Explicit Clothed humans Optimized via Normal integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07422)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces ECON, a new method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single color image. The key research question it addresses is: How can we combine the benefits of implicit function-based reconstruction (flexibility to model arbitrary shapes/topologies) with explicit body model regularization (robustness to pose variation) to get the "best of both worlds" for reconstructing clothed humans?The main hypothesis is that decomposing the problem into:1) Inferring detailed front/back normal maps 2) Converting these to partial front/back surfaces guided by a body model3) Completing the full shape by "inpainting" the missing parts will allow leveraging the strengths of both implicit surfaces and explicit body models to reconstruct high-fidelity clothed humans, even in challenging poses or loose clothing.In summary, the paper introduces a new "hybrid" approach called ECON that combines implicit functions and explicit body models in a novel way to push the state-of-the-art in robust and detailed image-based human digitization. The key innovation is in the problem decomposition and integration of different 3D representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is a new method called ECON (Explicit Clothed humans Optimized via Normal integration) for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single RGB image. The key ideas are:- Leveraging the complementary strengths of implicit neural representations and explicit parametric body models. Implicit functions like PIFu can represent complex topology like clothing, but struggle with novel poses. Explicit models like SMPL-X are more robust, but limited in modeling loose clothing. - Decomposing the problem into: (1) predicting detailed front and back normal maps, (2) reconstructing partial front and back surfaces by combining the normals with a coarse SMPL-X shape prior, (3) completing the full shape by "inpainting" the missing regions between the partial surfaces.- A new optimisation method called depth-aware silhouette-consistent bilateral normal integration (d-BiNI) to convert the predicted normals into coherent partial surfaces using the SMPL-X body as a guide.- Adapting existing shape completion techniques like IF-Nets to be conditioned on SMPL-X to fill in missing regions in a realistic way.In summary, ECON combines pixel-aligned implicit function prediction, explicit body regularization, and tailored shape completion to get state-of-the-art results in reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images. The method is robust to challenging poses while preserving clothing details.
