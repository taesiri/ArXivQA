# [ECON: Explicit Clothed humans Optimized via Normal integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07422)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper introduces ECON, a new method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single color image. The key research question it addresses is: 

How can we combine the benefits of implicit function-based reconstruction (flexibility to model arbitrary shapes/topologies) with explicit body model regularization (robustness to pose variation) to get the "best of both worlds" for reconstructing clothed humans?

The main hypothesis is that decomposing the problem into:

1) Inferring detailed front/back normal maps 
2) Converting these to partial front/back surfaces guided by a body model
3) Completing the full shape by "inpainting" the missing parts 

will allow leveraging the strengths of both implicit surfaces and explicit body models to reconstruct high-fidelity clothed humans, even in challenging poses or loose clothing.

In summary, the paper introduces a new "hybrid" approach called ECON that combines implicit functions and explicit body models in a novel way to push the state-of-the-art in robust and detailed image-based human digitization. The key innovation is in the problem decomposition and integration of different 3D representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is a new method called ECON (Explicit Clothed humans Optimized via Normal integration) for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single RGB image. The key ideas are:

- Leveraging the complementary strengths of implicit neural representations and explicit parametric body models. Implicit functions like PIFu can represent complex topology like clothing, but struggle with novel poses. Explicit models like SMPL-X are more robust, but limited in modeling loose clothing. 

- Decomposing the problem into: (1) predicting detailed front and back normal maps, (2) reconstructing partial front and back surfaces by combining the normals with a coarse SMPL-X shape prior, (3) completing the full shape by "inpainting" the missing regions between the partial surfaces.

- A new optimisation method called depth-aware silhouette-consistent bilateral normal integration (d-BiNI) to convert the predicted normals into coherent partial surfaces using the SMPL-X body as a guide.

- Adapting existing shape completion techniques like IF-Nets to be conditioned on SMPL-X to fill in missing regions in a realistic way.

In summary, ECON combines pixel-aligned implicit function prediction, explicit body regularization, and tailored shape completion to get state-of-the-art results in reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images. The method is robust to challenging poses while preserving clothing details.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes ECON, a new method for reconstructing detailed 3D humans from a single color image, which combines implicit free-form surface representations with an explicit parametric body model to get the benefits of both approaches - robustness to challenging poses while still capturing loose clothing details.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in image-based 3D human reconstruction:

- It combines implicit surface representation with explicit body regularization, aiming to get the benefits of both approaches. Many other methods rely purely on either implicit functions or explicit body models. 

- The approach reconstructs detailed front and back surfaces from predicted normal maps, then completes the full shape with shape inpainting. This is a unique pipeline compared to other end-to-end learning methods.

- It leverages recent advances like bilateral normal integration and IF-Nets for the different stages of the pipeline. This allows building on state-of-the-art techniques.

- The experiments show superior performance over other methods like PaMIR, ICON, and PIFuHD on challenging poses and loose clothing. This demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach. 

- The approach is robust to novel poses and clothing topologies thanks to the flexible implicit surface representation. Many other methods struggle with generalization.

- It can reconstruct high frequency detail from the normal maps while also having anthropomorphic shape regularity. Some other methods tend to over-smooth details or produce artifacts.

- The qualitative results show successful reconstructions even in very challenging cases with extreme poses and loose clothing. This highlights the robustness of the approach.

In summary, the key differentiating aspects are the hybrid implicit/explicit representation, the surface-inpainting pipeline, strong generalization ability, and high-quality reconstructions. The experiments and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods highlight these advantages.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Recovering additional avatar parameters beyond just 3D geometry, like an underlying skeleton and skinning weights, to obtain fully-animatable avatars that can be posed and moved.

- Generating back-view texture maps to complement the reconstructed 3D geometry, resulting in fully-textured avatars. 

- Disentangling different aspects of the recovered avatars, like clothing, hairstyle, accessories etc., to enable editing and transfer of these styles.

- Using the reconstructed avatars and underlying SMPL body models as shape priors to train neural avatars and generative models for clothed 3D humans.

- Applying the method to augment existing large-scale 2D image datasets with reconstructed 3D humans, to facilitate training of downstream tasks like pose estimation, avatar generation, etc.

- Addressing limitations of the current method, like reliance on accurate SMPL body estimation and normal map prediction, to improve robustness.

- Exploring conditional training of the networks on synthetic data to improve generalization.

- Incorporating dynamic representations to model cloth deformation and motion.

- Extending to video input to exploit temporal information.

So in summary, the authors propose directions like recovering more avatar parameters, disentangling aspects of shape, using the reconstructions to improve generative models and downstream tasks, addressing current limitations, and extending to video input as promising future work. The overall goal is to enable detailed and realistic avatar creation from images/video.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents ECON, a method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single color image. ECON combines the strengths of implicit surface representations with explicit body model regularization. It has three main steps: (1) It predicts detailed front and back normal maps from the input image conditioned on a SMPL-X body estimate. (2) It converts the normals into incomplete front and back surfaces using a novel bilateral normal integration method tailored for humans. This aligns the surfaces with the SMPL-X body. (3) It completes the full 3D shape by "inpainting" the missing regions between the front and back surfaces using an adapted version of IF-Nets. ECON produces high-fidelity clothed human shapes that are robust to challenging poses and loose clothing. Experiments show it outperforms previous methods on the CAPE and RenderPeople datasets quantitatively and in perceptual studies. A key advantage is the method's ability to leverage 2D convolutional networks to predict detailed maps which are then assembled into full 3D surfaces in a robust way guided by the body model.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes ECON, a new method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single color image. The method combines implicit shape representations with explicit body regularization to get the benefits of both approaches. Implicit functions can represent arbitrary topologies like loose clothing, while the explicit body model provides robustness to novel poses. 

ECON has three main steps. First, it predicts detailed front and back normal maps from the input image, conditioned on a SMPL-X body estimate. Second, it converts the normal maps into incomplete front and back surfaces using a novel bilateral normal integration method. This produces detailed surfaces that are aligned with the SMPL-X body. Third, it completes the full 3D shape by inpainting the missing regions between the front and back surfaces using an adapted implicit function network. The final output is a complete 3D mesh of the clothed human. Experiments show ECON produces more accurate and detailed results than previous methods, especially for challenging poses and loose clothing. A perceptual study also shows people find the results more realistic than other state-of-the-art methods.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes ECON, a method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single RGB image. ECON combines implicit function networks with explicit body model regularization to get the benefits of both approaches. It has three main steps: (1) It predicts detailed front and back normal maps from the input image conditioned on a SMPL-X body estimate. (2) It converts the normal maps into incomplete but detailed front and back surfaces using a novel bilateral normal integration method called d-BNI that aligns the surfaces with the SMPL-X body. (3) It completes the full 3D shape by "inpainting" the missing regions between the front and back surfaces using an adapted version of IF-Nets conditioned on the SMPL-X body. As a result, ECON produces high-fidelity 3D human reconstructions with realistic clothing details and robustness to challenging poses, going beyond previous methods according to quantitative and perceptual evaluations. The key aspects are the normal map prediction, the d-BNI surface reconstruction that links normals with the body model, and the adapted shape completion network.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of reconstructing detailed 3D clothed human models from a single color image. Specifically, it aims to combine the benefits of both implicit free-form shape representation and explicit body model regularization to produce high-fidelity 3D human reconstructions.

The key questions/challenges it aims to address are:

- How to leverage implicit functions to represent free-form shapes like loose clothing while still maintaining robustness to different poses? Existing implicit methods like PIFuHD struggle with novel poses.

- How to incorporate an explicit body model like SMPL-X to regularize the shape reconstruction and handle challenging poses, without over-constraining the shape topology and losing details? Methods using SMPL-X tend to over-smooth clothing details. 

- How to get the best of both worlds - the flexibility of implicit functions and robustness of body models?

To summarize, the main goal is developing a method that can reconstruct high-quality 3D clothed humans from images, with both robustness to pose variations and ability to represent detailed geometry like clothing wrinkles. The key is effectively combining implicit functions and body models.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ECON, a method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single color image. The key idea is to combine the strengths of implicit functions (IFs) with explicit body representations. IFs can represent arbitrary topology but struggle with novel poses, while body models provide pose robustness but restrict topology. ECON first predicts detailed front and back normal maps using an image-to-image translation network conditioned on a SMPL-X body estimate. These maps are converted to partial 3D surfaces using a tailored bilateral normal integration method. This produces detailed yet incomplete front and back surfaces aligned to the body model. To complete the full shape, ECON uses an adapted IF-Net+ model conditioned on SMPL-X to implicitly fill in missing regions between the partial surfaces. Finally, screened Poisson surface reconstruction stitches the partial surfaces and filled regions into a complete watertight 3D human. Experiments show ECON reconstructs high-fidelity clothed humans even for challenging poses and loose clothing. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CAPE and RenderPeople datasets. A perceptual study also shows ECON has significantly higher realism on difficult cases and is competitive on fashion images. The main limitations are failures in body estimation or normal map prediction. Overall, ECON combines the strengths of data-driven implicit functions and body models for robust detailed clothed human digitization.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes ECON, a method for reconstructing detailed 3D clothed humans from a single color image. The key idea is to combine the strengths of implicit functions and explicit body models. ECON first predicts front and back normal maps of the clothed human using an image-to-image translation network conditioned on a SMPL-X body estimate. These normal maps are then converted into partial front and back surfaces using a tailored bilateral normal integration approach that accounts for depth and silhouette consistency with the body model. Finally, the missing geometry between the partial surfaces is inpainted using a learned implicit function conditioned on SMPL-X. This allows ECON to capture free-form geometry like clothing details, while still being constrained by the body model to produce coherent human shapes even for challenging poses. Experiments show that ECON achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on benchmarks and generalizes well to in-the-wild images. A user study also shows it generates more realistic results than previous methods.
