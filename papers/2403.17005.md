# [TRIP: Temporal Residual Learning with Image Noise Prior for   Image-to-Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17005)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the challenging problem of image-to-video (I2V) generation, where the goal is to animate a given static image into a realistic video based on a text prompt. I2V generation is difficult because the generated video frames should not only faithfully align with the given image but also maintain temporal coherence among the frames. Existing I2V methods fail to effectively establish the inter-frame relations, leading to temporally incoherent results.

Method:
The paper proposes a new diffusion model called TRIP (Temporal Residual learning with Image noise Prior) to address the above issues in I2V generation. The key idea is to formulate the typical noise prediction in diffusion models as temporal residual learning with respect to an image noise prior derived from the given static image. Specifically, TRIP performs residual-like noise prediction along two pathways:

1) Shortcut path: Computes the image noise prior based on the given image and noised video latent codes. The image noise prior acts as the reference noise to enhance alignment between frames. 

2) Residual path: A 3D UNet predicts the residual noise by reasoning inter-frame relations. Residual learning eases temporal modeling among frames.

Finally, a Transformer-based temporal fusion module dynamically merges the reference and residual noises as the target noise for video generation.

Contributions:
The main contributions are:

1) Proposes a new residual-like formulation for I2V generation to exploit inter-frame relations by learning an image noise prior.

2) Designs a shortcut path to compute the image noise prior and use it as reference to amplify visual alignment between frames.

3) Develops a residual path for eased temporal modeling and a transformer fusion module for noise prediction.

Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance of TRIP over state-of-the-art I2V approaches, highlighting its ability to generate temporally coherent videos with high visual quality.
