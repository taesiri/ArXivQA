# [Compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting for Accelerated Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Novel view synthesis aims to generate new views of a 3D scene from a sparse set of images, but methods like NeRF are slow to train and render, while using explicit scene representations (voxels, points) improves speed but requires lots of memory. 
- Recently, differentiable 3D Gaussian splatting was proposed for high quality and efficient novel view synthesis, but still requires multiple GBs of storage, making it difficult to render on low-end devices with limited memory.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a compression pipeline to compress 3D Gaussian scenes by up to 31x with minimal loss of quality.
- Use sensitivity-aware vector quantization to cluster color (SH) coefficients and Gaussian shape parameters (rotation, scale) into compact codebooks.
- Fine-tune clustered scene with quantization-aware training to regain lost information. Quantize parameters to 8-bit.  
- Linearize Gaussians along space-filling curve and use entropy encoding to exploit spatial coherence.
- Render compressed scene using GPU rasterization rather than compute shader for up to 4x speedup.

Main Contributions:
- Sensitivity-aware vector quantization scheme to compress 3D Gaussian scenes by up to 31x.
- Quantization-aware fine-tuning to regain visual quality at low bitrates.
- GPU rasterization renderer for compressed scenes enabling real-time novel view synthesis even on low-end devices.  
- State-of-the-art quality at significantly reduced memory consumption and up to 4x higher frame rates compared to previous 3D Gaussian splatting work.
- Enables applications like network streaming and rendering on memory constrained devices like handhelds and head-mounted displays.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to compress 3D Gaussian scene representations for novel view synthesis by 31x through sensitivity-aware clustering, quantization-aware training, and entropy encoding while achieving 4x faster rendering via GPU rasterization with minimal loss of visual quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel compression and rendering pipeline for 3D Gaussian scene representations used in novel view synthesis. Specifically:

1) A compression method is proposed that can reduce the storage requirements of typical 3D Gaussian scenes by up to 31x. The compression utilizes sensitivity-aware vector quantization, quantization-aware fine-tuning, and entropy encoding to compress the color, shape, and other parameters of the Gaussians.

2) A new renderer for the compressed Gaussian scenes is introduced that utilizes GPU sorting and rasterization to enable real-time novel view synthesis even on low-power devices. This results in up to 4x higher rendering speeds compared to prior work.  

3) Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality novel view rendering with the compressed scenes across multiple datasets. The compressed representations enable applications like network streaming and rendering on resource-constrained devices like mobile VR/AR headsets.

In summary, the key innovation is a full pipeline for compressing and efficiently rendering 3D Gaussian scenes to enable novel view synthesis applications that were previously prohibited by the high memory bandwidth requirements.
