# [Is MAP Decoding All You Need? The Inadequacy of the Mode in Neural   Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10283)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is whether maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding, which aims to find the most likely translation, is adequate for neural machine translation (NMT) systems trained with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The paper argues that many of the known problems or pathologies with NMT, such as length bias and the beam search curse, are actually due to the inadequacy of MAP decoding rather than inherent flaws with the NMT model or MLE training. The authors contend that the probability distributions learned by MLE capture important aspects of translation well in expectation, but MAP decoding fails to utilize the full distribution.So in summary, the main question is whether MAP decoding is suitable for MLE-trained NMT systems, or whether alternative decoding methods that consider the full learned distribution would be better. The paper aims to show empirically that the model and training are reasonable, but MAP decoding contributes to observed problems.
