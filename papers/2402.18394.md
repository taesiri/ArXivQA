# [Dual-IMU State Estimation for Relative Localization of Two Mobile Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of relative localization between two mobile agents, each equipped with an IMU sensor. Specifically, it considers the most general case where the motion and IMU biases of both agents are unknown. Existing works have limitations such as assuming known motion or ignoring some IMU biases. Accurate estimation of the relative pose and motion between the agents under unknown conditions remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a dual-IMU system that jointly estimates the relative pose, velocity and all four IMU biases by fusing measurements from both IMUs. It derives the system's continuous-time state propagation model and measurement models. The system employs an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for state estimation.

Main Contributions:
1) Presents the dual-IMU system model for joint estimation of relative state and all IMU biases, in the most general unknown case.  

2) Conducts a nonlinear observability analysis to prove the system is observable under general motion, using the concept of Lie derivatives.

3) Identifies unobservable directions under various types of special motions and provides physical interpretations. Relative orientation becomes unobservable for certain motions.

4) Validates key findings on observability and examines impact on estimation accuracy and consistency through extensive simulations.  

5) Demonstrates a real-world implementation for relative localization between an AR glasses worn by a person and a moving vehicle, using only two low-cost IMUs. The system runs efficiently in real-time.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel estimation framework for IMU-based relative localization and provides valuable analytical and experimental insights into its observability properties and estimation performance.
