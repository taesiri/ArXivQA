# [HQA-Attack: Toward High Quality Black-Box Hard-Label Adversarial Attack   on Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01806)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating high-quality textual adversarial examples under black-box hard-label attack settings is challenging. Existing methods rely on complex heuristics or unreliable gradient estimations, easily falling into local optima and consuming excessive queries. This results in unsatisfactory attack performance in terms of semantic similarity, perturbation rate and query efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes HQA-Attack, a simple yet effective framework to generate high quality adversarial text examples under black-box hard-label settings. The key ideas are:

(1) Initialize an adversarial example randomly, then constantly substitute original words back to shrink perturbation rate. 

(2) For remaining changed words, leverage their synonym sets to optimize the adversarial example. Specifically, find a transition synonym word first to avoid traversing the whole set. Then estimate an updating direction that can improve semantic similarity and satisfy adversarial condition simultaneously.  

(3) Sequentially search around the transition word to update the adversarial example, avoiding unnecessary queries.

Main Contributions:

- Propose a novel substitution-optimization framework for black-box hard-label attack, which can generate adversarial text with higher semantic similarity and lower perturbation rate under tight query budgets.

- Introduce an efficient transition word searching and updating direction estimation strategy, significantly reducing the number of queries required.

- Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and real-world APIs demonstrate superior attack performance over state-of-the-art methods. The framework is simple, fast and effective.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in black-box adversarial attacks on discrete text data. By shrinking perturbation while improving semantic similarity, it takes a solid step towards crafted textual adversarial examples of higher quality. The transition word and updating direction techniques also showcase improved query efficiency.
