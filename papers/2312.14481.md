# [Part to Whole: Collaborative Prompting for Surgical Instrument   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for surgical instrument segmentation rely on developing specialist models that require full training of parameters, incurring high costs. They also lack human-computer interactivity desired in surgery.  
- While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables interactive segmentation, directly applying it to surgical instruments is challenging due to: (1) Reliance on impractical per-frame point/box prompts; (2) Insufficient surgical data and inability to capture complex structures of surgical instruments.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose SP-SAM, an efficient tuning approach of SAM for text promptable surgical instrument segmentation.
- Introduce "collaborative prompts" that combine instrument category and part information (e.g. "[part name] of [category name]"). Decomposes instruments into fine-grained parts.
- Propose Cross-Modal Prompt Encoder to encode collaborative prompts into discriminative part-level representations through visual-textual interaction. Focuses on subtle part details.  
- Devise Part-to-Whole Selective Fusion to adaptively assemble part representations into whole representation using category-specific and image-specific part weights.
- Perform Hierarchical Decoding of both whole instrument and individual parts to enhance understanding at both holistic and part levels.

Main Contributions:
- Achieve SOTA performance on EndoVis2018 and EndoVis2017 datasets with only 8.62M tunable parameters, significantly lower than specialist models.
- Introduce collaborative prompts and Cross-Modal Prompt Encoder to focus on learning fine-grained part details.
- Propose Part-to-Whole Selective Fusion and Hierarchical Decoding to explicitly incorporate surgical instrument structure knowledge into the model.
