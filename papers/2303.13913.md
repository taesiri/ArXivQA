# [GarmentTracking: Category-Level Garment Pose Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13913)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we track the pose of garments in videos, in a category-level manner?

The key aspects of this research question are:

- Pose tracking of garments: Estimating the complete 3D shape and configuration of garments over time in a video. This is challenging due to the complex deformations and self-occlusions of garments.

- Category-level: The method aims to work on novel garment categories not seen during training. This requires learning representations that can generalize across garment types rather than just memorizing shapes.

- Videos: The research focuses on the sequential tracking setting, leveraging temporal information across frames rather than just single image pose estimation.

To summarize, the paper proposes a category-level garment pose tracking method that can estimate the complete time-varying 3D pose of garments in videos, even for garment categories not seen during training. The core research question is how to design a model that can learn generalized garment pose representations and effectively leverage temporal information for accurate sequential tracking.
