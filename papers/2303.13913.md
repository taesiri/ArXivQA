# [GarmentTracking: Category-Level Garment Pose Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13913)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we track the pose of garments in videos, in a category-level manner?

The key aspects of this research question are:

- Pose tracking of garments: Estimating the complete 3D shape and configuration of garments over time in a video. This is challenging due to the complex deformations and self-occlusions of garments.

- Category-level: The method aims to work on novel garment categories not seen during training. This requires learning representations that can generalize across garment types rather than just memorizing shapes.

- Videos: The research focuses on the sequential tracking setting, leveraging temporal information across frames rather than just single image pose estimation.

To summarize, the paper proposes a category-level garment pose tracking method that can estimate the complete time-varying 3D pose of garments in videos, even for garment categories not seen during training. The core research question is how to design a model that can learn generalized garment pose representations and effectively leverage temporal information for accurate sequential tracking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. They propose a VR-based garment manipulation recording system called VR-Garment. This allows collecting a large-scale dataset with complex garment poses and annotations. 

2. They create a new dataset called VR-Folding for garment pose tracking. It contains about 100k videos of garment manipulation with 790K frames annotated with garment pose, hand pose, etc. The dataset focuses on two tasks - flattening and folding.

3. They propose an end-to-end framework called GarmentTracking for category-level garment pose tracking. It takes point cloud sequences as input and predicts complete garment geometry with inter-frame correspondence. The method operates in three stages - NOCS prediction, NOCS refinement, and canonical to task space mapping.

4. They demonstrate the effectiveness of GarmentTracking on the VR-Folding dataset, showing it can achieve real-time performance and is more accurate than baseline methods. The method also generalizes well to real-world data.

5. The VR-Garment system, VR-Folding dataset, and GarmentTracking framework provide a platform to facilitate future research on garment pose estimation and tracking.

In summary, the key contribution is a complete pipeline for garment pose tracking, including data collection, dataset creation, and a strong baseline method. The VR-based data collection and large-scale annotation are also significant contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a complete framework for category-level garment pose tracking, including a VR system for data collection, a large-scale simulation dataset, and an end-to-end online tracking approach. The key idea is to leverage temporal information and shape priors to achieve more stable and accurate garment pose estimation compared to single-frame methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:

- This paper introduces a new task called "Category-level Garment Pose Tracking", extending previous work on single-frame garment pose estimation to the video setting. 

- The paper proposes a full pipeline for this task, including a VR-based data collection system, a large-scale dataset, and an end-to-end tracking framework. This provides a strong baseline for future research on garment tracking.

- The tracking framework leverages inter-frame information like canonical coordinates from previous frames. This is different from prior single-frame methods like GarmentNets, allowing more stable predictions over long videos.

- The paper focuses on garment manipulation scenes with complex deformations, unlike prior work on clothed humans which relies more on body priors. The dataset contains diverse garment configurations from actions like flattening and folding.

- For evaluation, the paper compares to GarmentNets adapted for per-frame prediction. Experiments show the tracking method is significantly more accurate, especially for unseen garments. This demonstrates its ability to generalize.

- The tracking framework operates online, avoiding slow optimizations like volumetric fusion. This allows real-time performance not seen in other non-rigid tracking techniques.

In summary, this paper advances garment pose estimation to the dynamic setting, with contributions in data, methods, and experiments. It provides strong baselines for future research on category-level non-rigid tracking. The VR-based data collection could also inspire datasets in other domains.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Applying the GarmentTracking method to real-world robotic manipulation tasks like folding: The authors mention that their VR-Folding dataset could be useful for robot imitation learning. They also demonstrate qualitative results on real-world data, showing the potential to apply their method to real robotic folding scenarios.

- Using the VR-Garment system to collect data for tracking other deformable objects: The paper mentions that VR-Garment could facilitate dataset collection for other deformable objects beyond just garments. Tracking other thin, deformable objects like cloth, paper, plastic, etc. could be interesting future work.

- Improving tracking accuracy and speed: While GarmentTracking outperforms prior methods, there is still room for improvement in tracking accuracy and speed. Exploring different network architectures or loss functions to improve performance would be worthwhile.

- Long-term tracking over even longer sequences: The paper shows results on flattening and folding videos, but tracking over extremely long videos (e.g. hours) could reveal new challenges. Testing the limits of long-term stability and accuracy could be interesting.

- Self-supervised or unsupervised tracking: The method relies on supervised learning with ground truth pose labels. Investigating how to train such models with less supervision via self-supervision or no pose labels at all could increase applicability.

- Tracking garments on human bodies: The current method only considers manipulated/isolated garments. Extending it to track garments worn on moving humans would be important for applications like virtual try-on or motion capture.

So in summary, applying the method to real robots, collecting more diverse data, improving accuracy/speed, longer tracking, reducing supervision, and handling humans seem like promising research directions suggested by the authors. The VR-Garment system and GarmentTracking method provide a good foundation to build on for deformable garment tracking research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a complete framework for garment pose tracking, including a VR-based data collection system (VR-Garment), a large-scale dataset (VR-Folding), and an end-to-end tracking method (GarmentTracking). The VR-Garment system allows efficient collection of simulated garment manipulation data with complex poses. The VR-Folding dataset contains about 100k videos of garment flattening and folding tasks. GarmentTracking takes point cloud sequences as input and predicts complete garment geometry with semantic correspondence. It performs tracking in three stages: canonical coordinate prediction, coordinate refinement, and mapping to task space. Experiments show the method achieves higher accuracy and speed compared to single-frame pose estimation baselines. The framework serves as a strong solution for the challenging garment pose tracking task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method for category-level garment pose tracking in manipulation tasks like flattening and folding. The authors first develop a VR-based system called VR-Garment to collect a large-scale garment manipulation dataset called VR-Folding. In VR-Garment, volunteers can manipulate virtual garment models in a simulator through a VR interface. The VR-Folding dataset contains 9767 videos of complex garment poses during manipulation, with full annotations like multi-view RGB-D, masks, and garment meshes. 

Based on the VR-Folding dataset, the authors propose an end-to-end framework called GarmentTracking for online garment pose tracking. It takes point cloud sequences as input and outputs the complete garment geometry with semantic correspondence. GarmentTracking has three main stages: a NOCS predictor to predict per-point canonical coordinates, a NOCS refiner to refine the predictions, and a warp field mapper to map from canonical to task space. Experiments show GarmentTracking achieves higher accuracy and is 5 times faster than the baseline method. The method also generalizes to real-world data, demonstrating its efficacy for category-level garment pose tracking.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an end-to-end online tracking method called GarmentTracking for category-level garment pose tracking. The main method can be summarized as follows:

The method takes two input point clouds from consecutive frames along with the garment's canonical mesh and first frame pose. It first extracts features for each point cloud using a 3D convolutional network. It then matches features between frames using self-attention and cross-attention modules based on Transformers. This results in an inter-frame fusion feature that captures temporal correspondences. 

Using this fusion feature, it predicts per-point canonical coordinates (NOCS) for the current frame. To refine the NOCS predictions and canonical mesh, it employs a NOCS refiner module that fuses point cloud features and mesh features in a mutually benefiting way. 

Finally, it scatters the refined per-point features into a 3D volume based on the predicted NOCS. This volume is processed by a 3D UNet to predict a warp field that maps points from canonical space to task space, resulting in the complete pose estimation for the current frame.

The method performs tracking in an online manner, leveraging temporal information across frames through the inter-frame fusion feature and NOCS predictions. The NOCS refiner helps reduce error accumulation over time.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of category-level garment pose tracking in videos. Specifically:

- It proposes a new task called "Category-level Garment Pose Tracking", which aims to track the complete pose (including occluded parts) of a deformable garment in a video, while being able to generalize to novel unseen garment instances of the same category. 

- It notes that existing methods for non-rigid tracking, 4D reconstruction, and garment reconstruction have limitations that make them unsuitable for this new task.

- To enable research on this task, the paper collects a new dataset called VR-Folding using a VR-based recording system. The dataset contains complex garment manipulations like flattening and folding.

- The paper proposes an end-to-end framework called GarmentTracking for category-level garment pose tracking. It leverages a canonical space representation and performs tracking in three stages - canonical coordinate prediction, refinement, and mapping to task space.

- Experiments show the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy and speed. The method also generalizes to unseen garments and real-world data.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) proposing a new garment pose tracking task, (2) collecting a dataset for it, and (3) developing a strong baseline approach to address this challenging problem. The paper aims to promote further research on category-level tracking of highly deformable objects like garments.
