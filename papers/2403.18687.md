# [InceptionTime vs. Wavelet -- A comparison for time series classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Classifying infrasound signals from different sources (e.g. earthquakes, explosions, ocean waves) is important for monitoring applications. Automated classification with machine learning can be useful.

Approach:
- Compares two approaches to classify simulated infrasound time series data: 
  1) Direct classification of time series using InceptionTime neural network
  2) Transform signals into 2D spectral images via wavelet transform, then classify images with ResNet model
- Uses Python libraries fastai and tsai for high-level model development and GPU acceleration  

Data:  
- 2400 simulated 94-datapoint time series signals labeled into 8 event categories 
- 20% held out as validation set to evaluate model accuracy

Direct Model:
- Custom output layer added to pre-trained InceptionTime for time series classification 
- Achieves 95.2% accuracy after tuning hyperparameters over multiple training runs

Wavelet Model:  
- Best results with full frequency band morlet wavelet and viridis colormap 
- ResNet50 reaches 90.2% accuracy on wavelet images

Conclusion:
- Direct time series approach performs better - higher accuracy and much faster training
- Shows promise for generalizing time series classification to other signals (e.g. oscilloscope, machine vibration)
- High-level ML libraries make AI more accessible for non-experts across domains

Main Contributions:
- Compares direct vs. wavelet transform approaches for classifying infrasound data
- Achieves 95.2% accuracy on simulated datasets using InceptionTime
- Highlights ease of use of high-level ML libraries for time series classification
