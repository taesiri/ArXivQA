# [AttenScribble: Attentive Similarity Learning for Scribble-Supervised   Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06614)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation that integrates spatial self-attention (SSA), masked conditional random fields (MCRF), and attentive similarity learning (ASL). The key idea is to attach a pluggable SSA module to internal convolutional feature layers of a fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone to capture global context. The learned attention matrices are then used to derive an attentive similarity metric between predictions, which is incorporated as a novel regularization loss along with a masked CRF loss. Together, these components enable end-to-end learning directly from scribble annotations without needing pseudo-labels. Experiments on MRI cardiac and abdominal datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with significant reductions in false positives and more precise adherence to target boundaries compared to prior methods. The framework is straightforward yet effective, approaching the accuracy of full supervision for medical image segmentation from sparse scribble labels alone. The attentive similarity loss is shown to play a vital role in refining object boundaries.
