# [Augmenting Math Word Problems via Iterative Question Composing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Solving math word problems that require complex reasoning remains challenging for open-source large language models (LLMs) compared to advanced proprietary models like GPT-4. For example, LLMs still struggle on the MATH benchmark dataset.
- Simply adding more data does not always improve performance, so better methods are needed to improve mathematical reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new augmentation method called Iterative Question Composing (IQC) that can iteratively generate diverse new question-response pairs starting from a seed dataset.  
- Construct a new dataset called MMIQC that combines processed web data and synthetic data generated via IQC and other methods.
- Fine-tune base LLMs like Mistral-7B on MMIQC to get models with stronger math reasoning abilities.

Key Results:
- Mistral-7B-MMIQC achieves 36.0% on MATH, much higher than prior best open-source LLM of same size.
- Ablation studies show contribution of different MMIQC subsets. IQC accounts for significant 3.1% gain.
- Analysis shows low risk of test set contamination/memorization. Improvements are from diverse data and IQC effectiveness.

Main Contributions:
- Propose IQC method to iteratively augment math word problems.
- Release MMIQC dataset combining web data and synthetic question-response pairs.  
- Achieve new SOTA for open-source 7B LLM on MATH benchmark.
- Show fine-tuning on mixture of web data and synthetic data can effectively improve LLMs.
- Demonstrate using multiple augmentation techniques like IQC generates helpful training data.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed IQC solution and MMIQC dataset, main results showing improvements over prior art, and highlights the major contributions made in the paper.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing IQC (Iterative Question Composing), a novel data augmentation method for math word problem datasets that can iteratively generate diverse data starting from a seed dataset. 

2. Releasing MMIQC, a mixture of processed web data and synthetic question-response pairs generated using multiple augmentation methods including IQC. Models fine-tuned on MMIQC achieve new state-of-the-art results on the MATH benchmark.

3. Showing that reusing high-quality data from pre-training corpora during fine-tuning improves model performance, combining continued pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.  

4. Demonstrating that using multiple augmentation methods to construct datasets for fine-tuning is an efficient way to improve the performance of large language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Iterative Question Composing (IQC) elegantly combine the benefits of continued pre-training and supervised fine-tuning? What insights allowed the authors to develop this hybrid approach?

2. The success of IQC depends on the quality of the two models used, the question composer and the rejection sampler. What model capacities and tuning strategies are best to balance cost and performance?  

3. How was the prompting strategy designed in IQC to maximize diversity of generated questions while preserving correctness? Were other prompting approaches tested and how did they compare?

4. What were the key factors that resulted in later IQC iterations continuing to generate useful new data compared to other iterative data augmentation techniques? 

5. Does the performance improvement from IQC hold across different base model architectures and sizes or is it more pronounced for certain model types?

6. How do the links and dependencies between the generated questions change over successive IQC iterations? Does this allow assessing the complexity of reasoning captured?  

7. Can principles from IQC be used to make the MetaMathQA dataset itself more efficient, requiring fewer samples? How does curation compare to generation?

8. How does the human understanding of mathematical concepts mesh with what models learn through IQC-generated datasets? Are there concepts that are still challenging to communicate?

9. Beyond improving model accuracy, does fine-tuning on IQC-generated data provide other benefits such as faster learning, better calibration, or improved robustness?

10. How far can iterative question generation be pushed - what factors cause later iterations to start generating unusable or redundant samples? Can the prompts be automatically adjusted?
