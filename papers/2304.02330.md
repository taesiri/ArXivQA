# [SMPConv: Self-moving Point Representations for Continuous Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02330)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes an alternative approach to building continuous convolution kernels using self-moving point representations and interpolation, instead of using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) like most prior work. - The goal is to create a more computationally efficient and higher performing continuous convolution, while avoiding the drawbacks of MLP-based approaches such as high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited descriptive power of the filters.- The self-moving point representation allows weight parameters to freely move, and interpolation is used to implement continuous functions for the kernels. This results in lightweight and flexible representations.- Experiments across different tasks (1D sequence, 2D image, large-scale ImageNet) demonstrate improved performance and efficiency over MLP-based continuous convolutions and other baselines.- The method provides benefits such as handling irregularly sampled data, modeling long-term dependencies, constructing large kernels efficiently, and improved performance as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution.In summary, the key hypothesis is that self-moving point representations with interpolation can build better performing and more efficient continuous convolutional kernels compared to prevailing MLP-based approaches. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis across different tasks and datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a new method called SMPConv to implement continuous convolution without using neural networks like MLPs. Instead, it uses self-moving point representations and interpolation schemes. - This approach has several benefits compared to prior MLP-based continuous convolution methods:1) It is more computationally efficient as it does not require additional neural networks to generate kernels. 2) It has fewer hyperparameters to tune since it does not use MLPs.3) The learned kernels are not restricted by the inductive biases of MLP architectures.- The method is evaluated on various tasks including 1D sequential data, 2D image data, and large-scale ImageNet classification. It consistently outperforms prior arts across these datasets when used as a drop-in replacement.- To the best of their knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of continuous convolution on large-scale ImageNet classification.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a lightweight and effective alternative to MLP-based continuous convolution that achieves improved performance across diverse tasks including large-scale image classification. The self-moving point representation with interpolation is the core novelty enabling these benefits.
