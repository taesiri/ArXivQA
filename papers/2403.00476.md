# [TempCompass: Do Video LLMs Really Understand Videos?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00476)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent video large language models (Video LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of these models' temporal perception abilities, which is crucial for genuine video understanding. Specifically, most benchmarks fail to differentiate between nuanced temporal aspects and mainly rely on a single task format like multiple choice QA. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes TempCompass, a new benchmark to evaluate the temporal perception skills of Video LLMs. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce 5 types of temporal aspects: action, speed, direction, attribute change, event order. Each has 2-4 sub-aspects, allowing nuanced evaluation. 

2) Design 4 distinct task formats: multi-choice QA, yes/no QA, caption matching, caption generation. This tests how performance varies across tasks.  

3) Construct "conflicting videos" that share static content but differ in temporal aspects. This prevents exploiting static cues or language priors.

4) Annotate meta information about videos for humans+LLMs to collaboratively generate high-quality instructions. 

5) An automatic evaluation method using ChatGPT's language understanding to judge free-form LLM responses.

Main Contributions:

1) A new benchmark, TempCompass, for comprehensive evaluation of temporal perception skills of Video LLMs. It has rich temporal aspects, diverse tasks and open-domain videos.

2) Novel techniques like conflicting videos and human+LLM collaboration for high-quality data collection.

3) Extensive experiments on 11 SOTA models revealing poor temporal perception abilities, emphasizing the need for enhancement.

4) The benchmark and evaluation toolkit to facilitate future research on improving Video LLMs.

In summary, this paper makes valuable contributions towards benchmarking and enhancing the temporal perception capabilities of Video LLMs through the proposed TempCompass.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark called TempCompass to comprehensively evaluate the temporal perception ability of video large language models across diverse aspects and task formats, revealing their deficiency in genuine understanding of dynamic visual information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It presents a benchmark called TempCompass to comprehensively evaluate the temporal perception ability of Video LLMs. TempCompass introduces diverse temporal aspects (10 fine-grained aspects) and task formats (4 types) to provide a more complete assessment.

2. It proposes two key strategies for high-quality data collection: (a) Constructing conflicting videos to mitigate the influence of single-frame bias and language priors; (b) Annotating meta-information and leveraging LLMs to efficiently generate task instructions. 

3. It reveals empirically that state-of-the-art Video LLMs still exhibit notably weak capability in temporal perception, failing to surpass Image LLMs on the TempCompass benchmark. The results emphasize the need for enhancing Video LLMs' capacity of modeling temporal dynamics in videos.

The paper proposes a new benchmark called TempCompass to evaluate the temporal perception ability of Video LLMs across different temporal aspects and task formats. It uses conflicting videos and an automatic evaluation method to assess model performance. The results reveal issues with properly understanding temporal dynamics in existing Video LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces conflicting video pairs/triplets to mitigate the influence of single-frame bias and language priors. What are the three specific strategies used to construct these conflicting videos and how do they help alleviate shortcuts?

2. The paper uses both rule-based methods and an LLM (ChatGPT) for automatic evaluation. What are the relative merits and limitations of both approaches? When is each one used?

3. The caption generation task requires selecting the correct information piece from candidates and generating a suitable caption. How does the automatic evaluation method accurately assess the correctness in this complex task?

4. What are the key differences between the temporal aspects evaluated in existing video QA benchmarks versus TempCompass? How does TempCompass enable a more comprehensive assessment?

5. The paper finds that performance of models varies significantly across different task types like MCQA, Yes/No QA and caption matching. What inferences can be made about the video understanding abilities of models based on these observed variations?

6. How exactly does the paper collect the task instructions, utilizing both human annotation and LLM generation? What is the motivation behind this hybrid approach?

7. The paper reveals poor temporal perception abilities in SOTA video LLMs. What architectural limitations could be responsible for this deficiency? How can models be improved?

8. The video contents are classified into static categories like people, vehicles etc. Why is a uniform coverage over these categories important for benchmark diversity?

9. The paper uses meta-information to derive instructions automatically. What are the constituents of this meta-information and how does it aid the downstream instruction generation process?

10. Conflicting videos help mitigate shortcuts, but performance above random baselines implies some persisting biases. What additional strategies could further eliminate such spurious cues?
