# [Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing pose-guided person image synthesis methods based on GANs or diffusion models suffer from overfitting when generating images of people in unseen poses. They lack high-level semantic understanding of person images and simply align the appearance details from the source image to the target pose. This leads to distorted results for uncommon target poses. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion (CFLD) method to address this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Decouple fine-grained appearance and pose control at different stages using a perception-refined decoder (PRD) to extract a semantic understanding of person images as a coarse-grained prompt.

2) Design a hybrid-granularity attention (HGA) module to bias the prompt with fine-grained appearance features from the source image to better preserve texture details.

3) The PRD refines a set of learnable queries via cross-attention to focus on common human body part semantics across images. 

4) The HGA injects multi-scale appearance features from the source image as bias terms to augment the prompt in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Main Contributions:

1) A new training paradigm without image captions to apply latent diffusion models to pose-guided synthesis.

2) A perception-refined decoder to extract semantic understanding of person images as coarse-grained prompts.

3) A hybrid-granularity attention module for fine-grained appearance biasing to enhance texture details.

4) State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results on DeepFashion benchmark, validated via extensive experiments and user studies.
