## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Survival Beran-based Neural Importance Model (SurvBeNIM) for explaining predictions of machine learning survival models. SurvBeNIM extends previous methods SurvNAM and SurvBeX by incorporating flexible neural network-based importance functions into the kernels of the Beran estimator. Compared to SurvLIME and SurvNAM which use the Cox model, SurvBeNIM is based on the more sensitive Beran estimator that accounts for data structure. Unlike SurvBeX which also uses the Beran estimator but with fixed kernels, SurvBeNIM implements the importance functions with neural networks, allowing them to capture complex relationships. The importance functions directly show how features impact predictions, compared to SurvNAM's shape functions which require interpretation. SurvBeNIM is evaluated on synthetic and real-world survival data, demonstrating superior performance over SurvLIME, SurvNAM, and SurvBeX in terms of approximation error and correct feature selection, especially on complex non-linear data. The main disadvantage is the greater computational difficulty of training the neural network. Future work includes studying different kernel types, adding more kernel parameters, and combining SurvBeNIM with SurvNAM.
