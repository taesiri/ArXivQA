# [InterEvo-TR: Interactive Evolutionary Test Generation With Readability   Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Automated test case generation tools like EvoSuite can effectively generate tests to achieve high code coverage. However, studies show that testers are often reluctant to adopt these automatically-generated tests due to their lack of readability compared to manually-written tests. There is a need to improve the readability of automatically-generated tests to increase acceptance by testers.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an interactive approach called InterEvo-TR that allows testers to incorporate their subjective evaluation of test case readability into the EvoSuite test generation process. At certain points during the evolutionary search, the tool pauses and shows the tester multiple test cases covering the same target and asks them to assess the readability of each test by assigning a score. The tool implements various mechanisms to handle the interaction schedule, selection of targets and tests to show, integration of readability scores, etc. The goal is to evolve towards a final test suite that aligns more with the tester's perception of readable tests.

Main Contributions:

- An interactive approach specifically designed to integrate readability assessments from testers into search-based test case generation

- Implementation of the approach by extending EvoSuite, available as open-source. Includes new options to customize when and how interactions happen.

- An empirical study with 39 participants interacting with the tool to assess feasibility. Analysis of participants' actions and survey responses to gain insights on test code readability and benefits/limitations of interactivity.

- Results show the approach helps achieve more readable tests suites catered to testers' preferences. Interactions also help participants better understand purpose of some tests.

Overall, the interactive approach facilitates incorporating subjective readability preferences into automated test generation, helping improve adoption and acceptance of tools like EvoSuite.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an interactive approach, InterEvo-TR, that allows testers to incorporate their subjective readability assessment into the evolutionary test generation process of EvoSuite in order to guide the search towards more readable test suites according to the tester's preferences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of an interactive approach, called InterEvo-TR, that allows testers to incorporate their subjective evaluation of the readability of automatically generated test cases into the evolutionary test generation process. Specifically, the paper makes the following key contributions:

1) It designs and implements an interactive approach on top of EvoSuite that interacts with testers at different moments during the search. The approach involves selecting coverage targets, preparing candidate test cases for inspection, collecting readability scores from testers, and integrating this feedback to guide the search towards more readable test suites. 

2) It provides an implementation of this interactive approach by extending EvoSuite's default algorithm DynaMOSA. The new tool, called InterEvo-TR, includes novel options to handle the interactivity and readability assessment.

3) It validates the approach through an empirical study with 39 participants. By analyzing their actions and responses to a survey, the paper offers insights into the subjective perception of test code readability, the influence of design decisions in the interaction process, and the usefulness of incorporating interactivity into test case generation.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and validation of a novel interactive approach that successfully incorporates subjective readability assessments from testers into search-based test generation, helping tools like EvoSuite reach more acceptable test suites.

The paper proposes an interactive approach called InterEvo-TR that allows testers to incorporate their subjective evaluation of test case readability into the EvoSuite test generation tool during the search process. It adapts EvoSuite's default evolutionary algorithm, DynaMOSA, to support this interactivity and readability assessment. The key aspects explored in the paper relate to designing the interaction schedule, selecting targets and test cases, handling the readability scores provided, and evaluating the approach through an empirical study with participants. The main goal is to generate a more readable test suite reflecting the tester's preferences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an interactive approach called InterEvo-TR that allows testers to incorporate their subjective evaluation of test case readability into the EvoSuite test generation tool. Can you explain in detail how this interactivity is integrated with EvoSuite's default evolutionary algorithm DynaMOSA? 

2. The paper discusses the design decisions involved in incorporating interactivity into EvoSuite, such as interaction schedule, target selection strategy, readability score handling, etc. Can you analyze the rationale behind some of these design choices and discuss if alternative options could also be reasonable?

3. The interactive approach pauses the search process at certain points and shows test cases covering the same target to the tester for readability assessment. What is the strategy used to select interesting coverage targets and diverse test cases to present to the tester? Critically analyze this selection methodology.

4. Two new archives - preference archive and readability archive are introduced in the interactive version of EvoSuite. Can you explain the purpose of each archive and how they are used to integrate the tester's feedback? 

5. The study involves participants interacting with the tool and providing readability scores for candidate test cases. How is this highly subjective readability assessment process analyzed in the paper? What conclusions can you draw about test code readability from the results?

6. The paper discusses participants' perspective on several aspects like number of interactions, information provided, influence of different factors on readability score, etc. Analyze and compare the qualitative survey responses and actual interaction data from log files.  

7. The paper evaluates three main aspects regarding the interactive approach - test readability, interaction process and usefulness. Can you summarize the key findings for each aspect and their implications?

8. One of the research questions analyzes the relation between covered targets and length of associated test cases. How are the results of this analysis used to determine the target selection strategy? Critically discuss this.

9. The study uses only one class for the interactive experiment with participants. What are the limitations of this scope? How can the experimental setup be improved in future studies?

10. The paper mentions combining the interactive approach with automated test improvement techniques as future work. Can you suggest ways in which both methods could complement each other? What kind of empirical study could be designed to evaluate this?
