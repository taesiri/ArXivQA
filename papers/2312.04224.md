# [Parameter fine-tuning method for MMG model using real-scale ship data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04224)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose a method to fine-tune the parameters of the MMG ship maneuvering model using real-scale trial data. The MMG model contains several parameters related to hydrodynamic forces that are typically determined from model tests or CFD simulations. However, differences between model-scale and full-scale conditions can lead to inaccuracies. To address this, the authors formulate a parameter tuning problem using time series data from full-scale trials to minimize the deviation between simulated and measured trajectories. They select 12 key parameters related to hull, propeller, and rudder forces as optimization variables. The search ranges are constrained to neighborhoods around nominal values to output realistic parameters. The problem is solved using CMA-ES to find globally optimal solutions. The method tunes all parameters simultaneously and is applied to a 83m container ship with various exploration ranges. In all cases, the maneuvering simulations have improved accuracy compared to using default parameters, thus validating the proposed automatic fine-tuning approach. The optimized model can enable more reliable testing of autonomous ship control systems. Limiting search ranges and using separate test data sets helps avoid issues like overfitting. Overall, this research presents a practical methodology to identify suitable full-scale ship dynamics parameters.
