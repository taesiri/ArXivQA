# [Causal Discovery under Off-Target Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08229)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of causal graph discovery when the interventions attempted can be "off-target", meaning that the actual intervention done is stochastic and may affect variables beyond the intended target. This models scenarios like CRISPR gene knockouts where off-target effects are common. The paper introduces a flexible stochastic intervention model that subsumes previous noiseless intervention models.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. The paper shows a reduction between the off-target verification problem (checking if a proposed causal graph is correct) and the stochastic set cover problem. This allows leveraging existing techniques for stochastic set cover to design algorithms with guarantees for off-target verification.

2. For off-target search (finding the correct causal graph), the paper proves no algorithm can achieve non-trivial approximation ratios compared to the optimal off-target search cost. This motivates using a benchmark based on the best possible algorithm.

3. The paper gives an efficient off-target search algorithm that achieves a polylogarithmic approximation ratio compared to the benchmark cost of the best algorithm that knows the equivalence class but not the true causal graph. This uses graph separators and competing against some causal DAG in the equivalence class.

4. The paper defines a very general stochastic intervention model that can capture different types of off-target interventions. This lays the theoretical foundations for studying causal discovery under flexible off-target interventions.

In summary, the key ideas are reducing verification to stochastic set cover, proving hardness of search, and giving an efficient search algorithm with approximation guarantees under this new general off-target intervention model. The paper introduces the model and provides initial positive and negative results to establish theoretical foundations for this direction.
