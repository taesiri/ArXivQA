# [Relevant Intrinsic Feature Enhancement Network for Few-Shot Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06474)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing few-shot semantic segmentation methods suffer from two main issues that limit their accuracy: 

1) Semantic ambiguity: Different instances of the same foreground class have large intra-class variability, leading models to extract ambiguous features like shape and pose rather than robust class representations. This causes inconsistent and inaccurate segmentation.

2) Inter-class similarity: Use of global prototypes or single-granularity local prototypes provides inadequate and monotonous information. This leads to confusion and misidentification between foreground and background, especially when they have similar textures.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Relevant Intrinsic Feature Enhancement Network (RiFeNet) to address these issues. The main ideas are:

1) Add an unlabeled branch that shares parameters with the query branch. It teaches the model to extract intrinsic features robust to intra-class differences, enhancing foreground semantic consistency.

2) Propose a multi-level prototype generation and interaction module. It extracts a global prototype representing high-level semantics of the class, and local prototypes providing fine-grained discriminative details. Their interaction complements each other for better foreground-background distinction.

Main Contributions:

1) Unlabeled branch to constrain semantic consistency without needing extra data at test time. Improves intra-class generalization of foreground.

2) Multi-granularity global and local prototypes that interact to provide class-specific information at both high-level and detailed levels. Significantly improves inter-class variability between confusing foreground and background.  

3) State-of-the-art performance on PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets. Outperforms previous best methods by 2.5-3.5% on PASCAL and 0.8% on COCO.

4) Ablation studies validate the unlabeled branch and multi-prototype designs are critical for the improvements.

In summary, RiFeNet enhances relevant intrinsic features to address key semantic segmentation challenges in few-shot setting, through an unlabeled branch and multi-level prototype interaction. This achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy.
