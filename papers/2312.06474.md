# [Relevant Intrinsic Feature Enhancement Network for Few-Shot Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06474)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel few-shot semantic segmentation model called Relevant Intrinsic Feature Enhancement Network (RiFeNet) to address two key issues limiting existing methods: semantic ambiguity of the foreground objects and inter-class similarity between foreground and background. RiFeNet introduces an additional unlabeled branch that utilizes unlabeled images to teach the model to extract intrinsic features robust to intra-class appearance differences. This helps maintain semantic consistency of the foreground. The paper also proposes a multi-level prototype generation and interaction module to capture both high-level semantic abstractions and fine-grained discriminative details. The global prototype represents the overall category structure while the local prototypes provide complementary spatial details to distinguish between similar classes. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The unlabeled branch and multi-prototype interaction each bring around 2% mIoU improvement. RiFeNet outperforms existing methods by 2-3% in the 1-shot setting by enhancing relevance of intrinsic features to address foreground ambiguity and widening inter-class differences to facilitate foreground-background classification.
