# [The Calibration Gap between Model and Human Confidence in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13835)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are being increasingly relied upon for decision-making, but it's unclear how much users can accurately judge the reliability of LLM outputs. 
- Specifically, there may be a "calibration gap" between the LLM's internal confidence in its predictions, and what level of confidence humans externally perceive based on the LLM's explanations.
- It's important to study whether explanations can be adapted to better communicate internal LLM confidence to improve human judgment of reliability.

Methodology:
- Behavioral experiments conducted where participants assess GPT-3.5's or PaLM2's confidence on multiple choice questions, based solely on textual explanations.
- Model confidence is compared to human confidence ratings to assess calibration gap. 
- Explanations are manipulated to express varying uncertainty levels reflecting internal model confidence.

Key Findings:  
- Significant gap found between model confidence and human confidence based on default LLM explanations, indicating overestimation of LLM accuracy.
- Modifying explanations to align with model confidence improves calibration and discrimination of human confidence ratings.
- Tailoring uncertainty language in LLM output is important for accurate communication of reliability to users.

Main Contributions:
- First study investigating human perception of confidence in LLM textual explanations, using behavioral experiments.
- Demonstrates overconfidence in LLM abilities is a key concern affecting reliability judgments.  
- Providing explanations tailored to internal model confidence significantly improves calibration of user trust in LLM outputs.
- Underscores need for transparency in communicating confidence to ensure responsible LLM use, especially in high-stakes domains.

In summary, the study provides critical insight into the calibration gap issue in human-LLM interaction and shows that adapted explanations can help address this gap to improve assessment of LLM reliability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the gap between large language models' internal confidence in their answers to multiple choice questions and humans' perception of the models' confidence based on default or modified explanations, finding overestimation by humans that can be reduced through explanations tailored to model confidence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating the effectiveness of tailored explanations in reducing the gap between what a large language model (LLM) knows internally (its model confidence) and what users perceive it knows (human confidence in the LLM) based on its textual explanations. Specifically, the paper shows that by modifying the language of LLM explanations to better reflect the model's internal confidence levels, users have improved calibration in assessing the reliability of the LLM's responses. This highlights the importance of transparent communication of confidence from LLMs to facilitate appropriate trust and reliance on AI assistants.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes modifying the language used in LLM explanations to better reflect the model's internal confidence. Could this approach introduce bias or change the actual content/validity of the explanation itself? How might the researchers test for or control such effects?

2. The calibration gap represents the difference between an LLM's internal confidence and human perception of confidence based on explanations. What other factors, beyond language expressing uncertainty, might influence this gap? Could properties of the explanation itself (length, specificity, etc.) play a role?  

3. The paper finds that longer explanations did not significantly impact human confidence judgments for GPT-3.5 but did for lower-confidence PaLM2 explanations. What might account for this discrepancy? Does explanation quality/content play a bigger role when confidence is lower?

4. Might the relationship between expressed linguistic uncertainty and human confidence judgments depend on the domain of the question itself? Are there certain topics where such mappings might break down? How could this be tested?

5. The simplicity of the threshold-based method for selecting explanation types limits the range and specificity of uncertainty language. Could more advanced natural language generation methods better capture subtle confidence gradations? What challenges might this introduce?

6. The paper focuses solely on multiple choice questions. How might the findings apply to other open-ended QA scenarios? Would similar verbal manipulation strategies work or fail there? What new challenges might arise?

7. Participants answered questions with LLM assistance but largely relied on LLM explanations. Could participants have utilized their own knowledge more effectively, had explanations enabled better understanding? Should enabling user learning be an objective?

8. Self-assessed expertise did not impact calibration gap. Does this suggest shortcomings of self-assessment or limitations of linguistic uncertainty mapping alone? Would improved assessments or different individual difference measures reveal aptitude differences? 

9. The simplicity of manipulating linguistic uncertainty likely aided interpretability and user understanding. However, are there any risks or downsides associated with deliberately reducing linguistic variability/creativity in LLM responses? 

10. The findings support using verbal uncertainty for multiple choice QA. However, for more open-ended applications, could excessive hedging undermine perceived competence without improving calibration? How might the goals of calibration and competence perception be balanced?
