# [Elaborative Simplification as Implicit Questions Under Discussion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10387)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we model and generate elaborative simplifications in text by framing them as implicit questions under discussion (QUDs)?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Viewing elaborative simplifications as answers to implicit QUDs can provide a useful framework for understanding what is elaborated, how elaborations connect to the discourse context, and generating higher quality elaborations.

In particular, the paper introduces a new dataset of implicit QUD annotations for existing elaborations, and shows that:

- The QUD framework provides insight into what concepts are elaborated on and how.

- Explicitly modeling QUDs (via question generation) substantially improves the quality of generated elaborations in a zero-shot manner compared to no prompt or generic prompts.

- However, QUD generation models that do not see the elaboration tend to ask plausible but not always perfectly on-target questions.

So in summary, the central research direction is using QUDs to better understand, analyze and generate elaborative simplifications, with both data and models supporting the utility of this framework. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new perspective on elaborative text simplification through the lens of the Question Under Discussion (QUD) framework. Specifically, the paper:

- Presents ElabQUD, a new dataset of 1,299 elaborations from existing simplified news articles, annotated with implicit QUDs that the elaborations answer as well as the targets being elaborated. 

- Analyzes the dataset to understand what concepts authors choose to elaborate on and what types of implicit questions arise before elaborations.

- Trains and evaluates neural question generation models to recover implicit QUDs. 

- Shows that feeding generated QUDs as prompts to large language models leads to better quality elaborations compared to no prompt or a generic prompt.

The key insight is to model elaborations as answers to implicit questions that arise when difficult concepts are encountered. This provides a natural way to analyze and generate elaborations. The introduction of the ElabQUD dataset and findings from analysis and experiments demonstrate the utility of this perspective. Overall, the work lays a foundation to connect elaborative simplification with discourse modeling through the QUD framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes viewing elaborative simplification through the lens of implicit Questions Under Discussion (QUD), introduces a new dataset of QUD annotations for simplification elaborations, and shows that modeling QUDs can substantially improve the quality of generated elaborations compared to no QUD modeling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions to research on text simplification and elaborative simplification:

- It proposes viewing elaborative simplification through the framework of Questions Under Discussion (QUD). This provides a new way to analyze what concepts authors choose to elaborate on, how they elaborate, and how elaborations fit into the surrounding discourse context. 

- It introduces a new dataset, ElabQUD, consisting of 1300 elaborations from the Newsela dataset along with annotated implicit QUDs that the elaborations answer. This provides a valuable new resource for studying elaborative simplification.

- It explores different question generation models for recovering implicit QUDs, considering both models that see the elaboration and more realistic models that do not. This provides insights into the challenges of accurately modeling editors' thought processes.

- It shows that explicitly prompting strong language models like GPT-3 with generated QUDs substantially improves the quality of generated elaborations compared to no prompt or a generic prompt. This demonstrates the utility of the QUD framework.

Compared to prior work:

- It goes beyond just retrieving definitions for elaboration, analyzing a more diverse set of elaboration types.

- It studies the discourse role of elaborations rather than just generating them without context. 

- It provides more explicit modeling and analysis of elaboration compared to end-to-end neural models that have struggled with hallucination.

Overall, this paper makes an important connection between elaborative simplification and discourse structure. The analysis and datasets provide a strong foundation for future work on better understanding and generating elaborations. The QUD framework gives a principled way to study key questions around elaborative simplification.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:

- Exploring when elaborations should be added, rather than just how they should be generated. The authors focused on generating elaborations in this work, but note that deciding when elaborations are needed is an important question for future work. This could involve developing models sensitive to reader demographics to determine when elaboration is necessary.

- Improving question generation for elaborations, especially in the expectation-driven paradigm where the elaboration is not seen. The authors found that generated "implicit QUDs" sometimes deviated from the exact questions human annotators provided. Better modeling of the target/anchor could help generate more accurate implicit QUDs.

- Applying the QUD framework interactively based on reader needs. The authors suggest QUD provides a natural way for readers to explicitly request elaborations when needed. This is related to the first point about determining when elaborations help.

- Evaluating the approach on other genres beyond news articles. The elaborative simplification dataset used here was based on news, so testing the QUD approach on other text genres is noted. 

- Exploring interactive simplification and elaboration for other languages besides English. The current work focused only on English text.

In summary, key future directions are: determining when to elaborate, improving implicit QUD modeling, interactive elaboration, evaluating across genres and languages. The QUD framework provides a useful lens but there are still many open challenges in generating high-quality, reader-specific elaborations during text simplification.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes viewing elaborative simplification through the lens of the Question Under Discussion (QUD) framework. The authors argue that elaborations can be thought of as answers to implicit questions that arise when difficult concepts are encountered during simplification. They introduce ElabQUD, a dataset of 1,299 elaborations from simplified news articles, annotated with implicit QUDs that the elaborations answer. The paper analyzes what is elaborated on, finding targets are often entities and events containing less frequent words. It also examines the types of implicit questions, showing causal reasoning and explanations predominate. Experiments are conducted on question generation, where models attempt to recover the implicit QUDs. Generated questions are found to provide useful guidance for zero-shot elaboration generation using GPT-3, compared to no prompt or generic prompts. Overall, the QUD framework provides a way to analyze and generate elaborations by modeling the questions simplifiers implicitly ask. The introduced dataset and analyses lay groundwork connecting elaborations and discourse structure.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes viewing elaborative simplification through the lens of the Question Under Discussion (QUD) framework. Elaborative simplification refers to explaining or elaborating difficult concepts when simplifying text to make it more accessible. The authors argue that elaborations can be modeled as explicit answers to implicit questions that arise when encountering difficult concepts. 

The paper introduces ElabQUD, a dataset of 1,299 elaborations from Newsela annotated with implicit QUDs. Analysis of the dataset shows that authors tend to elaborate on entities and events, especially those containing less frequent words. The implicit questions are often causal or explanatory in nature. The paper shows that explicitly modeling QUD via question generation substantially improves the quality of generated elaborations compared to no prompt or a generic prompt. However, coherence suffers slightly when directly inserting the elaborations into the document. Overall, the QUD framework provides a way to understand what is elaborated, how elaboration occurs, and how it fits into the surrounding discourse.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes to view elaborative simplification through the lens of the Question Under Discussion (QUD) framework, which provides a way to investigate what writers elaborate upon, how they elaborate, and how elaborations fit into the discourse context. The authors introduce ElabQUD, a dataset consisting of 1,299 elaborations from existing simplified news articles, along with annotated implicit QUDs that each elaboration answers. They train question generation models on QUD corpora to generate the implicit questions, comparing models that see the elaboration versus models that do not, following an expectation-driven approach. The generated questions are then provided as prompts to a large language model, GPT-3, to generate elaborations in a zero-shot manner. Results show that modeling QUD helps understand elaborative simplification and generate higher quality elaborations compared to no prompt or generic prompts, although coherence may drop when inserted directly into the document. Overall, the QUD framework provides a way to explicitly model the reasoning behind elaborations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating elaborations to simplify text. The key points are:

- Elaborative simplification involves adding explanations to make text easier to understand, but existing simplification models struggle to generate good elaborations. 

- The paper proposes viewing elaborative simplification through the lens of "questions under discussion" (QUD). The idea is that elaborations answer implicit questions in the discourse context.

- The paper introduces ElabQUD, a dataset of 1,299 elaborations annotated with the implicit questions they answer. This allows analyzing what concepts authors elaborate on and what kinds of questions are asked.

- Experiments show explicitly modeling the QUD, via question generation, substantially improves the quality of generated elaborations compared to no prompt or a generic prompt.

- Overall, the QUD framework provides a way to understand the purpose of elaborations and generate better elaborations by making the implicit question explicit. The paper lays groundwork to connect simplification with discourse structure.

In summary, the key problem is generating good elaborations during text simplification, and the paper explores using QUD modeling to address this challenge. The ElabQUD dataset and experiments demonstrate the potential of this approach.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes viewing elaborative simplification through the lens of the Question Under Discussion (QUD) framework from linguistics. The authors argue that elaborations, which explain concepts during simplification, can be modeled as answers to implicit questions that arise when difficult concepts are encountered. They introduce a new dataset called ElabQUD which contains 1,299 elaborations from simplified news articles, each annotated with an implicit "question under discussion" that the elaboration answers. Analysis of the questions shows authors often ask for definitions, examples, causes, and procedures related to concepts, and target less frequent words and verbs for elaboration. The authors train question generation models on QUD datasets, then show that feeding the questions to GPT-3 yields higher quality zero-shot elaborations compared to no question or a generic prompt. Overall, the work establishes QUD as a useful framework for modeling what is elaborated and how, providing interpretability and controllability. While not tackling when to elaborate, QUD provides an interactive way to generate elaborations based on reader feedback. Limitations include text genre restrictions and the subjective nature of complexity. Nonetheless, the annotated dataset and demonstrations provide a strong foundation for future work on controllable elaboration generation.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes viewing elaborative simplification through the lens of the Question Under Discussion (QUD) framework, where elaborations are modeled as explicit answers to implicit questions that arise when difficult concepts are encountered. The authors introduce ElabQUD, a dataset of 1,299 elaborations from simplified news articles along with annotated implicit QUDs and elaboration targets. Analysis of ElabQUD shows authors simplify by explaining concepts, providing causal reasoning, and giving examples.
