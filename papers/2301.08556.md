# [NeRF in the Palm of Your Hand: Corrective Augmentation for Robotics via   Novel-View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08556)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve imitation learning for 6-DOF object grasping from RGB images, particularly for eye-in-hand robot policies?The key ideas and contributions to address this question are:1) Proposing a new offline data augmentation technique called SPARTN that leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to generate corrective visual observations and action labels. 2) Showing that this NeRF-based augmentation can produce reactive, real-time, RGB-only policies for 6-DOF grasping.3) Demonstrating that SPARTN significantly improves imitation learning for 6-DOF grasping policies without requiring online expert supervision or environment interaction.4) Evaluating SPARTN on simulated and real-world 6-DOF grasping tasks, where it boosts success rates substantially compared to baseline imitation learning.In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to perform corrective visual augmentation using NeRFs in order to improve imitation learning for eye-in-hand grasping policies, with promising results demonstrated in both simulation and the real world. The key hypothesis is that this offline NeRF-based augmentation can produce reactive policies and reduce compounding errors for complex vision-based robot control problems like 6-DOF grasping.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a NeRF-based data augmentation technique called SPARTN (Synthetic Perturbations for Augmenting Robot Trajectories via NeRF) that improves behavior cloning for eye-in-hand visual grasping policies. Specifically:- SPARTN leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to synthetically generate perturbed camera viewpoints and corresponding corrective actions, providing a way to do corrective feedback augmentation in the visual domain. - This augmentation is done fully offline, without needing additional expert demonstrations or environment interactions.- The resulting approach produces reactive, real-time, RGB-only policies for 6-DoF grasping. - In simulation experiments, SPARTN improves grasp success rates substantially compared to no augmentation and even outperforms some methods requiring online supervision.- In real robot experiments, SPARTN improves absolute grasping success rates by an average of 22.5% over 8 challenging objects.So in summary, the main contribution is an offline data augmentation technique using NeRFs to improve imitation learning for visual robotic grasping policies. The key aspects are that it is fully offline, enables RGB-only grasping, and achieves strong empirical results in both simulation and the real world.
