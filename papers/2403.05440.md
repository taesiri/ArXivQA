# [Is Cosine-Similarity of Embeddings Really About Similarity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05440)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cosine similarity between learned embeddings is commonly used to quantify semantic similarity between entities (e.g. words, items). However, it has been observed that it sometimes works much better but also sometimes worse than using the unnormalized dot product.

- This paper studies when and why cosine similarity of embeddings can yield arbitrary and meaningless similarities through the analytical lens of matrix factorization (MF) models.

Key Insights:
- For MF models regularized through denoising (Eq 1), the solution contains an arbitrary diagonal scaling matrix D. Different choices of D lead to different and non-unique cosine similarities, even though the model predictions based on dot product are unique. 

- For MF models with separate regularization on the embeddings (Eq 2), the solution is unique up to rotations. Hence, the resulting cosine similarities are also unique in this case.

- The common practice of applying normalization only after learning can reduce semantic similarities compared to techniques that normalize during learning, like negative sampling.

Proposed Solutions:
- Train models directly with respect to cosine similarity instead of dot product.

- Avoid embedding space and compute cosine similarity directly in original input space after smoothing the data through a MF model.

- Use normalization techniques during model training itself to better capture semantics.

Contributions:
- Provides analytical and empirical evidence that cosine similarity of embeddings can be arbitrary, not unique and meaningless depending on the training process.

- Explains the underlying reasons regarding the choice of regularization and when normalization is applied.

- Cautions against blindly using cosine similarity and proposes mitigation strategies.

- Calls for rethinking the use of cosine similarity, which is prevalent in many domains especially with learned embeddings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analytically shows that cosine similarity of embeddings learned by matrix factorization models can yield arbitrary and meaningless results due to an extra degree of freedom, and proposes alternatives like training the model directly with respect to cosine similarity or avoiding the embedding space.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing analytically that cosine similarity of learned embeddings can yield arbitrary and meaningless results in some cases. Specifically:

- For matrix factorization models regularized by the nuclear norm (Eq 1), the paper shows that the embeddings have an extra degree of freedom allowing arbitrary rescaling along different dimensions. This makes the cosine similarity between embeddings non-unique and dependent on arbitrary choices.

- For an alternative regularization (Eq 2), the embeddings are unique, but it remains unclear if the resulting cosine similarities reflect true semantic similarities. 

- Experiments on simulated data illustrate how vastly different the cosine similarities can be depending on the choice of model and regularization.

The paper cautions against blindly using cosine similarity of embeddings and suggests some alternatives, like training the model directly on cosine similarity or avoiding the embedding space. Overall, it demonstrates analytically and empirically that cosine similarity of embeddings can be opaque and arbitrary, requiring more care than typically assumed.

The main focus of the paper is on studying cosine similarity of embeddings derived from regularized linear models. It analytically derives how cosine similarity can yield arbitrary and meaningless "similarities" in some cases. It also shows similarities may not be unique for some models, while controlled implicitly by the regularization in others. It discusses implications for deep models as well, where combination of regularizations have unintended effects on cosine similarities of embeddings. Based on these insights, the paper cautions against blindly using cosine similarity and suggests some alternatives.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper shows that cosine similarity of embeddings can yield arbitrary and meaningless results in some cases. Can you explain intuitively why this happens, especially for the objective in Equation 1? 

2. The paper introduces an arbitrary diagonal scaling matrix D that affects the normalization and hence cosine similarities of the embeddings. How exactly does this matrix D affect the item-item, user-user, and user-item cosine similarities?

3. For the objective in Equation 1, the paper shows two extreme cases with full rank models where the cosine similarities become either identity matrices or based entirely on the raw data matrix X. Can you explain intuitively why this happens?

4. How exactly does the choice of regularization affect whether the cosine similarities are unique or arbitrary? What is the key difference between the regularization in Equation 1 and Equation 2?

5. The paper suggests some alternatives to cosine similarity like training the model directly with respect to cosine similarity or avoiding the embedding space. Can you explain these and other potential remedies in more detail? What are their limitations and strengths?

6. While focused on matrix factorization, the paper claims similar issues likely exist in deep learning models. Can you explain why this might be the case and the potential effects on cosine similarity of embeddings there? 

7. The experiments use simulated data with known item clusters. Do you think experiments on real-world data could also provide insights into when cosine similarity works or fails? How might you design such experiments?

8. The paper cautions against blindly using cosine similarity. When might it still be reasonable to use it despite the identified issues? What criteria would help determine if it is appropriate?

9. How could the issues explored in this paper relating to cosine similarity also affect other similarity and distance metrics between embeddings? Are any less prone to such problems?

10. The paper proposes projecting embeddings back into the original space before taking cosine similarities. What might be some challenges in doing this effectively? Could this remedy also suffer from some of the identified issues?
