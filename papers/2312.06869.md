# [Adversarial Estimation of Topological Dimension with Harmonic Score Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for estimating the intrinsic dimension (number of degrees of freedom) of data have limitations such as reliance on careful hyperparameter tuning, poor scalability to high dimensions, and lack of robustness to noise. 
- Score based models (SBMs) are powerful deep generative models but can be sensitive to small input perturbations (adversarial examples) and lack interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes enhancing SBMs by encouraging the "local averaging property" of score functions, meaning the score at a point should match the average score in its neighborhood. This is achieved by regularizing the model with Dirichlet energy.
- It is shown theoretically and empirically that this regularization adds variance specifically along directions normal to the learned manifold, allowing the use of adversarial attacks to measure the dimension of the variance learned normal to the manifold. This provides an estimate of the topological dimension captured by the SBM.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes connection between Dirichlet energy regularization of SBMs and increasing robustness to adversarial examples by smoothing likelihood surface
- Proves Dirichlet energy regularization leads specifically to extra variance learned normal to the manifold direction
- Introduces new method to estimate topological dimension by using adversarial attacks to probe variance learned normal to manifold
- Achieves state-of-the-art topological dimension estimates, especially on higher-dim and noisy data

In summary, the paper enhances deep generative models using Dirichlet energy regularization, which provides adversarial robustness and a way to interpretably estimate topological dimension based on the learned manifold geometry. This represents an advance in enhancing model robustness and interpretability.
