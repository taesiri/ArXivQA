# [TWINS: A Fine-Tuning Framework for Improved Transferability of   Adversarial Robustness and Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11135)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that the robustness of large-scale pre-trained models like ResNet50 can be better transferred to downstream classification tasks through more effective fine-tuning methods. 

Specifically, the authors evaluate current approaches (data-based and model-based) for retaining robustness from pre-training during fine-tuning, and show these do not substantially improve robustness on the downstream tasks. 

To address this, they propose a new method called TWINS that uses a subtle statistics-based approach to maintain robust statistics from pre-training in the downstream tasks. This is hypothesized to help transfer robustness. The authors also analyze TWINS and find it provides benefits in terms of training dynamics like escaping poor initializations faster.

The effectiveness of TWINS for transferring robustness and improving generalization is evaluated experimentally on a range of image classification datasets. The central hypothesis is that TWINS will outperform current approaches for fine-tuning to transfer robustness from large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks. The experiments aim to demonstrate this.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that the proposed TWINS method will enable more effective transfer of robustness from large-scale pre-trained models to various downstream classification tasks, through maintaining robust statistics and providing improved training dynamics. The experiments test this hypothesis.
