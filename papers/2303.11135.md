# [TWINS: A Fine-Tuning Framework for Improved Transferability of   Adversarial Robustness and Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11135)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that the robustness of large-scale pre-trained models like ResNet50 can be better transferred to downstream classification tasks through more effective fine-tuning methods. 

Specifically, the authors evaluate current approaches (data-based and model-based) for retaining robustness from pre-training during fine-tuning, and show these do not substantially improve robustness on the downstream tasks. 

To address this, they propose a new method called TWINS that uses a subtle statistics-based approach to maintain robust statistics from pre-training in the downstream tasks. This is hypothesized to help transfer robustness. The authors also analyze TWINS and find it provides benefits in terms of training dynamics like escaping poor initializations faster.

The effectiveness of TWINS for transferring robustness and improving generalization is evaluated experimentally on a range of image classification datasets. The central hypothesis is that TWINS will outperform current approaches for fine-tuning to transfer robustness from large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks. The experiments aim to demonstrate this.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that the proposed TWINS method will enable more effective transfer of robustness from large-scale pre-trained models to various downstream classification tasks, through maintaining robust statistics and providing improved training dynamics. The experiments test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. It investigates the utility of robust pre-trained models like ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet with adversarial training) for improving adversarial robustness in various downstream classification tasks. Prior work has not really explored using large-scale robust pre-trained models in this way.

2. It evaluates common data-based and model-based approaches for retaining robustness from pre-training during fine-tuning, and shows these approaches fail to substantially improve robustness on the tested datasets. 

3. It proposes a new approach called TWINS that uses fixed batch normalization statistics from the pre-trained model in one network branch during fine-tuning. This helps retain robust pre-trained representations while also providing training dynamics benefits.

4. It provides analysis and experiments demonstrating TWINS' benefits for escaping poor initializations faster and mitigating robust overfitting during adversarial training.

5. Experiments on 5 datasets show TWINS improves clean accuracy and robustness over standard adversarial training methods like AT and TRADES when fine-tuning robust ResNet50 models. On average it improves clean accuracy by 2.18% and robust accuracy by 1.21% over AT.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal and extensive evaluation of the TWINS fine-tuning approach for effectively transferring robustness from large-scale pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. The analysis of its benefits is also a significant contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning framework called TWINS for improving the transferability of adversarial robustness and generalization from large-scale robustly pre-trained models to downstream tasks. TWINS maintains two networks that share weights - one with fixed batch normalization statistics from pre-training for preserving robustness and one with adaptive statistics for learning - which helps retain robust pre-trained representations while enabling faster optimization dynamics like escaping poor local minima faster and alleviating robust overfitting. Experiments on several image classification datasets demonstrate TWINS' effectiveness over standard adversarial training methods in improving accuracy and robustness when fine-tuning robustly pre-trained models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several contributions to the field of adversarial robustness and transfer learning:

- It focuses specifically on fine-tuning large-scale adversarially pre-trained models (like ResNet or ViT pre-trained on ImageNet) for improved robustness on downstream tasks. Much prior work has studied robustness primarily in the context of training from scratch on smaller datasets. 

- It systematically evaluates existing approaches like Learning Without Forgetting and joint training for retaining robustness from pre-training. The paper shows these methods are not very effective for large-scale transfer.

- It proposes a new method called TWINS that uses fixed batch normalization statistics from pre-training to help maintain robustness. Experiments show TWINS improves robust accuracy over standard fine-tuning.

- Beyond just preserving robustness, the paper provides analysis and experiments demonstrating TWINS also improves training dynamics. By decoupling weight norms and gradients, TWINS enables faster escaping from poor initializations and reduced overfitting.

- The paper includes extensive experiments on multiple datasets like CIFAR and Caltech-256 that demonstrate the effectiveness of TWINS over methods like adversarial training and TRADES. On average TWINS improves clean and robust accuracy.

So in summary, this paper makes both methodological and empirical contributions for fine-tuning large robust models, an important direction as pre-training becomes more prevalent. The proposed TWINS method and analysis of its training dynamics are novel. The paper is one of the most extensive studies of robust transfer learning on diverse datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Develop more effective methods for retaining the robustness learned during pre-training when fine-tuning on downstream tasks. The authors propose TWINS as one approach, but suggest there is room for improvement.

- Extend the study to other types of pre-trained models besides ResNet, such as vision transformers (ViT). The authors mention that TWINS could likely be adapted to work with ViT since it uses layer normalization.

- Evaluate the approach on a wider range of downstream tasks beyond image classification. The paper focuses on classification but the ideas could apply more broadly. 

- Investigate how the approach could work in other domains like natural language processing, where pre-trained models are also widely used. The overall concept of retaining beneficial statistics during fine-tuning could be relevant.

- Analyze in more detail the dynamics of how TWINS affects the gradient during training to provide more theoretical understanding. The paper makes some empirical observations but more analysis could be done.

- Study how the ideas could be incorporated into other adversarial training methods beyond just AT and TRADES. The TWINS framework may be compatible with other methods as well.

- Evaluate performance on more complex adversarial attacks. The robustness benefits are shown against PGD and AutoAttack but testing against other attacks could reveal strengths/weaknesses.

- Consider combining TWINS with other regularization methods that improve adversarial robustness and analyze potential synergies.

Overall, the authors propose TWINS as a promising approach for improving fine-tuning, but suggest quite a few avenues for extending it and gaining more insight in future work. The key theme is leveraging pre-training better for downstream tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on the fine-tuning of large-scale robust pre-trained models, such as an adversarially trained ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet, for downstream image classification tasks. The authors first evaluate common data-based and model-based approaches for retaining robustness during fine-tuning, and find they are not very effective. They then propose a statistics-based method called TWINS, which maintains two networks - one with fixed batch normalization (BN) statistics from pre-training and one with adaptive BN statistics. This helps retain robust pre-training information while also providing training dynamics benefits like faster optimization and reduced overfitting. Experiments on various datasets show TWINS fine-tuning improves accuracy and robustness over standard adversarial training methods when starting from a robust pre-trained model. The results demonstrate the promise of leveraging robust pre-trained models for downstream tasks using proper fine-tuning techniques like TWINS.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel fine-tuning framework called TWINS for improving the transferability of adversarial robustness and generalization from pre-trained models to downstream tasks. The key idea is to maintain two networks during fine-tuning - one with fixed batch normalization (BN) statistics from pre-training (Frozen Net), and one with adaptive BN statistics that get updated on the downstream data (Adaptive Net). 

The Frozen Net helps retain robust information learned during pre-training, while the Adaptive Net learns the downstream task. Having fixed BN stats in one branch breaks the relationship between weight norms and gradient norms, allowing TWINS to increase gradient magnitudes without hurting training stability. This helps TWINS escape suboptimal initializations faster and reduces robust overfitting. Experiments on image classification datasets show TWINS outperforms standard adversarial training methods in accuracy and robustness. The improvements demonstrate the potential of pre-trained robust models when effective fine-tuning is used. Overall, TWINS provides an effective statistics-based approach to transfer robustness and improve generalization in fine-tuning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a two-wing batch normalization (TWINS) fine-tuning framework for improved transferability of adversarial robustness and generalization from pre-trained models. 

The key idea is to use two networks during fine-tuning - an "Adaptive Net" with regular batch normalization layers that learn BN statistics from the target dataset, and a "Frozen Net" that fixes the BN statistics to those of the pre-trained model. Both networks share parameters except for the BN layers. 

The loss function incorporates losses from both Adaptive and Frozen nets on different mini-batches. This allows retaining robustness information from pre-training via the Frozen Net while also adapting to the target dataset via the Adaptive Net. 

Additionally, TWINS breaks the relationship between weight norm and gradient norm that holds for standard BN, allowing it to increase gradient magnitudes without hurting training stability. This helps escape poor local optima faster and reduces robust overfitting.

Experiments on several image classification datasets demonstrate TWINS' effectiveness over standard adversarial training methods in improving accuracy and robustness when fine-tuning from an adversarially pre-trained model. The proposed approach leverages pre-training statistics for better transferability while also improving training dynamics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It focuses on the fine-tuning of large-scale robust pre-trained models (e.g. ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet with adversarial training) for downstream classification tasks. 

- It first evaluates two common approaches for retaining robustness from pre-training: model-based (using LwF regularization) and data-based (joint training on target data and pre-training data). It shows these approaches fail to substantially improve robustness and accuracy on the downstream tasks.

- It proposes a new method called TWINS that maintains two networks - one with fixed batch normalization (BN) statistics from pre-training and one with adaptive BN. This subtler approach helps transfer robustness while also providing training dynamics benefits.

- TWINS is shown to improve upon standard adversarial training and TRADES across 5 image classification datasets, in both clean accuracy and robustness to adversarial examples.

In summary, the key question is how to effectively transfer the robustness learned by large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks via fine-tuning. The paper proposes TWINS as an improved way to retain robustness compared to prior model- and data-based approaches.
