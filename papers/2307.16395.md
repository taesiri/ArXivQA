# [Bridging the Gap: Exploring the Capabilities of Bridge-Architectures for   Complex Visual Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16395)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:1) Does incorporating object level local features help bridge architectures in performing complex visual reasoning tasks like NLVR2?2) Is visuo-linguistic pretraining necessary for good performance on multimodal tasks like NLVR2 that require complex reasoning? 3) Is multimodal instruction finetuning necessary for bridge architectures to perform well on complex reasoning tasks?The key hypothesis appears to be that incorporating object-level local features and visuo-linguistic pretraining will improve the performance of bridge architectures on complex visual reasoning tasks like NLVR2. The authors seem to investigate this by adding object-level features from models like SAM to bridge architectures, and analyzing the performance with and without visuo-linguistic pretraining. They also study the impact of multimodal instruction finetuning on models like LLaVA.Through their experiments and analysis, the authors aim to demonstrate that object-level features and pretraining are important for bridge architectures to work well on complex visual reasoning tasks that require fine-grained understanding of images and text. The instruction finetuning is also hypothesized to be beneficial.In summary, the central questions focus on understanding how to enable bridge architectures to perform well on complex multimodal reasoning tasks through adding object-level visual features and visuo-linguistic pretraining. The role of instruction finetuning is also analyzed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- The authors introduce and explore the capabilities of "bridge architectures" for complex visual reasoning tasks. Bridge architectures project image features into the text space of large language models (LLMs) using a linear mapping, to leverage the reasoning abilities of LLMs. - They analyze the performance of bridge architectures on the NLVR2 dataset, which requires complex reasoning over image pairs and text.

The results demonstrate these models' limitations currently, and the importance of multi-modal pre-training for strong performance. The paper also provides insights into how bridge architectures could be improved.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper presents an analysis of bridge architectures for multimodal reasoning on the NLVR2 dataset. It finds that multimodal pretraining and instruction finetuning are crucial for bridge architectures to perform well on complex reasoning tasks like NLVR2. The key takeaway is that without multimodal pretraining, bridge architectures struggle on tasks requiring fine-grained visual reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in vision-language tasks and multimodal learning:- It focuses on investigating complex visual reasoning capabilities of models, using NLVR2 as a challenging benchmark dataset. Many prior works have evaluated models on simpler multimodal tasks like image captioning or visual question answering. Examining performance on compositional reasoning is an important direction.- The paper explores recent "bridge architectures" like LLaVA that project image features into the text space of a language model. Most prior work has used multi-modal transformers with cross-attention between visual and text tokens. Studying bridge architectures is novel.- The analysis indicates these bridge models currently underperform on NLVR2 compared to heavily pretrained multi-modal transformers. But techniques like chain of thought prompting in LLaVA show promise for improving reasoning.- The paper emphasizes the importance of pretraining both the visual and text encoders on large multimodal datasets. Many prior works pretrain both, while bridge models often just use a pretrained image encoder. The results suggest joint pretraining is critical.- Adding local visual features from object detection models is analyzed as a way to improve reasoning, since NLVR2 requires fine-grained understanding. This investigation of how to incorporate local and global features is not seen in most prior work.- Overall, the paper provides one of the most systematic studies analyzing factors like pretraining, architecture designs, prompting methods, etc. in the context of complex reasoning tasks. The insights on when bridge architectures succeed or struggle are novel.In summary, the paper advances research on visually-grounded reasoning by carefully examining recent methods on a challenging task, introducing techniques to improve bridge models, and providing an analysis of what capabilities are still lacking. The focus on reasoning and bridge architectures distinguishes it from much of the closely related literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Pretraining the image encoder of bridge architectures like LLaVA on multimodal instruction data. The authors hypothesize that the lack of multimodal pretraining for the image encoder is a key limitation of current bridge architectures. Pretraining the image encoder on multimodal instructions could help improve performance on complex visual reasoning tasks.- Finetuning the linear projection layer of LLaVA on the NLVR2 dataset. The authors were unable to do this due to resource constraints, but suggest it as an important experiment to compare against finetuning results of other models like ViLT and X-VLM.- Using conversational prompting and reasoning over multiple turns to improve LLaVA's performance. The authors suggest LLaVA could benefit from a more step-by-step reasoning approach.- Pretraining a smaller LLaVA model using explanations generated from a larger LLaVA model. The authors suggest bootstrapping a smaller model with explanations from a larger model could improve zero-shot performance.- Evaluating LLaVA on more complex reasoning datasets like Winograd Schema Challenge and CLEVR. This could better analyze LLaVA's reasoning abilities.- Modifying LLaVA to take two images as input instead of fusing images. The authors found fusing images led to confusion between object properties.- Analyzing if concatenating images hurts other multimodal models designed for single images. The authors plan to study if using two images degrades performance.- Using CLIP adapters to make image encoder pretraining more efficient. The authors suggest pretraining all of CLIP is expensive and suggest CLIP adapters as an alternative.- Studying model biases, environmental impact, data privacy, and other ethical concerns around large pretrained models. The authors identify several important ethical considerations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores the capabilities of "bridge" architectures for complex visual reasoning tasks compared to traditional transformer-based multimodal models. Bridge architectures leverage large language models (LLMs) by projecting image embeddings into the text space and utilizing the auto-regressive capacity of LLMs for tasks like VQA and captioning. These models deviate from traditional approaches which use large-scale pre-training and complex multi-modal interactions through attention. The paper investigates bridge architecture performance on the NLVR2 dataset, which requires fine-grained visual reasoning. They first extend traditional bridge architectures by adding object-level features from models like Faster R-CNN to facilitate reasoning. However, their analysis shows that adding object features does not help much, and pre-training on multi-modal data is key for good NLVR2 performance. They also demonstrate initial results using the LLaVA bridge architecture in a zero-shot setting, showing some promising capabilities but overall poor performance compared to state-of-the-art models, indicating the importance of multi-modal pre-training. The key conclusions are that object-level features alone do not help bridge architectures without multi-modal pre-training, and pre-training on multi-modal data is critical for complex reasoning tasks like NLVR2.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores the capabilities of bridge architectures, which project image embeddings into the text space and leverage language models, for complex visual reasoning tasks. The authors focus on the NLVR2 dataset, which requires compositional reasoning about image pairs and text. They first extend traditional bridge architectures by incorporating object-level features from models like SAM, in addition to global image features from CLIP, to facilitate fine-grained reasoning. However, their experiments show that adding object features to bridge architectures without multimodal pretraining does not improve performance on NLVR2. The authors then analyze recent pretrained bridge architectures like LLaVA and compare them to Transformer-based models like ViLT and X-VLM. They find that visuo-linguistic pretraining is critical for strong NLVR2 performance, and finetuning the image encoder via task instructions can further help bridge architectures leverage language models' reasoning capabilities. Qualitative analysis reveals bridge architectures struggle with complex reasoning requiring differentiation between fine details in image pairs. The authors conclude pretraining on multimodal data is key for complex visual reasoning tasks, and plan to explore adapters to make image encoder pretraining more efficient.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method used in the paper is a bridge architecture for multimodal reasoning. The key aspects are:- They use a pre-trained image encoder like CLIP to extract image features. - They then project these image features into the text space of a pre-trained language model like T5 using a learned linear projection matrix. This acts as a "bridge" between the vision and language domains.- The text sequence containing the projected image embeddings and text is then passed through the language model, which is either used in a zero-shot setting or finetuned on the downstream task. The language model's generation capabilities are leveraged for reasoning.- For the NLVR2 task specifically, they incorporate object-level features from a segmentation model like SAM in addition to the global CLIP features. The goal is to provide finer-grained visual information to facilitate complex visual reasoning.- They analyze different variations like using different encoders, adding instruction fine-tuning, and prompting the language model to reason through a chain of thought. The key result is that pre-training both encoders on multimodal data seems crucial for strong performance on NLVR2.In summary, the core of the approach is projecting images into text space and leveraging language models for multimodal reasoning, instead of more complex multimodal pre-training and cross-attention. The tradeoffs with this bridge architecture are analyzed for visual reasoning.
