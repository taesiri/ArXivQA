# Bridging the Gap: Exploring the Capabilities of Bridge-Architectures for   Complex Visual Reasoning Tasks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:1) Does incorporating object level local features help bridge architectures in performing complex visual reasoning tasks like NLVR2?2) Is visuo-linguistic pretraining necessary for good performance on multimodal tasks like NLVR2 that require complex reasoning? 3) Is multimodal instruction finetuning necessary for bridge architectures to perform well on complex reasoning tasks?The key hypothesis appears to be that incorporating object-level local features and visuo-linguistic pretraining will improve the performance of bridge architectures on complex visual reasoning tasks like NLVR2. The authors seem to investigate this by adding object-level features from models like SAM to bridge architectures, and analyzing the performance with and without visuo-linguistic pretraining. They also study the impact of multimodal instruction finetuning on models like LLaVA.Through their experiments and analysis, the authors aim to demonstrate that object-level features and pretraining are important for bridge architectures to work well on complex visual reasoning tasks that require fine-grained understanding of images and text. The instruction finetuning is also hypothesized to be beneficial.In summary, the central questions focus on understanding how to enable bridge architectures to perform well on complex multimodal reasoning tasks through adding object-level visual features and visuo-linguistic pretraining. The role of instruction finetuning is also analyzed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- The authors introduce and explore the capabilities of "bridge architectures" for complex visual reasoning tasks. Bridge architectures project image features into the text space of large language models (LLMs) using a linear mapping, to leverage the reasoning abilities of LLMs. - They analyze the performance of bridge architectures on the NLVR2 dataset, which requires complex reasoning over image pairs and text. They augment bridge architectures with object-level features from segmentation models to facilitate fine-grained reasoning.- Through experiments, they demonstrate that simply adding object features to bridge architectures does not help much. Pre-training on multi-modal data seems key for good performance on complex tasks like NLVR2. - They show initial results analyzing the recently proposed LLaVA bridge architecture on NLVR2. Using chain of thought prompting improves LLaVA's zero-shot reasoning abilities. But there is still a large gap compared to state-of-the-art finetuned models, indicating the importance of multi-modal pre-training.In summary, the key contribution is an analysis of bridge architectures on a complex visual reasoning task. The results demonstrate these models' limitations currently, and the importance of multi-modal pre-training for strong performance. The paper also provides insights into how bridge architectures could be improved.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper presents an analysis of bridge architectures for multimodal reasoning on the NLVR2 dataset. It finds that multimodal pretraining and instruction finetuning are crucial for bridge architectures to perform well on complex reasoning tasks like NLVR2. The key takeaway is that without multimodal pretraining, bridge architectures struggle on tasks requiring fine-grained visual reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in vision-language tasks and multimodal learning:- It focuses on investigating complex visual reasoning capabilities of models, using NLVR2 as a challenging benchmark dataset. Many prior works have evaluated models on simpler multimodal tasks like image captioning or visual question answering. Examining performance on compositional reasoning is an important direction.- The paper explores recent "bridge architectures" like LLaVA that project image features into the text space of a language model. Most prior work has used multi-modal transformers with cross-attention between visual and text tokens. Studying bridge architectures is novel.- The analysis indicates these bridge models currently underperform on NLVR2 compared to heavily pretrained multi-modal transformers. But techniques like chain of thought prompting in LLaVA show promise for improving reasoning.- The paper emphasizes the importance of pretraining both the visual and text encoders on large multimodal datasets. Many prior works pretrain both, while bridge models often just use a pretrained image encoder. The results suggest joint pretraining is critical.- Adding local visual features from object detection models is analyzed as a way to improve reasoning, since NLVR2 requires fine-grained understanding. This investigation of how to incorporate local and global features is not seen in most prior work.- Overall, the paper provides one of the most systematic studies analyzing factors like pretraining, architecture designs, prompting methods, etc. in the context of complex reasoning tasks. The insights on when bridge architectures succeed or struggle are novel.In summary, the paper advances research on visually-grounded reasoning by carefully examining recent methods on a challenging task, introducing techniques to improve bridge models, and providing an analysis of what capabilities are still lacking. The focus on reasoning and bridge architectures distinguishes it from much of the closely related literature.
