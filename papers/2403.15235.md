# [Multi-perspective Memory Enhanced Network for Identifying Key Nodes in   Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying influential nodes ("key nodes") in social networks is important for limiting the spread of false information. 
- Existing methods for identifying key nodes have some limitations:
   - They typically only consider network structure, not user attributes.
   - They have limited generalization ability to new scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Multi-perspective Memory Enhanced Network (MMEN) to identify key nodes. The key ideas are:

1. Construct two isomorphic propagation networks: 
   - A user attribute network based on user profiles.
   - A propagation structure network based on graph sampling.

2. Enhance graphs with a memory module:
   - Use a graph attention network to update node representations. 
   - Store/retrieve representations of similar subgraphs in a memory module. This enhances generalization.

3. Fuse perspectives with adaptive weights:
   - Predict node influence from both attribute and structure graphs.
   - Learn adaptive weights to aggregate predictions.

Main Contributions:

- Novel network architecture to fuse multiple perspectives with memory enhancement for identifying key nodes. 
- Constructs graphs based on user attributes and propagation structure.
- Uses memory networks to store/retrieve similar subgraph representations, improving generalization.
- Experiments show the approach significantly outperforms previous methods in identifying influential nodes.
