# [HT-LIP Model based Robust Control of Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion under   Unknown Vertical Ground Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust quadrupedal locomotion on dynamic rigid surfaces (DRS) with unknown and general vertical motions, such as the pitching and heaving of ships and airplanes. Existing quadrupedal locomotion controllers typically assume a static ground and may fail on DRSes. Controlling legged robots on DRSes is difficult due to the complex, hybrid, nonlinear, time-varying, underactuated, and high-dimensional robot dynamics.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a hierarchical control framework to achieve robust trotting on DRSes. The key novelty lies in the higher control layer, which uses a new discrete-time footstep controller based on a hybrid time-varying linear inverted pendulum (HT-LIP) model that accurately captures the essential locomotion dynamics on pitching/heaving DRSes. New sufficient stability conditions are derived to guide the footstep controller design and ensure asymptotic stability even under unknown DRS motions. The footstep controller is formulated as a quadratic program (QP) that updates in real-time while optimizing convergence rate and satisfying stability and feasibility constraints. The middle layer plans feasible full-body motions based on the footstep locations. The lower layer tracks the full-body trajectories using torque control.

Main Contributions:
1) Introduction of the HT-LIP model that extends existing LIP models to enable analysis of hybrid locomotion dynamics on general vertical DRS motions.

2) Construction of a discrete-time footstep controller and associated stability conditions to provably stabilize the HT-LIP system under unknown, varying DRS motions and gait timing.  

3) Formulation of a QP-based real-time footstep optimization that enforces stability and respects physical constraints.

4) Design and stability analysis of a hierarchical control framework incorporating the HT-LIP footstep controller for robust quadrupedal trotting on DRSes.  

5) Hardware experiments validating stable trotting under various unknown DRS motions, pushes, loads, slippery surfaces, etc.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a hierarchical control framework with a novel higher-layer footstep planner based on a proposed hybrid time-varying linear inverted pendulum model to achieve robust quadrupedal trotting on surfaces with unknown and general vertical motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new reduced-order model called the hybrid time-varying linear inverted pendulum (HT-LIP) model to describe the essential hybrid dynamics of quadrupedal robots trotting on dynamic rigid surfaces (DRSes) with general unknown vertical motions.

2. It derives a new set of sufficient stability conditions for the discrete-time footstep controller to asymptotically stabilize the HT-LIP model under unknown DRS vertical motions. 

3. It formulates the footstep controller as a quadratic program (QP) that respects the stability conditions and can be solved efficiently in real-time to generate optimal footholds while ensuring locomotion stability.

4. It develops a hierarchical control framework incorporating the HT-LIP model and QP-based footstep planning for robust quadrupedal trotting on DRSes. The framework is validated through experiments on a Unitree quadruped performing stable trotting on a treadmill with various unknown vertical motions and disturbances.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution is using the proposed HT-LIP model and associated stability theory to enable efficient footstep planning and provably stable locomotion control on unknown, dynamic surfaces.
