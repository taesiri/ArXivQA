# [Label-Noise Robust Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17517)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in conditional image generation tasks, but training them requires large-scale datasets which often contain noisy labels. 
- Noisy labels lead to condition mismatch and quality degradation of generated images in conditional diffusion models.
- There has been little study on training conditional diffusion models with noisy labels. Existing methods from GAN models are not directly applicable due to the different nature of the diffusion modeling objective.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Transition-aware Weighted Denoising Score Matching (TDSM) objective to train conditional diffusion models with noisy labels. 
- It first shows a linear relationship between noisy-label and clean-label conditional scores based on instance-wise, time-dependent label transition probabilities.
- Then it proposes the TDSM objective which uses a weighted sum of score networks based on these transition probabilities.
- To estimate the weights, it introduces a transition matrix and time-dependent noisy label classifier tailored to the diffusion process.

Main Contributions:
- First study on training conditional diffusion models with noisy labels
- Proves a linear relationship between noisy-label and clean-label conditional scores based on label transition probabilities
- Proposes the TDSM objective using a weighted sum of score networks with transition-based weights  
- Introduces an estimator to compute the weights using a transition matrix and tailored noisy label classifier
- Experiments show improved sample quality and conditional metrics compared to baselines across datasets and noise settings
- Shows TDSM can improve performance even on top of other noisy label corrections, highlighting it as an orthogonal contribution

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards making diffusion models robust to label noise for conditional image generation.
