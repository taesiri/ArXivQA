# [World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing world models for model-based reinforcement learning are autoregressive - they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows due to the autoregressive nature. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel world modelling approach called Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD) that is non-autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. 

Key Ideas:
- PolyGRAD utilizes a learned denoising model and the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to gradually diffuse an initially random trajectory into an on-policy synthetic trajectory.

- It starts with a trajectory of random states and actions and iteratively refines it over many diffusion steps using the denoising model to predict states and the policy gradient to update actions.

- The denoising model ensures accurate prediction of environment dynamics while the policy gradient guides the trajectory to be on-policy.

- PolyGRAD can be viewed as using a score-based model to generate on-policy actions or an instance of classifier-guided diffusion.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes PolyGRAD - the first scalable non-autoregressive approach for on-policy world modeling and trajectory generation.

- Analyzes connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models and classifier-guided diffusion.  

- Demonstrates PolyGRAD's improved trajectory prediction accuracy over baselines except autoregressive diffusion, for moderate trajectory lengths.

- Shows PolyGRAD enables training performant policies via on-policy RL in imagination on MuJoCo domains, using only synthetic data.

- Introduces a new paradigm for scalable and accurate non-autoregressive world modelling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for scalable and non-autoregressive on-policy world modelling by using diffusion to gradually diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory, guided by a denoising model and the gradient of the policy action distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Proposing PolyGRAD, the first scalable approach to world modelling that enables on-policy trajectory generation without autoregressive sampling. PolyGRAD is a novel world modelling method that generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass of diffusion, overcoming the limitation of previous world models that generate trajectories autoregressively. The key ideas are using diffusion to gradually diffuse an initial trajectory of random states and actions into an on-policy trajectory, while using the policy gradient to guide the action sequence towards on-policy actions.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing a new non-autoregressive paradigm for scalable and accurate world modelling using policy-guided trajectory diffusion.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- World Models - Predictive models of environment dynamics for model-based reinforcement learning.

- Trajectory Diffusion - Using a diffusion model to iteratively refine and generate entire trajectories of states and actions. 

- Policy-Guided - Using the policy to guide the diffusion process to on-policy trajectories.

- Non-Autoregressive - Generating complete trajectories in one pass rather than autoregressively predicting one step at a time.

- Score-Based Generative Models - Diffusion models are a type of score-based model that learns the gradient of the data distribution.

- Classifier Guidance - Modifying the sampling distribution by adding the gradient of a classifier, used here to guide sampling to a particular policy. 

- On-Policy Reinforcement Learning - Training reinforcement learning agents on data generated by the current policy. Enabled in imagination by PolyGRAD.

- Deep Reinforcement Learning - Using neural network policies and critics to enable reinforcement learning in complex environments.

So in summary, the key ideas are using diffusion models for non-autoregressive trajectory generation, leveraging policy gradients for guidance, and enabling complex policies to be trained via on-policy reinforcement learning in imagination.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a non-autoregressive approach to world modeling using policy-guided trajectory diffusion (PolyGRAD). How does PolyGRAD address the issue of error accumulation in autoregressive world models over long prediction horizons? What are the theoretical underpinnings behind using diffusion in conjunction with policy guidance to generate full imagined trajectories?

2) PolyGRAD utilizes two learned components - a denoising model and a policy model. What is the purpose of each of these models in the overall framework of trajectory generation? How do these two models interact to iteratively refine and guide the imagined trajectories? 

3) The paper draws connections between PolyGRAD and both score-based generative modeling and classifier-guided diffusion. Can you explain these connections in detail? How does understanding these relationships provide justification and insight into why PolyGRAD can generate on-policy trajectories?

4) What modifications need to be made to the standard diffusion training objective in order to add action-conditioning when training the PolyGRAD denoising model? Why is action-conditioning important for enabling the denoising model to make accurate predictions?  

5) When performing policy-guided updates to the action sequence in PolyGRAD, why does the paper use the score of the policy action distribution rather than the gradient with respect to the policy parameters? What are the implications of using the policy score?

6) PolyGRAD requires careful tuning of the action update scale hyperparameter delta. The paper proposes an automatic tuning scheme - can you explain how this scheme works? Why is it important to ensure delta is set appropriately?

7) The paper ablates several modifications to PolyGRAD - Random Actions, Policy Sampling, etc. Pick one of these ablations and explain in detail why it performs poorly compared to the base PolyGRAD algorithm.

8) What modifications need to be made to the standard RL training loop in order to train policies using imagined data from PolyGRAD world models? Why is policy update stability an important consideration?

9) The paper observes worse RL performance from PolyGRAD compared to Dreamer-v3, despite better prediction accuracy from PolyGRAD. Provide possible hypotheses that could explain this finding.

10) PolyGRAD struggles to produce the correct action distribution when the policy entropy is very low. Speculate on the reasons for this limitation and propose methods that could alleviate this issue.
