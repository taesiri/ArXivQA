## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on downstream tasks requires lots of compute and data, limiting their accessibility. 
- Multi-modal models like vision-language models require architectural changes or full fine-tuning, further increasing resource requirements.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Context-PEFT, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that learns different groups of adaptor parameters based on the token's domain or modality.
- Apply various PEFT techniques like LoRA, BitFit, IA3 in a context-specific way without needing architectural modifications.
- Show it works for adapting a pretrained language model to accept visual inputs for the image captioning task.

Key Contributions:
- Propose Context-PEFT framework to efficiently fine-tune models on multi-modal, multi-task scenarios.
- Show superior performance over full fine-tuning for image captioning using the COCO dataset, with higher efficiency.
- Demonstrate Context-PEFT works with various underlying PEFT methods like Context-LoRA, Context-BitFit etc.
- Analyze effect of adapting different layers, hyperparameter choices, vision encoder model capacity etc. 
- Suggest wide range of applications and future work for Context-PEFT framework.

In summary, the paper introduces Context-PEFT as an efficient way to adapt pretrained models to multiple modalities/tasks by learning separate adaptor parameters per domain without architectural changes. It shows strong performance for low-resource image captioning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Context-PEFT, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task transfer learning that learns different groups of adaptor parameters based on the token's domain to efficiently adapt pre-trained language models to other modalities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of Context-PEFT, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for multi-modal, multi-task transfer learning with pre-trained language models. Specifically:

- Context-PEFT learns different groups of adaptor parameters based on the token's domain or purpose (e.g. text vs image tokens). This allows efficient adaptation without requiring architectural changes.

- The paper shows that Context-PEFT outperforms full fine-tuning of language models on the COCO image captioning task under similar data constraints, while being much more parameter and computationally efficient. 

- The paper validates Context-PEFT with several different PEFT techniques like LoRA, BitFit and IA3, and shows consistent improvements from making them context-specific over context-agnostic versions.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the Context-PEFT framework for efficient multi-modal fine-tuning of language models by learning separate adaptor parameters for different modalities/contexts.
