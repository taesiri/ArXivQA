# [Integrating AI into CCTV Systems: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Smart   Video Surveillance in Community Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02078)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents and evaluates an AI-based real-time smart video surveillance system that integrates with existing CCTV infrastructure for enhanced safety and operational efficiency in community spaces like educational institutions and small businesses. The system comprises AI nodes for video analysis, a server node for storage and analysis, a cloud node for communications, and user apps for notifications. It uses metadata instead of pixel data for privacy-preserving anomaly recognition. Comprehensive real-world experiments are conducted in a community college with 16 cameras. The system maintains 16.5 FPS throughput and 26.76 seconds average end-to-end latency in detecting and alerting behavioral anomalies across 21 hours of operation. Experiments with 4 to 16 cameras show the effectiveness and scalability of the system, although increased latency and reduced throughput are observed with more cameras. The evaluations cover AI pipeline optimization, load stress testing, anomaly detection latency, and long duration robustness assessment. This pioneering study demonstrates the real-world applicability of AI-driven video surveillance and sets benchmarks for further research towards wide-scale community adoption.
