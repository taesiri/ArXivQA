# [Beyond Expected Return: Accounting for Policy Reproducibility when   Evaluating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07178)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper formalizes the concept of "policy reproducibility" in reinforcement learning, defined as the ability of a policy to obtain similar performance when rolled out multiple times in uncertain environments. The authors propose using the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Interquartile Range (IQR) as robust statistical measures to quantify a policy's reproducibility. To account for this reproducibility when evaluating and comparing RL policies, they advocate using the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) of the return distribution rather than just the commonly used expected return. The LCB allows setting a preference hyperparameter α to control the tradeoff between performance and reproducibility. Through extensive experiments on common RL algorithms and benchmarks, the authors demonstrate the benefit of using LCB over expected return for policy evaluation. They also extend their analysis to quantify and account for behavior reproducibility in addition to return reproducibility. Overall, this work provides useful statistical tools and evaluation procedures to incorporate policy reproducibility, an often overlooked but important consideration for real-world deployment of RL.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using the Lower Confidence Bound metric to account for policy reproducibility when evaluating and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms in uncertain environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Formalizing the concept of "policy reproducibility" in reinforcement learning, which refers to the ability of a policy to obtain similar performance and behaviors when rolled out multiple times in uncertain environments. 

2) Proposing robust statistical measures like Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Interquartile Range (IQR) to quantify policy reproducibility.

3) Advocating the use of Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) of the return distribution as an alternative metric to the commonly used expected return to account for the trade-off between performance and reproducibility when evaluating and comparing RL policies.

4) Demonstrating via experiments that there exists a performance-reproducibility trade-off for common RL algorithms, which can be effectively evaluated using the proposed LCB metric. 

5) Extending the analysis to also consider behavior reproducibility in addition to return reproducibility.

In summary, the paper highlights an important but overlooked issue of policy reproducibility in uncertain RL environments, provides metrics to quantify it, and shows how accounting for reproducibility leads to more meaningful evaluation of policies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Policy reproducibility - The ability of a policy to obtain similar performance and behaviors when rolled out many times in uncertain domains. Defined as the statistical dispersion of the return distribution of a policy.

- Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) - A robust statistical measure proposed to quantify policy reproducibility. 

- Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) - A metric that accounts for the trade-off between expected performance of a policy and its reproducibility. Allows setting a preference between performance and reproducibility. 

- Uncertain environments - Environments with noise or stochasticity that cause policies to have distributions over possible returns rather than fixed returns.

- Heteroscedastic uncertain environments - A type of uncertain environment where the uncertainty impacts the returns of different policies differently, leading them to have different return distributions.

- Behavior reproducibility - The ability of a policy to exhibit similar behaviors when rolled out multiple times, beyond just obtaining similar returns.

Some other relevant terms are value-based methods, evolution strategies, stochastic dynamics, parameter-space noise, etc. The key focus is on policy evaluation procedures in uncertain reinforcement learning environments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) as an alternative metric to expected return for evaluating policies. How does the LCB metric allow accounting for the trade-off between performance and reproducibility? What are the limitations of using expected return?

2. The LCB metric contains a user-defined parameter α to set the relative importance of performance versus reproducibility. What considerations should go into setting this parameter for a particular application? How sensitive are the results to different values of α?

3. The paper defines policy reproducibility both in terms of returns and behaviors. What are the challenges in quantifying behavior reproducibility compared to return reproducibility? How does the choice of behavior representation impact the reproducibility metrics?

4. For quantifying return reproducibility, the paper proposes using the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Interquartile Range (IQR) metrics. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each? When would you choose one over the other?  

5. The paper shows Evolution Strategies (ES) lead to more reproducible policies than SAC and TD3. What properties of ES algorithms contribute to this? Could SAC and TD3 be modified to improve reproducibility?

6. The reproducibility-focused ES variant (R-ES) explicitly optimizes a weighted sum of performance and reproducibility. How does the relative weighting impact the trade-off? How should this weighting be set for a particular application?

7. The paper considers reproducibility for in-distribution uncertainties seen during training. Could the proposed metrics be applied for out-of-distribution cases as well? What challenges might arise?

8. For real-world applications, what other sources of uncertainty beyond the ones considered could impact policy reproducibility? How could the methods proposed be extended to account for them?

9. The LCB, MAD, and IQR metrics summarize a distribution with one number. What additional insights could representing the full distribution provide? How could this distribution be visualized?

10. The paper focuses on evaluating pre-trained policies. Could the reproducibility metrics be incorporated into the training process itself to directly optimize for reproducibility? What challenges would this introduce?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are being applied to more real-world problems which inherently have uncertainty/noise (e.g. from sensors). This causes policies learnt by RL algorithms to have a distribution of returns when evaluated multiple times.
- Commonly used evaluation metric of expected return fails to capture this distribution. It does not account for the spread/reproducibility of returns, which can be important in some applications (e.g. robotics).  

Proposed Solution:
- Formalize concept of "policy reproducibility" as the spread/dispersion of distribution of returns of a policy. Propose "Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)" and "Interquartile Range (IQR)" as robust metrics to quantify policy reproducibility.

- Propose using "Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)" of return instead of just expected return to evaluate policies. LCB allows trading off performance vs reproducibility via a tunable parameter α. For α=0, LCB becomes expected return.

- Demonstrate benefit of LCB over expected return by experimenting with popular RL algorithms (SAC, TD3, ES) on control tasks with different noise types. Evolution strategies (ES) give more reproducible but lower performing policies than SAC, TD3. The tradeoff can be effectively studied using LCB for different α values.

Main Contributions:
- Formalized policy reproducibility in RL and proposed robust statistical metrics (MAD, IQR) to quantify it
- Proposed LCB as better alternative to expected return to account for reproducibility-performance tradeoff
- Extensive experiments with different algorithms and noise types to demonstrate limitations of expected return and benefits of LCB
- Extended analysis to reproducibility of policy behavior in addition to return
