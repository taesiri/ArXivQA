# [Blind Video Deflickering by Neural Filtering with a Flawed Atlas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08120)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we develop a general blind video deflickering method that removes various types of flickering artifacts from videos, without needing any extra guidance like the flickering frequency, manual annotations, or an additional clean video?

The key points are:

- Many videos suffer from flickering artifacts due to various reasons, such as old camera hardware, lighting changes, or processing algorithms. Removing flicker is desirable for improved video quality. 

- Existing deflickering methods are designed for specific types of flicker and often require extra information like flickering frequency or an additional clean video. 

- This paper proposes a "blind deflickering" method that works on a single flickering video without any other guidance, making it widely applicable.

- The core ideas are using a neural atlas for consistency guidance and designing a neural filtering strategy to handle flaws in the atlas.

So in summary, the paper focuses on developing a generalized, blind video deflickering approach that does not rely on extra guidance, which previous specialized methods required. This allows it to handle diverse real-world flickering videos in a fully automatic way.
