# [MathVerse: Does Your Multi-modal LLM Truly See the Diagrams in Visual   Math Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14624)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) on visual math problem-solving have some limitations:
1) Excessive redundant textual information makes it unclear whether MLLMs are truly interpreting the diagrams or just relying on text
2) Simply scoring final answers as correct/incorrect fails to assess quality of intermediate reasoning 
3) Scope is too narrow (geometry-specific) or too advanced (college-level) to fully demonstrate MLLMs' capabilities

Proposed Solution - MathVerse Benchmark:
- Comprehensively collects and reviews 2,612 high-quality visual math problems across plane/solid geometry and functions
- Transforms each problem into 6 versions with decreasing textual content & increasing visual elements to thoroughly evaluate whether & how much MLLMs understand diagrams
- Introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation to extract & assess key intermediate steps from MLLM outputs, enabling finer-grained scoring and error analysis

Key Contributions:
- Rigorously investigates if MLLMs rely more on redundant text than actually seeing & understanding visual math diagrams
- Specializes in mathematical reasoning evaluation; problems are high school level to match capabilities of current MLLMs  
- CoT evaluation strategy provides granular assessment of reasoning quality and reveals insights into modes of failure
- Extensive experiments on major MLLMs reveal most still struggle with diagram interpretation & mathematical visual encoding

The MathVerse benchmark pushes the frontier of standardized evaluation for assessing and guiding advancement of MLLMs' genuine multi-modal mathematical reasoning.
