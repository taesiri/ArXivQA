# [ASH: Animatable Gaussian Splats for Efficient and Photoreal Human   Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05941)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating photorealistic and controllable human avatars in real-time is an important problem in computer vision and graphics, with applications in gaming, film production, AR/VR, etc. While recent neural implicit rendering methods like NeRF have achieved high photorealism, they are computationally expensive and only suitable for static scenes. Existing real-time methods typically lack details or photorealism.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes ASH, an Animatable Gaussian Splatting approach for real-time and high-quality rendering of humans. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the human avatar with animatable 3D Gaussian splats attached to a deformable template mesh. 

2) Learn the Gaussian parameters efficiently in the 2D texture space of the template rather than 3D. This allows leveraging efficient 2D convnets rather than 3D networks.

3) Model the mapping from body motion to Gaussian parameters as a 2D-to-2D image translation problem for further efficiency.

4) Carefully designed training strategy to handle long video sequences and clothing dynamics.

Main Contributions:

1) A new representation using animatable Gaussian splats for real-time rendering of humans.

2) An efficient learning formulation by posing the problem as 2D-to-2D translation in texture space rather than 3D. Allows scaling to large number of Gaussians.

3) Significantly outperforms prior real-time techniques and comparable quality to state-of-the-art offline methods, while being orders of magnitude faster.

4) Demonstrates photorealistic rendering of humans in real-time for the first time, enabling applications like virtual try-on, gaming and VR avatars.

In summary, the paper enables high quality and controllable rendering of human avatars in real-time by proposing animatable Gaussian splats learned efficiently in 2D texture space. This is a significant advance over prior real-time techniques.
