# [BEnQA: A Question Answering and Reasoning Benchmark for Bengali and   English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most NLP research and benchmarks focus on English and high-resource languages, neglecting medium-low resource languages like Bengali (272 million speakers). This could widen access gaps to AI technology.
- There is a lack of standardized benchmarks to evaluate reasoning skills of large language models (LLMs) in non-English languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce BEnQA, a parallel corpus of 5,161 English-Bengali science exam questions from grades 8, 10 and 12 in Bangladesh.
- The questions cover diverse subjects (math, physics, chemistry, biology) and question types (factual, application, reasoning). 
- They benchmark performance of various proprietary and open-source LLMs on this dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Found significant gaps between LLM performance on English vs Bengali questions. Proprietary models like GPT-4 perform much better than open-source ones.
- Tested prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and appending English translation to Bengali questions. CoT helps more on application and reasoning questions.  
- Translation appending boosts performance across most subjects for GPT-3.5 Turbo. The improvement also holds for other datasets like COPA and Big Bench Hard.
- The parallel English-Bengali dataset allows fairer benchmarking of models across languages. Findings indicate promise for future work in improving LLM performance in low-resource languages.

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of a new parallel English-Bengali exam QA dataset that enables standardized evaluation of reasoning skills across languages. The benchmark findings highlight gaps that can guide future work on making LLMs more inclusive across languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces BEnQA, a new parallel English-Bengali exam question dataset for benchmarking reasoning capabilities of language models, revealing performance gaps between English and Bengali and exploring methods like Chain-of-Thought prompting and appending English translation to improve Bengali performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of BEnQA, a new question answering and reasoning benchmark dataset for Bengali and English, consisting of over 5,000 exam questions from the Bangladeshi national curriculum.

2. The dataset covers multiple subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, math) and question types, including factual, application, and reasoning questions.

3. The questions are provided in parallel between English and Bengali, allowing for benchmarking of language models in both languages and analysis of performance gaps. 

4. Benchmark results highlighting significant gaps between language model performance in English versus Bengali, even for top proprietary models like GPT-4.

5. Investigation into prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and appending English translation to improve language model performance on reasoning questions in Bengali.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of a new multilingual exam QA dataset that enables more inclusive language model development and evaluation across high and low resource languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- BEnQA - The name of the new parallel English-Bengali exam question dataset introduced in the paper.

- Low-resource languages - The paper focuses specifically on improving performance of models on Bengali, which is considered a low-resource language.

- Reasoning - The BEnQA dataset contains different types of reasoning questions including factual, application, and multi-step reasoning questions. Evaluating reasoning capabilities is a key focus.

- Parallel corpus - The English and Bengali exam questions are aligned to create a parallel corpus for fair comparison.

- Prompting methods - Experiments explore different prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and appending English translation to improve model performance.

- Multilingual models - Various proprietary and open-source large language models are benchmarked and compared between English and Bengali.

- Education - Broader context of the work is improving capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT for educational applications.

- Performance discrepancy - Key finding is significant gap between model performance on English vs Bengali questions.

- Low-resource language models - Need for better capabilities in languages like Bengali highlighted.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes appending English translations to prompts when asking models to answer questions in Bengali. What are some potential issues with relying on English translation, and how might the quality of translation impact model performance?

2. The paper finds that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps more on reasoning questions compared to factual ones. Why might this be the case? What modifications could be made to CoT prompting to make it more effective on factual questions? 

3. When evaluating the impact of CoT prompting, the paper only checks if the final answer is correct rather than examining the validity of each reasoning step. What are the tradeoffs with this evaluation approach, and how could a more in-depth analysis of the reasoning chains be conducted?

4. The paper relies primarily on the multiple-choice format for questions. How might the findings change if open-ended questions were used instead? What challenges would that introduce?

5. What types of linguistic phenomena in Bengali (e.g. morphology, syntax, semantics) might current models particularly struggle with? How could the dataset and analysis be extended to shed more light on these issues? 

6. The paper identifies terminology and non-Latin scripts as two factors that contribute to poorer Bengali performance. How could these be targeted through specialized preprocessing or fine-tuning approaches?

7. The paper links subject performance to the distribution of question types in each subject. Could further annotations around required skills and knowledge be added to more directly study these relationships?

8. Are there alternative prompt-based techniques beyond CoT and translation appending that could be effective for Bengali? How can the tradeoffs between different prompting methods be analyzed?

9. The English questions contain some grammatical errors. Beyond the small-scale test done, how can the impact of such errors be more conclusively characterized?

10. How suitable is the dataset for studying few-shot learning? Could a more challenging subset be derived to require more complex reasoning even from a small number of examples?
