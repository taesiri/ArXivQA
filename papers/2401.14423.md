# [Prompt Design and Engineering: Introduction and Advanced Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper on prompt design and engineering for generative AI models:

Problem:
Prompt design and engineering has emerged as a critical discipline for building effective generative AI systems based on models like large language models (LLMs). However, crafting optimal prompts requires both an understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations as well as specialized techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive introduction and review of prompt engineering methods.  

Proposed Solution:  
The paper first explains the fundamentals of prompts and provides basic examples like instructions combined with questions or input data. It then delves into advanced prompt engineering techniques including:

- Chain of Thought (CoT) - Guiding the model through explicit reasoning steps 
- Tree of Thought (ToT) - Allowing the model to explore multiple reasoning branches
- Tools, Connectors and Skills - Enabling access to external data sources and specialized functions
- Automatic Multi-step Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)  
- Self-Consistency via ensemble methods
- Reflection for self-assessment of outputs
- Expert Prompting to simulate expert perspectives
- Chains and Rails to control and constrain responses

The paper also covers the integration of external knowledge sources through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and the design of specialized LLM agents. Relevant prompt engineering frameworks and toolkits are summarized.

Main Contributions:
- Provides comprehensive introduction to prompt engineering covering both fundamental and advanced techniques 
- Reviews wide range of strategies for improving LLM performance via tailored prompting
- Explains cutting-edge methods like automated reasoning, reflective prompts and expert prompting
- Discusses integration of tools, knowledge sources and conversational agents
- Outlines real-world frameworks and toolkits enabling implementation

In just a few months, prompt engineering has rapidly advanced to become integral for building robust and capable generative AI systems. This paper offers an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this emerging sub-field.
