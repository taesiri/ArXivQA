# [TransHuman: A Transformer-based Human Representation for Generalizable   Neural Human Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12291)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper template, it does not seem to contain a full research paper. The template only includes placeholders and formatting for various sections like the abstract, introduction, related work, etc. without any actual content filled in. As such, there is no clear research question or hypothesis presented. The template appears intended to provide authors with the proper ICCV paper format rather than presenting a complete study.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This appears to be a LaTeX template for submitting papers to the ICCV conference, rather than a full paper. The main elements I see are:- It is formatted for the ICCV conference using the iccv.sty package.- It defines some convenient LaTeX commands like \ie, \eg, \vs. - It sets up bibliography and referencing using bibtex. - It includes commonly used packages like graphicx, amsmath, hyperref.- It has sections for the abstract, main text, bibliography, appendix.- It numbers the pages and adds headers/footers for a camera ready version.So in summary, this seems to be a template that sets up LaTeX with common commands and sections to make it easier to write and format a paper for submission to the ICCV conference. The main contribution is providing a straightforward template/baseline for the paper format rather than introducing novel research content.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper presents a transformer-based framework (TransHuman) for generalizable neural human rendering, which is an emerging research area aimed at synthesizing novel views of human subjects from sparse input views. - Most prior works in this field have used 3D convolutional networks like SparseConvNet to process a parametric human model (like SMPL) and generate a human representation. This paper argues that transformers can capture global relationships between human body parts better than local 3D convolutions.- The main novelties compared to prior works seem to be: 1) Using transformers on the SMPL model under a canonical pose rather than directly on the observed poses 2) Deforming the canonical representation to the observed pose using deformable partial radiance fields 3) Integrating fine details from image features guided by the human representation.- Experiments show TransHuman significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods like NHP and GP-NeRF on datasets like ZJU-MoCap and Human3.6M for tasks like pose/identity generalization and few-shot novel view synthesis. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the transformer approach.- The method is also shown to be efficient, requiring fewer parameters and less memory than existing methods while achieving better performance. This makes it more practical for real applications.- Overall, the key differentiation is the use of transformers on canonical SMPL rather than 3D convolutions on observed SMPL poses. This is shown to improve generalization ability by learning global relationships in a consistent pose space. The deformable radiance fields and integration of image details also help.In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in generalizable human view synthesis by replacing 3D convolutions with transformers on canonical SMPL models. The experiments demonstrate clear improvements in accuracy and efficiency over existing approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring joint optimization of the fitted SMPL model and neural renderer during training. The current method relies on pre-fitted SMPL models which may not perfectly align with the true body shape and pose. Jointly optimizing the SMPL model could improve accuracy.- Training on unconstrained multi-view capture setups. The current method requires calibrated multi-view input videos. Extending to unconstrained capture could increase practical applicability. - Incorporating semantic and texture guidance, such as from pre-trained vision models, to potentially improve detail synthesis and reduce training data requirements.- Investigating model-based nonlinear neural rendering. The current rendering approach is based on standard volumetric rendering. Exploring more advanced differentiable rendering techniques tailored for humans could be beneficial.- Generalizing beyond humans to other articulated objects. The core ideas could potentially apply to other objects with predictable structure like hands, animals, robots, etc.- Adding dynamics for video-based novel view synthesis. The current method synthesizes single frames. Adding motion modeling could enable video generation.In summary, the main suggestions are around extending the approach to more unconstrained capture, incorporating more semantic guidance, using more advanced rendering techniques, generalizing beyond humans, and adding dynamics/video capabilities. Overall the paper presents a solid foundation and points to many interesting future avenues for development.
