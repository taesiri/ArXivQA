# [Human Curriculum Effects Emerge with In-Context Learning in Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Humans show a "blocking advantage" in category learning when tasks have rule-like structure - learning is better when related trials are blocked together over time rather than interleaved. But in the absence of rules, humans show an "interleaving advantage".
- No existing neural network model reproduces both effects within the same system. This is a challenge for developing flexible models that capture the full range of human learning abilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- Distinguish between "in-context learning" (ICL), which happens in activation dynamics, and "in-weight learning" (IWL), which happens through weight updates.
- Hypothesize that ICL drives the blocking advantage when possible due to rules, while failures in ICL trigger IWL, which shows an interleaving advantage.

Contributions:
- Show that large language models, which use ICL, reproduce the blocking advantage on a compositional generalization task.
- Use metalearning to impart ICL abilities to a smaller neural network, then show it reproduces both the blocking (via successful ICL) and interleaving (when ICL fails, triggering IWL) advantages on the task.
- Propose a novel integrated account of both phenomena based on the interplay between ICL and IWL within a single system.
- Suggest this ICL/IWL distinction could be a general principle underlying flexible human-like learning abilities in neural networks.

In summary, the paper identifies reproducing contrasting human curriculum effects as an important challenge for neural networks, then offers a solution based on interactions between two distinct learning mechanisms, validated in large language models and metalearning. This proposes a new perspective on achieving human-like learning in flexible artificial systems.
