# [Learning from Graphs with Heterophily: Progress and Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Towards Learning from Graphs with Heterophily: Progress and Future":

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on homophilous graphs where connected nodes tend to have the same label. However, they perform poorly on heterophilous graphs where linked nodes tend to have different labels, due to two key constraints: aggregation constraint and local constraint.

- There is a lack of comprehensive review of learning from heterophilous graphs beyond just heterophilous GNNs. Existing surveys focus narrowly on heterophilous GNN architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper provides the first comprehensive review of learning from heterophilous graphs, covering over 180 publications. 

- It introduces a new taxonomy to categorize existing works from three perspectives: learning strategies, model architectures and practical applications.

- For learning strategies, it summarizes works on (semi-)supervised learning, self-supervised learning, model robustness learning, large-scale graph learning and prompt learning.

- For model architectures, it focuses on message passing based methods and graph transformer based methods. 

- For applications, it reviews works on social networks, spatial networks and biochemical networks.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive review of heterophilous graph learning with a broader scope beyond just GNNs

- New taxonomy to systematically categorize existing literature

- Thorough analysis and comparison of different learning strategies and model architectures

- Highlight promising future research directions, including benchmark datasets, model robustness, comprehensive metrics, advanced backbones and integration with large language models.

In summary, this paper provides the most comprehensive review of the emerging field of heterophilous graph learning thus far, analyzed from various perspectives. The structured taxonomy and future outlook offer valuable guidance for advancing this domain.
