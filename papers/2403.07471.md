# [On the nonconvexity of some push-forward constraints and its   consequences in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07471)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Push-forward constraints, where a function redistributes one probability distribution to another, play an important role in machine learning problems like generative modeling and algorithmic fairness. 
- However, the literature lacks an understanding of when such constraints lead to convex optimization problems, which are desirable for statistical and computational reasons. Specifically, it is unclear how the convexity of the set of feasible "transport maps" or "equalizing maps" relates to properties of the input measures.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a theoretical analysis on when the sets of transport maps (that push one measure to another) and equalizing maps (that push two measures to the same output) are convex.
- Show that these sets are typically not convex, which makes it impossible to define convex losses that quantify deviation from these nonconvex constraints.
- Apply this framework to explain fundamental limitations in constructing convex learning problems for generative modeling and algorithmic fairness.

Main Contributions:
- Precise characterization of when the sets of transport maps and equalizing maps are empty, singleton, or not convex between common measures.
- Proof that no convex loss can quantify deviation from a nonconvex constraint, elucidating obstacles in machine learning tasks involving push-forward constraints. 
- Concrete illustrations of how push-forward generative modeling and statistical parity constraints fundamentally suffer from nonconvexity, providing guidance on the (im)possibility of convex formulations.
- Discussion of strategies to recover convexity by strengthening/weakening constraints or using random couplings.

Overall, the paper thoroughly investigates the convexity of push-forward constraints, connects this to limitations in convex learning formulations, and gives direction for recovering convexity. The technical measure-theoretic analysis paired with the machine learning implications make notable contributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proves that pushing forward probability measures through functions is generally a nonconvex operation, with significant consequences for designing convex machine learning optimization problems involving such push-forward constraints, including in generative modeling and algorithmic fairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing a theoretical analysis of the (non)convexity of push-forward constraints and their sets of feasible solutions in machine learning problems. Specifically:

1) It studies the convexity properties of two key sets - the set of transport maps (that redistribute one probability measure to another) and the set of equalizing maps (that transform multiple probability measures into the same output measure). It provides concrete results showing that these sets are generally nonconvex except for some trivial cases.

2) It then discusses the critical implications of the nonconvexity of these push-forward constraints on popular machine learning tasks like generative modeling and algorithmic fairness. Using the framework of constrained and penalized optimization problems, it formally shows how the nonconvexity of the constraints leads to limitations in guaranteeing overall convexity. 

3) Finally, it proposes some directions to recover convexity by either changing the constraint itself or moving to a probabilistic coupling formulation.

In summary, the key contribution is elucidating the nonconvexity issues with push-forward constraints both mathematically and in terms of impact on convexity-requiring machine learning problems. This provides useful guidance to researchers and practitioners working in these areas.

The paper provides an in-depth analysis of push-forward constraints, specifically transport maps and equalizing maps, which play a key role in machine learning problems like generative modeling and algorithmic fairness. It studies the convexity properties of these constraints, and shows that they are generally nonconvex. This has significant implications for designing convex optimization problems involving such constraints in machine learning. The paper discusses the consequences of this nonconvexity, as well as some strategies to potentially recover convexity by changing the constraint or using random couplings instead of deterministic mappings. Overall, it provides important theoretical insights that are very relevant for machine learning research and practice.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes studying the convexity properties of the set of transport maps $\T(P,Q)$ and set of equalizing maps $\E(P,Q)$ between probability measures. What are some of the key motivations for studying the convexity of these sets? How might it impact machine learning problems involving push-forward constraints?

2) Theorem 1 provides a characterization of subsets of functions matching the squared Euclidean norm between two probabilities, showing they are either trivial or nonconvex. What is the intuition behind the proof? Why does matching this single moment imply such strong restrictions on convexity?  

3) Proposition 1 shows that for a continuous source measure $P$, the set $\T(P,Q)$ contains an uncountable number of non-equivalent functions, and hence is nonconvex by Corollary 1. What aspect of continuity enables such an uncountable construction? How does this compare to the finite, empirical case?

4) How do the convexity results for transport maps translate to common statistical scenarios, such as between empirical distributions or absolutely continuous distributions? What practical guidance do Propositions 2 and 3 provide?

5) While transport maps have been widely studied, equalizing maps lack basic characterization. What global insights does Example 1 and Proposition 4 provide on the shape of equalizing constraints? When can convexity occur?

6) Theorem 2 provides intricate necessary and sufficient conditions for the convexity of equalizing maps between discrete measures. What is the intuition behind item (i)? Why does it typically fail to hold except in trivial cases?

7) How do the results on equalizing maps transfer to the empirical setting? What role does coprimality of support sizes play according to Proposition 5? How does Proposition 6 extend this characterization to non-disjoint supports?

8) The paper argues push-forward constraints lead to nonconvexity in generative modeling and algorithmic fairness. Concretely, what convexity challenges arise in these contexts? Are there any scenarios where convex formulations could be obtained?

9) Two approaches are suggested to recover convexity - changing the constraint or changing the model class. What are some examples provided? What are the potential limitations? Are there other directions that could be explored?

10) Beyond the specific technical contributions, what broader impact might clearly understanding the nonconvexity of push-forward operations have on machine learning research and practice? How might this influence problem formulation going forward?
