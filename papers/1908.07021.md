# [A synthetic approach to Markov kernels, conditional independence and   theorems on sufficient statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07021)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central goal of this paper is to develop a general categorical framework for probability theory and statistics. More specifically, the paper introduces the notion of a "Markov category" as an abstract axiomatization of systems of Markov kernels. Markov categories provide a unified setting to express concepts like conditional independence, sufficient statistics, completeness, and minimality in a way that is independent of the specific underlying category representing a probabilistic system. The key innovation is the level of abstraction - by only assuming some high-level categorical properties like symmetric monoidal structure and commutative comonoids, many results and definitions from probability theory and statistics can be derived in a generic way. This provides a conceptual clarity and rigor to these concepts, as well as generality since the framework can be applied in many concrete categories of interest beyond just discrete or measure-theoretic probability.The paper demonstrates this by introducing Markov categories, providing several examples, and developing aspects of probability theory like conditioning, conditional independence, almost sure equality, sufficient statistics, completeness, and minimality abstractly using the Markov category axioms. Overall, the goal is to provide a new, synthetic perspective on the foundations of probability and statistics based on categorical abstraction. The hope is that this will lead to new insights and facilitate the transfer of concepts across different probabilistic settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It develops the theory of "Markov categories" as a framework for synthetic probability theory and statistics. Markov categories axiomatize systems of Markov kernels, allowing key concepts like conditioning, conditional independence, almost sure equality, sufficient statistics, etc to be defined abstractly and studied in a general categorical setting. 2. It demonstrates that many concrete categories of interest are examples of Markov categories, including finite stochastic matrices, measurable spaces with Markov kernels, Gaussian Markov kernels, etc. This allows the abstract definitions and results to be instantiated in these familiar probabilistic settings.3. It proves abstract categorical versions of several core results in probability and statistics, including:- The semigraphoid properties of conditional independence- Existence and properties of conditional products - Versions of the factorization theorems of Fisher-Neyman, Basu, and Bahadur on sufficient statistics4. It develops the notion of "almost sure" equality and determinism in Markov categories, showing these concepts interact well and allow constructing categories of probability spaces internal to any Markov category.5. Overall, it provides a unified perspective on probability and statistics, with definitions and proofs formulated at a higher level of abstraction. This is argued to provide greater generality, conceptual clarity, modularity, and potential for further development of the theory.In summary, the main innovation is the development of Markov categories as a foundation for probability and statistics. By abstracting key concepts, many core results can be proven in great generality, applying across diverse concrete examples. This provides a new categorical perspective on the foundations of probability and statistics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper develops a synthetic approach to Markov kernels, conditional independence, and theorems on sufficient statistics using the framework of Markov categories. Here is a brief comparison to other related research:- It builds on prior work by Golubtsov and Cho & Jacobs on Markov categories, proposing refinements and new results. The key innovation is providing a unified treatment of concepts across many types of probability theory. - It relates to research in categorical probability theory, but takes a more synthetic approach focused on high-level axioms rather than measure theory. The paper cites connections to work by Lawvere, Giry, and others.- There is overlap with computer science approaches to probabilistic reasoning, as the paper notes. It engages particularly with work by Jacobs, Panangaden, Simpson, and Staton on compositionality and conditional independence.- The abstract treatment of statistics relates conceptually to foundational work by Dawid, McCullagh, Lauritzen, and others. The formalization of concepts like sufficient statistics is compared.- The categorical techniques connect to research on probabilistic couplings and graphical models. Conditional independence is compared to notions studied by Studen√Ω, Franz, and Coecke & Spekkens.- The paper aims to unify perspectives across probability, statistics, computer science, and category theory. It contrasts the synthetic approach to more concrete, analytic treatments in parts of the literature.In summary, this paper leverages categorical methods to synthesize concepts from across probability and statistics. It relates closely to prior categorical probability research, while aiming to increase the level of abstraction and generality. The comparisons help clarify the relationships between this and other approaches.
