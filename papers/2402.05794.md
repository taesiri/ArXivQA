# [Phonetically rich corpus construction for a low-resourced language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Speech technologies rely on capturing speaker variability and comprehensive language information in speech datasets. However, existing methods for constructing "phonetically rich" corpora are still insufficient, especially for low-resourced languages like Brazilian Portuguese.  

- Simply increasing the number of distinct triphones or selecting low-probability triphones does not guarantee adequate representation of all possible phonetic combinations.

- There is a need for better methods to develop corpora with broad phonetic coverage for acoustic modeling tasks, especially for low-resourced languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel methodology to create a phonetically rich text corpus for Brazilian Portuguese speech synthesis and modeling. 

- The methodology includes: establishing the phonemic inventory, collecting diverse text datasets, processing the text (cleaning, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, triphone classification), selecting sentences based on triphone distribution to maximize variability.

- They classify triphones into vocoid/contoid units based on acoustic-articulatory features to better represent variability.

- Selection algorithm applied in batches to form an optimal corpus by setting thresholds for triphone types.

Main Contributions:
- Outlines complete methodological pipeline for constructing phonetically rich corpora for low-resourced languages.

- Introduces vocoid/contoid classification of triphones based on acoustic-articulatory motivation to better capture variability. 

- Achieves 55.8% higher distinct triphone percentage over baseline methods.

- Generated corpus has significantly higher phonetic richness compared to existing Portuguese corpora.

- Provides guidelines for speaker selection protocols and high-quality recording methods.

Overall, the paper makes methodological and practical contributions for improving representation of phonetic variability in speech datasets for low-resourced languages.
