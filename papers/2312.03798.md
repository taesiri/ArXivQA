# [Single Image Reflection Removal with Reflection Intensity Prior   Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Single image reflection removal (SIRR) aims to separate the reflection component and recover the transmission component from a single input image captured through a glass window. This is an ill-posed problem due to the unknown degradation functions and lack of prior information. Many existing methods rely too heavily on specific prior assumptions that do not generalize well to real-world images with diverse reflections.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a general reflection intensity prior that captures the strength of the reflection phenomenon in local regions, without relying on any predefined assumptions. 

1) A Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN) is introduced to predict this reflection intensity prior by comparing regular images without reflections (using an ImageNet pre-trained backbone) and images with reflections. RPEN outputs a reflection intensity map indicating the strength of reflections in local patches.

2) A Prior-based Reflection Removal Network (PRRN) is proposed to remove reflections guided by the predicted reflection prior map from RPEN. PRRN uses a simple transformer U-Net architecture with prior embedding and reflection-aware residual blocks.

3) The image is segmented into patches to obtain non-uniform reflection priors that guide region-adaptive reflection removal in PRRN. Smaller patch sizes lead to more accurate priors but are harder to predict. A balance is achieved using 7x7 patches.

4) The models are trained on a variety of real and synthetic datasets to ensure generalization.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a general reflection intensity prior without relying on specific assumptions about the reflection phenomenon

- Introduces a Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN) to predict this reflection prior from images  

- Develops a Prior-based Reflection Removal Network (PRRN) that utilizes the predicted reflection prior for guided reflection removal

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on real-world reflection removal benchmarks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach

In summary, the key novelty is in learning and utilizing a general reflection intensity prior to guide neural networks, instead of using hand-designed priors based on assumptions that do not generalize well. This helps advance the state-of-the-art in single image reflection removal.
