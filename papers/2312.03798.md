# [Single Image Reflection Removal with Reflection Intensity Prior   Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Single image reflection removal (SIRR) aims to separate the reflection component and recover the transmission component from a single input image captured through a glass window. This is an ill-posed problem due to the unknown degradation functions and lack of prior information. Many existing methods rely too heavily on specific prior assumptions that do not generalize well to real-world images with diverse reflections.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a general reflection intensity prior that captures the strength of the reflection phenomenon in local regions, without relying on any predefined assumptions. 

1) A Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN) is introduced to predict this reflection intensity prior by comparing regular images without reflections (using an ImageNet pre-trained backbone) and images with reflections. RPEN outputs a reflection intensity map indicating the strength of reflections in local patches.

2) A Prior-based Reflection Removal Network (PRRN) is proposed to remove reflections guided by the predicted reflection prior map from RPEN. PRRN uses a simple transformer U-Net architecture with prior embedding and reflection-aware residual blocks.

3) The image is segmented into patches to obtain non-uniform reflection priors that guide region-adaptive reflection removal in PRRN. Smaller patch sizes lead to more accurate priors but are harder to predict. A balance is achieved using 7x7 patches.

4) The models are trained on a variety of real and synthetic datasets to ensure generalization.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a general reflection intensity prior without relying on specific assumptions about the reflection phenomenon

- Introduces a Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN) to predict this reflection prior from images  

- Develops a Prior-based Reflection Removal Network (PRRN) that utilizes the predicted reflection prior for guided reflection removal

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on real-world reflection removal benchmarks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach

In summary, the key novelty is in learning and utilizing a general reflection intensity prior to guide neural networks, instead of using hand-designed priors based on assumptions that do not generalize well. This helps advance the state-of-the-art in single image reflection removal.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a reflection removal method that extracts regional reflection intensity priors using a Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN) and removes reflections by feeding the priors into a Transformer U-Net based Prior-based Reflection Removal Network (PRRN).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a general reflection intensity prior that captures the strength of the reflection phenomenon in an image, without relying on any specific prior assumptions about the nature of the reflections. 

2. It introduces a Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN) that learns to estimate this reflection intensity prior in a patch-wise manner for each input image.

3. It proposes a Prior-based Reflection Removal Network (PRRN) that utilizes the estimated reflection intensity prior from RPEN to guide the network to remove reflections adaptively for each region.

4. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on several real-world reflection removal benchmarks, showing its ability to handle diverse reflection phenomena beyond specific prior assumptions made in previous methods.

In summary, the key innovation is in learning and exploiting a general reflection intensity prior, instead of relying on hand-crafted or pre-defined assumptions about reflections, to guide the network to remove reflections more robustly. The proposed RPEN and PRRN framework effectively realizes this idea and sets new state-of-the-art for the task.
