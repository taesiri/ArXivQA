# [Translation Errors Significantly Impact Low-Resource Languages in   Cross-Lingual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02080)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Popular cross-lingual benchmarks like XNLI use human translations of English data into multiple languages as test sets. However, there are concerns on whether these translations consistently preserve semantic relationships from the original English data, especially for low-resource languages.

- This paper finds that translation inconsistencies leading to label errors do exist in XNLI's human translations, and they disproportionately impact low-resource languages like Hindi, Urdu and Swahili. 

Methodology:
- Compare XNLI performance of models on human translations versus machine translations of original English data. Larger gaps indicate translation errors that alter semantics.

- Human evaluation by re-annotating subset of XNLI sentences in Hindi/Urdu to check agreement with original English labels. 

- Attention analysis to compare overlap in attention heads between English sentences and corresponding human/machine translated sentences.

Key Findings:
- XNLI performance gaps between human and machine translations were much higher for low-resource languages, suggesting label inconsistencies.

- In human evaluation, newly annotated Hindi/Urdu labels only matched original English labels 60-66% of the time, a big drop from 90% for English.

- Attention overlap was higher between English sentences and their machine translations compared to human translations.

Main Contributions:
- Highlighted problem of translation errors in XNLI disproportionately impacting low-resource languages, proposed method to identify them.

- Showed these errors persist in multiple train/test settings.

- Human evaluation and attention analysis provided further evidence on inadequacies of human translations for languages like Hindi and Urdu.

Overall, the paper makes a strong case for acquiring high-quality translations and ensuring label consistency for low-resource languages in cross-lingual datasets.
