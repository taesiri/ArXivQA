# [Assessing the influence of attractor-verb distance on grammatical   agreement in humans and language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16978)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates subject-verb agreement in the presence of an attractor noun located between the main noun and verb, parametrically manipulating the distance between the attractor and verb while keeping sentence length equal. Both human participants (n=34) and neural language models (GPT-3 and T5 transformers) made more agreement errors when the attractor was closer to the verb, but the models performed near chance levels for proximal attractors while humans were largely able to overcome the interference. The authors hypothesize the proximity effect results from calculating transition probabilities between adjacent words, supporting linear rather than structural language processing. However, the asymmetry between congruent and incongruent sentences suggests the cue-based retrieval model of agreement attraction may also contribute. Though both humans and models showed sensitivity to attractor distance, humans were less affected by local statistical regularities. The findings reveal similarities and differences in linguistic processing between humans and state-of-the-art neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how the distance between an attractor noun and a verb affects grammatical agreement processing in humans and neural language models, finding that both make more mistakes when the attractor is closer to the verb, but humans are largely able to overcome the interference while neural networks approach chance levels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper introduces a parametric manipulation of the distance between the attractor noun and the verb in subject-verb agreement sentences. By comparing human judgments and neural language model performances across different attractor distances (proximal vs distal), the paper aims to disentangle structural vs linear effects in language processing. The key findings are:

- Both humans and NLMs make more mistakes when the attractor is closer to the verb, suggesting an effect of attractor distance. However, humans are mostly able to overcome the interference while NLMs approach chance level.

- There is a linear effect of attractor distance on human reaction times. 

- Humans show an asymmetry between congruent and incongruent sentences that is not observed in NLMs. Specifically, congruent sentences facilitate human judgment of ungrammatical cases when the attractor is proximal.

- The authors hypothesize that the proximity effect may be explained by transition probabilities between adjacent words. However, other explanations like the cue-based retrieval model cannot be ruled out.

In summary, the paper introduces a new experimental manipulation to separate structural and linear effects, reveals differences between human and NLM language processing, and points to transition probabilities as a potential factor influencing subject-verb agreement.

The paper examines how the distance between an attractor noun and the verb affects grammatical agreement judgments in humans and neural language models. It introduces a parametric manipulation of this distance and compares the error rates and reaction times. Key findings include greater interference when the attractor noun is closer to the verb, differences in how congruency affects humans vs. NLMs, the role of transitional probabilities, and contrasts between structural and linear processing. The terminology covers both the experimental design concepts as well as the theoretical linguistic concepts relevant to analyzing subject-verb agreement and modeling language processing.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a parametric manipulation of the distance between the attractor noun and the verb. What is the rationale behind this manipulation and what does it allow the authors to test? How is this different from previous studies on subject-verb agreement?

2. The paper contrasts structural and linear accounts of language processing. Can you explain in more detail what is meant by "structural" and "linear" processing and how the experimental design aims to dissociate the two? 

3. The paper hypothesizes that the proximity effect observed may be explained by the calculation of transition probabilities between adjacent words. Can you elaborate on what transition probabilities are and how they could explain the observed effects? 

4. The cue-based retrieval model is discussed as an alternative explanation for the results. Can you summarize how this model accounts for attraction effects in subject-verb agreement? Why might it also explain the distance manipulation introduced here?

5. The design includes a baseline condition with matched sentence length but no attractor noun. What is the purpose of including this baseline condition? How does it help attribute different effects to the overall error rate?

6. Both congruency and violation effects are analyzed. What does congruency refer to and what does the violation effect capture? Why are both effects relevant to test the accounts of language processing?  

7. What is meant by the "markedness" phenomenon discussed in the results section? Why would markedness lead to asymmetrical attraction effects for singular versus plural attractors?

8. The paper observes different sensitivity to the attractor distance in humans versus language models. What specific differences are noted and what might explain them in terms of how each system processes language?

9. What are some limitations of the study design and results that the authors acknowledge? How could future work address these limitations? 

10. The paper hypothesizes a role for transition probabilities in language processing for both humans and language models. What future experiments could further test this hypothesis? What predictions would it make?
