# [LoCoDL: Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning with Local Training   and Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04348)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of communication-efficient distributed optimization, where multiple clients collaboratively minimize the sum of their individual cost functions by communicating with a central server. Communication is the main bottleneck in such systems. The paper focuses specifically on combining two popular techniques to reduce communication: local training (clients perform multiple local update steps between rounds of communication) and compression (clients send compressed model updates instead of full vectors). Developing algorithms that can effectively combine both techniques for linear convergence is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new algorithm called LoCoDL that successfully combines local training and compression. LoCoDL is a primal-dual method where each client maintains two model estimates - a local estimate and a global estimate that is synchronized across clients. Clients perform local training by taking multiple gradient steps on their local estimate. For compression, clients compress the difference between their local estimate and the global estimate, avoiding compression error amplification over iterations. LoCoDL allows generic unbiased compressors satisfying certain variance bounds. It features a randomized local training mechanism where communication happens randomly with some probability after each iteration.

Main Contributions:
- LoCoDL provably combines the benefits of local training and compression, achieving doubly accelerated communication complexity with respect to condition number and model dimension. This matches the best known theoretical complexity.
- Convergence and complexity analysis of LoCoDL under standard assumptions. LoCoDL converges linearly to the exact optimizer.
- LoCoDL allows a wide range of practical unbiased compressors like sparsification and quantization, unlike some prior arts requiring complex custom compressors.
- Experiments demonstrate LoCoDL outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms combining compression and local training, sometimes even those with better complexity. This shows the advantage of LoCoDL's specific algorithmic design.

Overall, the paper makes important contributions in developing communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithms by effectively combining both local training and compression. LoCoDL advances the state-of-the-art in theory and practice.
