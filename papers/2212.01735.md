## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we design an efficient neural field framework that decomposes a signal jointly in both the spatial and frequency domains, inspired by wavelets?

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel framework for neural fields that performs spatial and frequency decomposition jointly, inspired by wavelets and filter banks. 

- Using a multi-scale grid structure for spatial decomposition, but linking grids to frequencies by encoding grid features with Fourier features before using them.

- Composing the final signal estimate through an MLP architecture that accumulates features from different frequency bands sequentially.

- Demonstrating improved efficiency and accuracy trade-offs compared to prior work on 2D image fitting, 3D shape reconstruction, and novel view synthesis with NeRF.

So in summary, the main research question is about designing a neural field framework that effectively considers both space and frequency jointly for decomposition, in order to achieve better quality and efficiency. The wavelet-inspired design and the use of Fourier features with grid encoding seem to be key to their approach and contributions.
