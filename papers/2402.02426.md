# [Hybrid-Prediction Integrated Planning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous driving systems require advanced capabilities in perception, prediction, and planning to navigate complex real-world scenarios. However, recent research has shown that simply improving these modules independently has limited benefits. There is a need to integrate prediction and planning to achieve concurrent advancements. Prior works have explored integrated pipelines by connecting planning with either motion predictions (IPP) or occupancy predictions (IOP). However, relying solely on one prediction format has drawbacks - motion predictions lack consistency while occupancy predictions lose agent-wise details. This highlights the complementarity between the two that needs to be exploited. Simply integrating them also introduces challenges around inherent trade-offs, discrepancies between prediction patterns, and lack of interactive co-design for social coherence.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Hybrid-Prediction integrated Planning (HPP) system to address the above challenges. HPP concurrently integrates motion and occupancy predictions with planning in a co-design process to ensure consistent and complementary guidance. It has three key components:

1) MS-OccFormer: Predicts occupancy probabilities conditioned on motion predictions to align joint patterns with marginal agent details. Uses multi-scale Transformer decoders for interactive refinement across time horizons and spatial granularity.

2) GTFormer: Models future interactive behaviors between agents via game-theoretic reasoning conditioned on joint occupancy. Enables flexible reasoning specific to planning objectives.  

3) Ego Planner: Plans trajectories interacting with outputs from GTFormer and MS-OccFormer. Models fine-grained hybrid prediction interactions and refines planning for compatibility and safety.

Overall, HPP concurrently optimizes the complementary hybrid predictions to guide planning through a collaborative learning framework. It channels interactions via Transformer queries and establishes planning-oriented refinement.

Contributions:
- A modular co-design approach to integrate complementary occupancy and motion predictions with planning in a consistent and interactive manner.

- Innovative architectures for conditional occupancy prediction, game-theoretic reasoning, and planning that enable flexible hybrid prediction-guided optimizations.

- State-of-the-art performance on multiple autonomous driving benchmarks like nuScenes and Waymo, with consistent superiority in prediction accuracy, planning errors, and driving metrics. 

- Extensive analysis of modular roles and prediction characteristics that provides directions for future integrated system designs.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing integrated prediction-planning paradigms through a novel framework guided by flexible hybrid predictions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modular co-design optimization framework called Hybrid-Prediction Integrated Planning (HPP) for autonomous driving systems, which integrates multi-agent motion and occupancy predictions to enhance the consistency, accuracy and safety of the planning module.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing HPP, a modular co-design optimization framework for autonomous driving systems that integrates hybrid prediction and planning. Specifically, it introduces:

1) MS-OccFormer module to perform marginal-conditioned joint occupancy prediction that aligns consistently with marginal motion prediction. 

2) GTFormer module to model the interactive future among individual agents with their joint predictive awareness through game-theoretic reasoning. 

3) Hybrid prediction-aware Ego Planner that concurrently models interactions of integrated hybrid prediction patterns and optimizes planning with hybrid prediction guidance.

Through extensive evaluations, HPP demonstrates superior accuracy, consistency, and safety in both prediction and planning tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. The key innovation is the hybrid prediction integration and optimization in a modular co-design process to enhance the adaptability and robustness of autonomous driving systems.
