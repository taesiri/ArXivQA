# [Efficient Solvers for Partial Gromov-Wasserstein](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03664)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Efficient Solvers for Partial Gromov-Wasserstein":

Problem:
The paper focuses on developing efficient solvers for the partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem. The PGW problem extends the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric to enable comparing non-probability measures with unequal total mass residing in potentially distinct metric spaces. This allows for unbalanced and partial matching across spaces. Efficient PGW solvers can benefit applications like shape matching, domain adaptation, and representation learning.

Proposed Solution: 
The key insight is that the PGW problem can be transformed into a variant of the GW problem, analogous to how the partial optimal transport (POT) problem is converted into an optimal transport (OT) problem. Leveraging this insight, the paper introduces two Frank-Wolfe algorithm based solvers for the discrete PGW problem. It shows these solvers are mathematically and computationally equivalent, differing from prior PGW solvers.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates PGW problem can be transformed into a GW variant, enabling PGW solutions via OT techniques  
- Proposes two equivalent Frank-Wolfe PGW solvers, establishing their optimality conditions
- Shows PGW constitutes a metric for comparing metric measure spaces
- Analyzes linear convergence of proposed solvers to a stationary point 
- Validates effectiveness of solvers on shape matching and positive-unlabeled learning tasks, comparing to baselines

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in formulating an efficient Frank-Wolfe approach to solve the PGW problem, with theoretical and empirical validation, advancing research on comparing distributions with partial and unbalanced support.

The paper proposes efficient Frank-Wolfe algorithm-based solvers for the partial Gromov-Wasserstein problem to compare probability measures with unequal masses across potentially distinct metric spaces, establishes metric properties, and demonstrates performance on shape matching and positive-unlabeled learning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A proposition showing that the partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem can be transformed into a variant of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem, analogous to how the partial optimal transport (POT) problem is converted into an optimal transport (OT) problem. 

2. Propositions demonstrating that $(PGW_{\lambda,q}(\cdot,\cdot))^{1/p}$ defines a metric between metric measure spaces and that $\lambda$ provides an upper bound on the allowed "transportation" cost.

3. Two new solvers for the discrete PGW problem based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The solvers are shown to be mathematically and computationally equivalent.

4. A convergence analysis proving that, similar to previous Frank-Wolfe solvers for GW, the proposed algorithms converge linearly to a stationary point.

5. Numerical experiments on shape matching and positive-unlabeled learning demonstrating improved performance of the proposed PGW solvers over baselines in terms of computation time and accuracy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) How does the proposed transformation of the partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem into a Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant compare to the transformation of the partial optimal transport (POT) problem into a standard optimal transport (OT) problem? What theoretical connections can be made between these transformations?

2) The paper shows that the proposed PGW problem yields a metric between metric measure spaces. What are the key properties that enable this result? How does this metric compare to other GW-based metrics? 

3) The paper introduces two Frank-Wolfe algorithm variants for solving the PGW problem. What are the key differences and similarities between these two algorithms, both mathematically and computationally? Under what conditions would one variant be preferred over the other?

4) How do the proposed PGW solvers relate to prior solvers for GW and PGW problems? What modifications were made to adapt the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm to the PGW setting?

5) The convergence analysis leverages existing results on Frank-Wolfe algorithms for non-convex problems. What assumptions are needed for the linear convergence rate? Could the analysis be improved under alternative assumptions?  

6) In the shape matching experiment, what enables the partial matching demonstrated by PGW but not GW? How do the correspondences compare between PGW and other partial methods qualitatively?

7) For the positive-unlabeled learning task, how is the prior knowledge of Ï€ incorporated differently in the various GW methods tested? How does this relate to their relative performance?

8) Across experiments, what are the key differences observed between the primal PGW and proposed Lagrangian PGW formulations? When would one be preferred over the other?

9) The computed GW tensor relies on the form of the loss function through Proposition 1. How does the efficiency gain from Proposition 1 compare for different choices of loss functions?

10) What opportunities exist for extending the PGW framework and solvers to other applications where partial matching is needed, such as domain adaptation or learning on graphs? What methodological adaptations would be required?
