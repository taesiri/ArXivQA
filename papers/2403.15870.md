## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "iA$^*$: Imperative Learning-based A$^*$ Search for Pathfinding":

Problem:
Classic search-based pathfinding methods like A* guarantee optimal solutions but scale poorly to large environments. Learning-based methods are more efficient but require lots of labeled data, lack interpretability, and have no optimality guarantees. There is a need for a method that combines the strengths of classic and learned approaches.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel imperative learning-based pathfinding framework called iA* that uses a bilevel optimization strategy. The upper level has a learned model that narrows down the search space to improve efficiency. The lower level contains a differentiable A* module that finds the optimal path given the narrowed search space.

The instance encoder in the upper level is a fully convolutional network that takes in maps with start/goal positions and outputs an initial heuristic guess for A*. The differentiable A* module in the lower level is based on formulating all the A* components like open list, closed list etc. as matrices and uses matrix operations for node selection, expansion and value updates. It finds the optimal path given the instance encoder's outputs.

The framework is trained without any supervision by randomly generating start and goal positions and using the path length and number of nodes explored by the lower level A* as the optimization target for the instance encoder. This allows the method to be applied to new environments without any data labeling.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel imperative learning framework iA* that combines strengths of learned and search-based approaches for efficient, near-optimal pathfinding
- Uses a bilevel optimization strategy and trains the framework in a self-supervised manner, avoiding extensive manual data labeling
- Modifies the differentiable A* algorithm to guarantee optimal solutions
- Achieves faster search and near-optimal paths in public datasets and simulation environments, outperforming prior classical and learned techniques
