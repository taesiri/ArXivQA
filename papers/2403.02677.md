# [Finetuned Multimodal Language Models Are High-Quality Image-Text Data   Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large-scale image-text datasets crawled from the web are critical for pre-training powerful vision-language models (VLMs), but they often contain noisy, mismatched, or low-quality image-text pairs which limit model performance. 
- The predominant filtering approach, CLIPScore, has limitations in capturing fine-grained object-level alignments and handling long text captions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel framework to filter image-text data by fine-tuning Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) as high-quality data filters.
- Design 4 metrics to measure image-text quality from different perspectives: Image-Text Matching, Object Detail Fulfillment, Caption Text Quality, Semantic Understanding.
- Construct a pipeline to generate high-quality instruction data from proprietary models to fine-tune MLMs to accurately assess the 4 quality metrics.
- Apply the fine-tuned MLM filter to score and filter billions of image-text pairs, creating high-quality datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Propose MLM Filter that outperforms CLIPScore via recent MLM advances, usable as a drop-in replacement.
- Pipeline to construct high-quality instruction data to teach MLMs accurate quality assessment.  
- 4 diverse metrics to holistically measure image-text quality from different aspects.
- MLM filtered data leads to significant VLM performance boosts over CLIPScore, eg. +1.7% on 38 DataComp tasks.
- MLM Filter generalizable across models (CLIP, BLIP2) and human-aligned scores.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective framework to leverage fine-tuned MLMs to filter higher quality image-text data, outperforming predominant techniques like CLIPScore. The MLM Filter is model-agnostic and demonstrates improved performance on downstream VLMs.
