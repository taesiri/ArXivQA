## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large-scale image-text datasets crawled from the web are critical for pre-training powerful vision-language models (VLMs), but they often contain noisy, mismatched, or low-quality image-text pairs which limit model performance. 
- The predominant filtering approach, CLIPScore, has limitations in capturing fine-grained object-level alignments and handling long text captions.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel framework to filter image-text data by fine-tuning Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) as high-quality data filters.
- Design 4 metrics to measure image-text quality from different perspectives: Image-Text Matching, Object Detail Fulfillment, Caption Text Quality, Semantic Understanding.
- Construct a pipeline to generate high-quality instruction data from proprietary models to fine-tune MLMs to accurately assess the 4 quality metrics.
- Apply the fine-tuned MLM filter to score and filter billions of image-text pairs, creating high-quality datasets.

Main Contributions:
- Propose MLM Filter that outperforms CLIPScore via recent MLM advances, usable as a drop-in replacement.
- Pipeline to construct high-quality instruction data to teach MLMs accurate quality assessment.  
- 4 diverse metrics to holistically measure image-text quality from different aspects.
- MLM filtered data leads to significant VLM performance boosts over CLIPScore, eg. +1.7% on 38 DataComp tasks.
- MLM Filter generalizable across models (CLIP, BLIP2) and human-aligned scores.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective framework to leverage fine-tuned MLMs to filter higher quality image-text data, outperforming predominant techniques like CLIPScore. The MLM Filter is model-agnostic and demonstrates improved performance on downstream VLMs.

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel framework for filtering image-text data by leveraging fine-tuned Multimodal Language Models (MLMs). 

2. It designs four distinct yet complementary metrics to holistically measure the quality of image-text data from different perspectives: Image-Text Matching, Object Detail Fulfillment, Caption Text Quality, and Semantic Understanding.

3. It establishes a new pipeline to construct high-quality instruction data for fine-tuning MLMs as data filters. 

4. It shows that comparing with CLIPScore, the proposed MLM filters produce more precise and comprehensive scores that directly improve the quality of filtered data and boost the performance of pre-trained models.

5. It demonstrates significant improvements over CLIPScore on popular foundation models (CLIP and BLIP2) and various downstream tasks using the MLM filtered data.

In summary, the key contribution is leveraging fine-tuned MLMs as effective data filters, which outperform predominant filtering methods like CLIPScore. The proposed MLM filter can generalize to different models and tasks, and serves as a drop-in replacement for CLIPScore.
