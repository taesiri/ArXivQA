# [Defining Expertise: Applications to Treatment Effect Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00694)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In treatment effect estimation, the standard assumption made about a decision-maker's policy is that of overlap - that all treatments have a non-zero probability of being assigned to any individual. However, decision-makers are often experts of their domain who take informed actions based on factors that influence outcomes. This results in confounding biases when estimating treatment effects from observational data. Surprisingly, the expertise of decision-makers is seldom formalized as an assumption or leveraged methodologically beyond just assuming overlap. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper argues that explicitly encoding the intuition that decision-makers tend to be domain experts can act as an inductive bias when estimating treatment effects. The authors formally define two types of expertise - prognostic and predictive. Prognostic expertise refers to actions being based on potential outcomes in general, while predictive expertise refers to actions being specifically based on the treatment effect. The paper shows theoretically and empirically that:

1. High expertise leads to greater covariate shift and poorer overlap. This makes encoding expertise as an inductive bias even more critical as estimating treatment effects becomes more challenging.

2. The type and amount of expertise in a dataset significantly influences the performance of different treatment effect estimation methods. Methods that learn balancing representations perform better under purely prognostic expertise, while methods that learn action-predictive representations perform better under predictive expertise.

3. It is possible to estimate the type and amount of expertise likely present in a dataset. This allows selecting the most suitable method for that dataset in a data-driven manner.

Main Contributions:
- Formal definitions of prognostic and predictive expertise
- Theoretical analysis showing high expertise implies poor overlap 
- Empirical analysis demonstrating the performance impact of expertise
- Proposed method to estimate expertise in data and inform model selection

Overall, this paper introduces expertise as a novel and relevant inductive bias for treatment effect estimation, and provides both theory and experiments supporting its utility. Defining, estimating and encoding expertise can lead to better performing and more reliable treatment effect estimates.
