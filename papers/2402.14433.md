# [A Language Model's Guide Through Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14433)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Concept guidance has emerged as a way to control language models by probing hidden representations for concept vectors and using them to influence generation. But most prior work has focused only on the concept of truthfulness. 
- It's unclear how well concept guidance frameworks perform on other concepts like appropriateness, humor, creativity, etc. and whether techniques that work for truthfulness transfer.

Proposed Solution:
- Expand set of target concepts to humor, creativity, quality, and a new concept they term appropriateness. Appropriateness means complying with non-toxic requests and refusing toxic ones.
- Gather datasets labeled for these concepts. Use extreme examples from OpenAssistant datasets. Also create a new appropriateness dataset.
- Systematically compare different probing techniques (logistic regression, PCA, difference in means) and configurations on both detection and guidance for these concepts.  
- Propose a new metric that captures success of concept elicitation and degradation in fluency.

Key Results:
- Truthfulness is most easily guidable, corroborating prior work. Humor and creativity can work with tuning. 
- Appropriateness remains impossible to elicit and instead controls compliance. Reveals concept confusion issues.
- Better detection accuracy does not imply better guidance, contradicting observations on truthfulness.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic analysis across diverse concepts with unified framework
- Evidence that what works for truthfulness does not transfer simply
- Revealing concept elicitability and confusion issues with appropriateness
- New combined metric for assessing guidance success 
- Showing detection strength is not enough for guidance

The paper helps expand concept guidance research to more concepts through thorough benchmarking. It reveals open problems around elicitability and transferability that warrant further investigation in order to make concept guidance frameworks robust.
