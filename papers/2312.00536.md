# [Trained MT Metrics Learn to Cope with Machine-translated References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00536)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates how machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics behave when provided with machine-translated references instead of human references. The authors first show that non-trained metrics like BLEU and chrF exhibit a substantial drop in correlation with human judgments when using machine-translated references. In contrast, trained metrics like COMET maintain most of their accuracy. To further analyze this, the authors fine-tune the Prism metric on human judgments of MT output, using a bidirectional pairwise ranking approach. As expected, fine-tuning significantly improves Prism's correlation with human judgments of unseen test data. Crucially, it also makes Prism more robust to machine-translated references compared to the non-fine-tuned version. This indicates that training a metric on human evaluations allows it to better cope with imperfect, machine-translated references. The key conclusions are: 1) Machine-translated references diminish the accuracy of non-trained reference-based metrics, 2) Trained metrics are more robust to such references, 3) Fine-tuning a metric like Prism on human judgments improves overall accuracy while also increasing robustness to machine-translated references. The findings suggest that training can help metrics make the most of noisy references commonly found in practice.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper shows that metrics trained on human judgments become more robust to machine-translated references, maintaining performance compared to untrained metrics which exhibit substantial declines, indicating trained metrics learn to cope with such references.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a metric evaluation setup that intentionally uses machine-translated references to test the robustness of metrics. The paper shows that non-trained metrics like BLEU and chrF perform much worse on machine-translated references, while trained metrics are more robust.

2) It presents an approach to fine-tune the Prism evaluation metric on human judgments using a bidirectional pairwise ranking objective. Fine-tuning significantly improves Prism's correlation with human judgments on unseen test data.

3) It demonstrates that fine-tuning Prism not only improves its overall accuracy, but also makes it more robust to machine-translated references. This indicates that training a metric on human evaluations influences its behavior beyond just improving correlation.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that trained metrics become more robust to noisy machine-translated references through metric training on human judgments. This addresses an important issue in reference-based MT evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics
- Trained vs non-trained metrics 
- Machine-translated references
- Robustness to noise in references
- Prism metric
- Fine-tuning Prism on human judgments
- Segment-level correlation
- Pairwise ranking loss
- Cross-entropy loss
- Translationese
- Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM)

The paper examines how trained neural MT evaluation metrics like Prism perform better than non-trained metrics like BLEU and chrF when provided with machine-translated references instead of human references. It shows that fine-tuning Prism on human judgments makes it more robust to such noisy references. The key metrics used to evaluate this are segment-level correlation and pairwise system-level accuracy with respect to human judgments. The training uses a combination of cross-entropy and pairwise ranking losses. The paper also connects this to the concept of translationese and using post-edited references.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes fine-tuning Prism using a combination of cross-entropy loss and bidirectional pairwise ranking loss. What is the motivation behind using this particular combination of losses? How do the different loss terms complement each other?

2. The fine-tuning improves Prism's robustness to machine-translated references. What properties do you think the fine-tuning process imparts that leads to this improved robustness? 

3. The paper shows positive transfer of fine-tuning to unseen language pairs like English-Russian. What factors do you think enable this cross-lingual transfer? How can the transfer be further improved?

4. The paper uses error-free system outputs as a simulation of post-edited references. Do you think this adequately approximates real post-edited references? What are some ways the simulation could be further enhanced? 

5. For the pairwise ranking loss, the paper uses an intra-annotator pairing approach to generate training pairs. What is the rationale behind this? What are other viable approaches for generating ranked pairs from MQM annotations?

6. How does the choice of $N$-gram order in metrics like BLEU interact with the quality of references? Would you expect higher-order $N$-gram matches to be more susceptible to noise from machine-translated references?

7. The paper shows COMET is also robust to machine-translated references. What similarities and differences are there between COMET and fine-tuned Prism that might explain their robustness? 

8. The metrics are evaluated on WMT datasets covering two domains - news and TED talks. Do you expect the trends to generalize to other domains like social media text, product reviews etc.? Why or why not?

9. For training data, would it be better to intentionally generate flawed machine-translated references rather than using error-free outputs? What are the pros and cons?

10. The paper focuses on evaluating metrics' correlation to human judgments. Should metric robustness to different reference types be an evaluation criteria by itself, separate from human correlation? Why or why not?
