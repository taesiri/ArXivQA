# [Cross-Attention Makes Inference Cumbersome in Text-to-Image Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Cross-attention is widely used in text-to-image diffusion models to align text and image modalities, but it has quadratic computational complexity which causes expensive latency, especially for high-resolution generation. 
- The role of cross-attention during the inference process has not been studied. It is unclear if cross-attention is equally crucial at all steps.

Key Findings:  
- Empirical analysis shows that the cross-attention map converges after the first few steps during inference. This divides the process into a semantics-planning stage and a subsequent fidelity-improving stage.
- Cross-attention is vital in the initial semantics-planning stage to plan text-oriented visual semantics. However, it becomes redundant in the fidelity-improving stage for enhancing image quality.
- Removing cross-attention in the fidelity-improving stage not only reduces computations but can also slightly improve FID scores.

Proposed Method (Tgate):
- Cache the converged cross-attention outputs after the semantics-planning stage. 
- Reuse the cached outputs during the fidelity-improving stage by bypassing cross-attention computations.
- Eliminates over 50% latency in SDXL model without performance drop or training costs.

Key Contributions:
- Provides temporal analysis and empirical evidence on the functionality of cross-attention during diffusion inference.
- Proposes a simple yet effective method Tgate to accelerate inference by caching and reusing converged cross-attention maps without retraining.
- Achieves significant speedup and computes reduction for various model architectures while maintaining or slightly improving generation quality.
