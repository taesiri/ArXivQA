# [An Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning Based on Multiple Resource   Exchange](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08096)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a collaborative computing framework for federated learning to address the uneven resource allocation among clients. It introduces two types of users - model owners (MOs) with abundant computing resources but lacking data, and data owners (DOs) with local data but limited computing capability. The MO incentivizes more DOs to participate in federated learning by allowing DOs to offload part of their computing tasks to the MO in exchange for their local data contributions. The interactions are formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the overall training time by effectively utilizing communication and computing resources under constraints. A mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is decomposed and solved iteratively in two steps - client selection and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the framework achieves high accuracy in federated learning while significantly reducing the training time compared to benchmark schemes. The key novelty is formulating resource exchange between MO and DOs to motivate participation without monetary rewards.
