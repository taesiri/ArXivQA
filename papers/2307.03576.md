# [One Step of Gradient Descent is Provably the Optimal In-Context Learner   with One Layer of Linear Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03576)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper theoretically studies transformers with one linear self-attention layer trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data. The main research questions are:1. What algorithm does a one-layer transformer with linear self-attention learn to implement when trained on linear regression data, where the covariates are sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution?2. How does changing the distribution of the covariates affect the algorithm learned by the transformer? 3. How does having a nonlinear target function, instead of a linear target function, affect the algorithm learned by the transformer?The central hypotheses tested are:1. When the covariates are isotropic Gaussians, the global minimum of the pre-training loss corresponds to the transformer implementing one step of gradient descent on a linear least squares objective.2. When the covariates have a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution, the global minimum corresponds to one step of preconditioned gradient descent, where the preconditioner depends on the covariance of the covariates.3. Even when the target function is nonlinear, if it satisfies certain assumptions, the global minimum still corresponds to one step of gradient descent on a linear least squares objective. The main theoretical contribution is rigorously proving these hypotheses. The paper shows that the global minimum of the pre-training loss corresponds to an interpretable algorithm even in simple one-layer architectures, complementing prior empirical observations. The results also suggest the distribution of the covariates has a bigger effect on the learned algorithm compared to the response distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper theoretically analyzes the behavior of transformers with one layer of linear self-attention trained on synthetic noisy linear regression tasks. The main contributions are:1. It proves that when the covariates are drawn from an isotropic Gaussian distribution, the global minimizer of the pre-training loss corresponds to a transformer implementing one step of gradient descent on a least squares linear regression objective. This confirms the empirical finding of von Oswald et al. (2022). 2. It shows that when the covariates are drawn from a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution, the global minimizer corresponds to one step of preconditioned gradient descent, where the preconditioner depends on the covariance.3. It proves that even when the response variable is generated from a nonlinear function of the covariates (satisfying some mild assumptions), the global minimizer still corresponds to one step of gradient descent on a linear regression objective. This suggests the distribution of responses does not affect the learned algorithm as much as the distribution of covariates.Overall, the paper provides theoretical justification for empirically observed behavior of simple transformers trained on synthetic regression tasks. It formally shows these transformers learn to implement gradient-based algorithms, and the specific algorithm depends on properties of the data distribution, especially the distribution of covariates.
