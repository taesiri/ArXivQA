# [An Adaptive Model Ensemble Adversarial Attack for Boosting Adversarial   Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02897)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:

How can we improve the transferability of adversarial examples generated from an ensemble of models with diverse architectures (like CNNs and ViTs)? 

The key hypothesis is that by adaptively controlling the fusion of outputs from each model in the ensemble, based on monitoring their contributions to the overall adversarial objective, they can better capture and amplify the intrinsic transferable adversarial information to boost attack transferability.

To summarize, the main goal of this paper is to develop an effective ensemble attack method that can improve the transferability of adversarial examples across models with diverse architectures like CNNs and ViTs. The core ideas are using adaptive gradient modulation and disparity reduction techniques to better exploit the outputs of each model in the ensemble when crafting the adversarial examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an adaptive model ensemble adversarial attack method called AdaEA to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. 

2. The AdaEA adaptively controls the fusion of outputs from each surrogate model by monitoring their contribution discrepancy to the overall adversarial objective. This is done through the proposed adaptive gradient modulation (AGM) strategy.

3. It introduces a disparity-reduced filter (DRF) to further synchronize the update direction by reducing the variance between surrogate models. 

4. Experiments show that AdaEA can consistently outperform existing ensemble attacks and boost existing transfer-based attacks across diverse datasets. The results demonstrate the efficacy of AdaEA in capturing intrinsic transferable adversarial information.

In summary, the key novelty and contribution is the proposed AdaEA method that can effectively improve adversarial transferability by adaptively ensembling surrogate models and reducing their variance. The AGM and DRF strategies enable AdaEA to amplify transferable adversarial information and synchronize update directions. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and versatility of AdaEA.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of adversarial attacks:

- The focus on improving transferability of adversarial examples across diverse models like CNNs and ViTs is novel. Most prior work has focused on transferability within similar models (e.g. CNN to CNN) or gradient masking for robustness. Exploring transferability across very different architectures is an interesting new direction.

- The approach of adaptively modulating and filtering model gradients during ensemble is a unique technique not explored by other ensemble attack methods. Existing approaches like Ensemble Adversarial Training tend to simply average or maximize logits/losses. The analysis around amplifying adversarial information is a valuable contribution.

- The experiments are thorough, testing against 18 different model architectures across 3 datasets. Most prior work evaluated on fewer models or datasets. The inclusion of advanced defense methods and ablation studies further strengthens the empirical results.

- Compared to other state-of-the-art attack methods like MI-FGSM and DI2-FGSM, this paper offers complementary benefits as an ensemble method. The comparisons show it consistently improves transferability when combined with those attacks.

- The efficiency analysis is useful context, showing the adaptive ensemble does add computational cost compared to naive ensemble, but offers better performance trade-off than alternatives like SVRE.

Overall, this paper pushes research forward in a new direction of cross-architecture transferability, proposes adaptive ensemble techniques not explored before, and provides extensive experiments to demonstrate effectiveness. The results advance the understanding of ensemble attacks and transferability of adversarial examples.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the transferability of adversarial examples across wider gaps between surrogate and target models. The authors mention that their approach shows good transferability between CNNs and ViTs, but transferring across even more fundamentally different model architectures remains an open challenge.

- Exploring adaptive ensemble methods for other adversarial attack scenarios like evasion, poisoning, etc. The adaptive ensemble approach proposed could potentially be extended to improve other types of adversarial attacks. 

- Analyzing the theoretical basis of transferability and ensemble attacks. While empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of their method, more theoretical analysis on why and how transferable adversarial examples arise and how ensemble attacks improve transferability would be valuable.

- Defending against transfer-based adversarial attacks. The authors mention that studying transfer attacks can help identify model vulnerabilities and lead to more robust models. Developing defenses specifically tailored to transfer-based attacks is an important research direction.

- Applying the adaptive ensemble approach to other domains like NLP, speech, etc. The authors focus on computer vision but their ensemble attack methodology could be investigated for improving transferability in other data modalities and applications as well.

In summary, the key suggested future directions are: better transferability across diverse models, extending the ensemble attack to other scenarios, theoretical analysis of transfer attacks, developing defenses against transfer attacks, and applying the adaptive ensemble method to other domains. Improving robustness against black-box transfer attacks remains an open and crucial research area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an adaptive model ensemble adversarial attack called AdaEA to improve the transferability of adversarial examples across models with different architectures like CNNs and ViTs. It uses two key strategies - adaptive gradient modulation (AGM) and disparity-reduced filter (DRF). AGM adaptively controls the fusion of outputs from each model in the ensemble by monitoring their contribution towards the adversarial objective. This amplifies the transferable information in each model. DRF reduces the variance between model gradients to synchronize the update direction and avoid overfitting. Experiments show AdaEA outperforms existing ensemble attacks like Ens and SVRE, especially in transferring across diverse models like CNNs and ViTs. It also improves existing attacks when combined with them. The adaptive ensemble in AdaEA better captures intrinsic transferable adversarial information to boost attack transferability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new adaptive model ensemble adversarial attack called AdaEA to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. The key idea is to adaptively control the fusion of outputs from multiple surrogate models when generating adversarial examples, in order to better capture intrinsic transferable adversarial information. The method has two main components: adaptive gradient modulation (AGM) and disparity-reduced filter (DRF). AGM evaluates the contribution of each surrogate model to the overall adversarial objective, and uses this to modulate the gradient fusion during attack, amplifying models that provide more transferable information. DRF reduces the variance between model gradients to synchronize the update direction. Experiments demonstrate that AdaEA outperforms existing ensemble attacks by a large margin when transferring across diverse models, including between CNNs and Vision Transformers which have very different architectures. The method can also boost existing transfer-based attacks when used in combination.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel adaptive ensemble adversarial attack called AdaEA to improve transferability. It incorporates adaptive gradient modulation and disparity reduction to better capture intrinsic adversarial information when ensembling gradients from diverse surrogate models. Experiments show AdaEA significantly outperforms existing ensemble attacks, enabling stronger black-box attacks and transfer across very different model architectures. The method also combines effectively with existing transfer-based attacks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an adaptive model ensemble adversarial attack called AdaEA to improve the transferability of adversarial examples across models with different architectures. The key idea is to adaptively modulate the gradient fusion from each surrogate model based on an "adversarial ratio" that measures the contribution of that model to the overall adversarial objective. This allows transferable information to be amplified in the ensemble gradient. Additionally, a "disparity-reduced filter" is introduced to reduce variance between model gradients and synchronize the update direction. By incorporating these adaptive gradient modulation and disparity-reduced filtering strategies into the ensemble attack, AdaEA is able to effectively boost adversarial transferability, especially for diverse model architectures like CNNs and ViTs. Experiments demonstrate considerable improvements over existing ensemble attacks on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It focuses on improving the transferability of adversarial examples, which allows adversarial attacks to succeed against black-box models where the architectures and parameters are not known to the attacker. 

- The paper proposes an adaptive ensemble attack method called AdaEA to improve transferability. The key ideas are:

1) Adaptively modulate the ensemble of surrogate models by evaluating the "adversarial ratio" of each model's contribution and amplifying models that provide more transferable information. 

2) Reduce the disparity between ensemble gradients and individual gradients of models using a "disparity-reduced filter" to synchronize the update direction.

- Experiments show AdaEA outperforms existing ensemble attacks by large margins when transferring across diverse model architectures like CNNs and ViTs. It also improves attack performance when combined with existing gradient-based attacks.

- The improvements are attributed to AdaEA's ability to better capture and amplify the intrinsic transferable adversarial information from an ensemble of models with the proposed adaptive modulation and disparity reduction techniques.

In summary, this paper focuses on improving adversarial transferability, especially across diverse model architectures, via a new adaptive ensemble attack method. The core ideas are evaluating and amplifying transferability of each model and synchronizing update directions during ensemble.
