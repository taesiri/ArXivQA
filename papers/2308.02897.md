# [An Adaptive Model Ensemble Adversarial Attack for Boosting Adversarial   Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02897)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:How can we improve the transferability of adversarial examples generated from an ensemble of models with diverse architectures (like CNNs and ViTs)? The key hypothesis is that by adaptively controlling the fusion of outputs from each model in the ensemble, based on monitoring their contributions to the overall adversarial objective, they can better capture and amplify the intrinsic transferable adversarial information to boost attack transferability.To summarize, the main goal of this paper is to develop an effective ensemble attack method that can improve the transferability of adversarial examples across models with diverse architectures like CNNs and ViTs. The core ideas are using adaptive gradient modulation and disparity reduction techniques to better exploit the outputs of each model in the ensemble when crafting the adversarial examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes an adaptive model ensemble adversarial attack method called AdaEA to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. 2. The AdaEA adaptively controls the fusion of outputs from each surrogate model by monitoring their contribution discrepancy to the overall adversarial objective. This is done through the proposed adaptive gradient modulation (AGM) strategy.3. It introduces a disparity-reduced filter (DRF) to further synchronize the update direction by reducing the variance between surrogate models. 4. Experiments show that AdaEA can consistently outperform existing ensemble attacks and boost existing transfer-based attacks across diverse datasets. The results demonstrate the efficacy of AdaEA in capturing intrinsic transferable adversarial information.In summary, the key novelty and contribution is the proposed AdaEA method that can effectively improve adversarial transferability by adaptively ensembling surrogate models and reducing their variance. The AGM and DRF strategies enable AdaEA to amplify transferable adversarial information and synchronize update directions. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and versatility of AdaEA.
