## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems struggle with complex table queries, especially from PDFs with intricate tabular structures. This limits their accuracy for responding to table-related information requests.

Proposed Solution:  
- Store PDFs in retrieval database and extract tables separately using Camelot. 
- Enrich extracted tables by concatenating headers with row values to preserve context.
- Summarize enriched tabular data using fine-tuned Llama-2 model integrated in RAG architecture.
- Further augment data with contextual sense using ChatGPT 3.5 API and one-shot prompting.
- Add enriched tabular data to retrieval database with original PDFs.

Key Contributions:
- Novel strategy to improve accuracy of complex table queries in RAG systems by enhancing clarity of extracted tabular data.  
- Separate table extraction and multi-step contextual enrichment using specialized language models.
- Evaluation shows substantial boosts in accuracy metrics, especially for table queries, demonstrating efficacy of proposed techniques.
- Overall accuracy improved from 54% in baseline to 66% with full enriched data parsing, marking major advancement in complex table handling.

In summary, this paper introduces an innovative methodology to address the longstanding challenge of complex table queries in RAG-based information retrieval systems by augmenting extracted tabular data with enriched context and achieved notable gains in accuracy.
