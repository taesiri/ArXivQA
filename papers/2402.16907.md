# [Diffusion Posterior Proximal Sampling for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16907)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing diffusion-based image restoration methods follow a process inherited from unconditional image generation, starting the generation process with pure white noise and incorporating fully random noise at each step. However, this paradigm is unsuitable for image restoration tasks as the randomness leads to uncontrollable and unstable outcomes that fail to preserve identity information and result in over-smoothed images.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a refined paradigm named "Diffusion Posterior Proximal Sampling (DPPS)" for diffusion-based image restoration. The key ideas are:

1) Proximal Sampling: At each generative step, extract multiple candidate samples from the predicted distribution and select the one most consistent with the measurement signal. This ensures output stability and enhances quality.  

2) Aligned Initialization: Initialize the generation process with a combination of measurement signal and white noise, rather than pure noise. This provides supplementary information to facilitate faster convergence.

Main Contributions:

- Pioneers improving generation quality by exploiting sampling choices at each reverse diffusion step. 
- Introduces an efficient proximal sampling strategy aligned with measurement identity for diffusion image restoration.
- Extensive experiments validate superior performance across diverse tasks. Ablation studies verify the efficacy of the proposed components.
- Provides theoretical analysis showing the proposed method reduces variance compared to existing approaches with random sampling.

In summary, this paper innovates on exploiting stochastic sampling choices to enhance diffusion-based image restoration quality. The refined paradigm of proximal sampling and aligned initialization effectively stabilizes the generation process and improves output fidelity.
