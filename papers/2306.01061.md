# [Reimagining Retrieval Augmented Language Models for Answering Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01061)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: Can semi-parametric architectures enhanced with views (inspired by databases), a query analyzer/planner, and provenance tracking produce more powerful and transparent question answering systems compared to vanilla large language models?The key ideas seem to be:- Semi-parametric models that combine parametric knowledge (model parameters) with non-parametric knowledge (external data) can outperform large language models on some NLP tasks while being more efficient and transparent. - Enhancing semi-parametric models with database-inspired constructs like views (materialized results of operations over data), a query analyzer/planner module, and provenance tracking could make them even more powerful for question answering.- Views allow precomputing useful associations between data to answer certain questions more efficiently. - The query analyzer decomposes questions into subquestions and plans efficient strategies to answer them using retrievers and views.- Provenance tracking can explain model predictions in terms of the actual training/retrieval data used, reducing hallucination risk.So the central hypothesis seems to be that this proposed semi-parametric architecture with enhancements can produce better question answering systems compared to vanilla large language models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and reducing hallucinations. The paper aims to motivate this architecture and describe its components at a high-level.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing PostText, an enhanced semi-parametric architecture for question answering. The key ideas behind PostText are:1. Using views to integrate and pre-compute useful associations between different data sources, including multimodal data. This facilitates more efficient query answering.2. A query analyzer and planner module that decomposes queries into subqueries and determines the best strategy for answering them. This bears similarity to query optimization in databases.3. A provenance-aware answer generator that can track the evidence and data sources used to generate an answer. This provides transparency and helps mitigate issues like hallucination. 4. Preliminary experiments showing that using views helps PostText better answer aggregation queries compared to retrieval-based methods.In summary, the main contribution is presenting the PostText architecture that aims to make retrieval augmented language models more powerful, transparent, and efficient for question answering over multimodal data. The key ideas are using views, optimized query planning, and provenance tracking. Initial results lend support for the potential benefits of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an enhanced semi-parametric architecture called PostText for question answering that integrates model parameters with external knowledge sources, using database-style views, a query analyzer, and provenance tracking to potentially improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency.
