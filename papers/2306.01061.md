# [Reimagining Retrieval Augmented Language Models for Answering Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01061)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: Can semi-parametric architectures enhanced with views (inspired by databases), a query analyzer/planner, and provenance tracking produce more powerful and transparent question answering systems compared to vanilla large language models?The key ideas seem to be:- Semi-parametric models that combine parametric knowledge (model parameters) with non-parametric knowledge (external data) can outperform large language models on some NLP tasks while being more efficient and transparent. - Enhancing semi-parametric models with database-inspired constructs like views (materialized results of operations over data), a query analyzer/planner module, and provenance tracking could make them even more powerful for question answering.- Views allow precomputing useful associations between data to answer certain questions more efficiently. - The query analyzer decomposes questions into subquestions and plans efficient strategies to answer them using retrievers and views.- Provenance tracking can explain model predictions in terms of the actual training/retrieval data used, reducing hallucination risk.So the central hypothesis seems to be that this proposed semi-parametric architecture with enhancements can produce better question answering systems compared to vanilla large language models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and reducing hallucinations. The paper aims to motivate this architecture and describe its components at a high-level.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing PostText, an enhanced semi-parametric architecture for question answering. The key ideas behind PostText are:1. Using views to integrate and pre-compute useful associations between different data sources, including multimodal data. This facilitates more efficient query answering.2. A query analyzer and planner module that decomposes queries into subqueries and determines the best strategy for answering them. This bears similarity to query optimization in databases.3. A provenance-aware answer generator that can track the evidence and data sources used to generate an answer. This provides transparency and helps mitigate issues like hallucination. 4. Preliminary experiments showing that using views helps PostText better answer aggregation queries compared to retrieval-based methods.In summary, the main contribution is presenting the PostText architecture that aims to make retrieval augmented language models more powerful, transparent, and efficient for question answering over multimodal data. The key ideas are using views, optimized query planning, and provenance tracking. Initial results lend support for the potential benefits of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an enhanced semi-parametric architecture called PostText for question answering that integrates model parameters with external knowledge sources, using database-style views, a query analyzer, and provenance tracking to potentially improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:- The paper presents a novel semi-parametric architecture called PostText that integrates external knowledge sources (views) with neural network components like a query analyzer, planner, and answer generator. This differs from prior work on standard parametric language models like BERT and GPT-3 that rely solely on parameters learned from training data. - Retrieval augmented language models like REALM, RAG, and RETRO have shown benefits of integrating external text corpora via sparse retrieval. PostText aims to go further by supporting structured views over multi-modal data and explicit planning/reasoning modules.- The idea of having structured views over data connects to work in semantic parsing for question answering systems. However, PostText emphasizes handling multimodal data and using views for efficiency and explainability. It does not focus as much on mapping natural language precisely to logical forms.- For answer provenance, PostText relates conceptually to prior work on interpreting model predictions by linking them to influential training examples. However, by integrating retrieval it also provides provenance in terms of external data.- The preliminary experiments demonstrate potential gains over baseline retrieval augmented QA, providing initial validation. But more comprehensive empirical analysis is still needed to fully demonstrate the advantages of the proposed architecture.- Overall, PostText combines ideas from parametric/non-parametric ML, knowledge bases, semantic parsing, and model interpretability. The novelty is in the integrated architecture and applying concepts like views and provenance to neural QA. But further development is still needed to realize the envisioned benefits.In summary, PostText builds on prior work in multiple areas, but proposes an innovative direction for knowledge-enabled and explainable QA systems. The initial empirical results are promising but more experiments are needed to fully assess the strengths of the approach compared to other methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several promising future research directions:1. Further develop and investigate PostText to automatically determine what views to construct, how to generate and compare query plans, and how to measure answer quality with provenance. 2. Explore transferring database techniques like view selection, query optimization, etc. to PostText. See how PostText can be adapted to other NLP tasks beyond QA.3. Investigate how to measure the quality of answers with provenance. Develop efficient methods for training data attribution to explain model predictions.4. Examine security aspects like integrating public/private data and enabling fine-grained access control.5. Evaluate PostText on larger datasets and benchmarks. Conduct user studies to assess the usefulness of provenance. 6. Explore other applications of views like enabling compositionally over previous results and personal data.7. Develop the question analyzer and planner module further, drawing ideas from semantic parsing, query optimization, etc.8. Extend the knowledge retriever to handle more complex queries over structured data. Handle information loss when flattening knowledge graphs.9. Develop the tabular engine to explain results from table QA methods. Expand provenance computation for complex SQL queries.In summary, they propose advancing the technical capabilities of the PostText components and evaluating the overall system on broader tasks. There is also interest in expanding provenance, security, and personalization.
