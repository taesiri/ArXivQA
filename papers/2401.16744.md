# [ShaRP: Explaining Rankings with Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16744)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Algorithmic rankers are widely used to make impactful decisions, such as in hiring, admissions, and lending. Although score-based rankers are considered interpretable due to their scoring functions, the weights of the features often do not correspond to their actual importance for the ranked outcome. This happens because rankings are relative while scores are absolute. Hence, there is a need for methods to explain feature importance specifically for rankings.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes ShaRP, a framework based on Shapley values, to explain feature contributions to different aspects of a ranked outcome, including score, rank, pairwise preference, and top-k presence. ShaRP handles both score-based and learned ranking models since it relies on black-box access. It builds on the Quantitative Input Influence (QII) method and customizes it for ranking using appropriate Quantities of Interest (QoIs).  

Main Contributions:
1) Formalization of novel QoIs tailored to ranking: rank, top-k presence, and pairwise preference in addition to score.
2) An open-source Python library called ShaRP that implements QII and the proposed ranking QoIs.
3) Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets that demonstrate ShaRP's ability to provide insights into feature importance for rankings, under varying data distributions and scoring functions. The results illustrate that the impact of features on rank differs from their impact on score, and varies across rank strata.

In summary, the paper addresses the need for explainability methods customized to rankings. It proposes the ShaRP framework to explain feature contributions using Shapley values and appropriate ranking-specific QoIs. Thorough experimentation demonstrates ShaRP's usefulness in providing insights into data and models. The public ShaRP library will increase adoption of QII-based explanations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a comprehensive Shapley value-based framework called ShaRP for explaining and interpreting the contributions of features to various ranking-specific quantities of interest, including score, rank, pairwise preferences, and top-k presence; it shows that feature contributions depend substantially on data distributions and locality within the ranking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents ShaRP (Shapley for Rankings and Preferences), a framework that explains the contributions of features to different aspects of a ranked outcome, based on Shapley values. 

2. It provides an open-source library implementation of the Quantitative Input Influence (QII) framework, making this powerful method for explaining classifications and rankings available to the community.

3. It formalizes several natural quantities of interest (QoIs) appropriate for explaining rankings, including score, rank, pairwise preference, and top-k. These QoIs surface different insights about feature importance.

4. It showcases an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed methods on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the usefulness of the framework for qualitative analysis and providing insights into how feature importance depends on properties of the data even when the scoring function is fixed.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive Shapley value-based framework and robust software library for explaining and analyzing rankings and preferences using multiple complementary ranking-specific quantities of interest.

- Explainability - A core motivation is improving the explainability of rankings and understanding how features impact ranked outcomes.

- Local explanations - The paper can provide local explanations specific to a stratum in the ranking or a region.

- Synthetic datasets - Experiments include controlled tests on synthetic datasets to analyze how data properties and scoring functions impact feature importance.

- Learning to rank - Experiments also cover explaining rankings from learning-to-rank models.

Some other potential keywords include black-box models, feature contributions, lack of independence, strata, waterfalls, counterfactual fairness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes several new quantities of interest (QoIs) for explaining rankings, including score, rank, pairwise preference, and top-k. Can you explain in detail the computationbehind each of these QoIs? What makes them suitable for explaining rankings? 

2. The rank QoI relies on removing the item to be explained from the dataset and re-inserting intervened versions of it to compute the difference in ranks. Why is this necessary rather than just using the original dataset with the item included?

3. The top-k QoI checks whether intervened versions of an item move in or out of the top-k set. How exactly is this computation done? Why is it an appropriate QoI for explaining the top-k set?

4. The pairwise QoI explains the relative order between a pair of items. How does the computation handle coalitions of features from the two items? Why is a pairwise QoI useful?

5. The paper argues that lack of independence between item-level outcomes is a key challenge in explaining rankings. How do the proposed QoIs address this challenge? How is it different from explaining classifications?

6. Walk through Algorithm 1 step-by-step and explain how the Shapley values are computed for a given QoI. What is the role of the sampling? 

7. The experimental results showcase that feature importance depends substantially on the data distribution, even with a fixed scoring function. Provide some detailed examples of this from Figure 4.

8. Explain the subtle insights provided by the rank vs top-k vs pairwise QoIs in the analysis of the CS rankings dataset in Figures 5 and 6. What unique value does each provide?

9. The paper argues that score QoI becomes less useful in lower strata where items have similar scores. Explain why this happens and why rank or top-k may be more useful. Provide examples from the paper.  

10. The method relies on black-box access to the ranker. What are some approaches the authors propose to make the method more amenable to real applications where the ranker is unknown? What are other potential ideas?
