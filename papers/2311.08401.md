# [Fine-tuning Language Models for Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08401)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes fine-tuning language models to improve factuality of long-form text generation, without human labeling, by constructing preference pairs scored by consistency with references or by model confidence.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method for fine-tuning language models to generate more factual text without the need for human labeling or annotation. The key ideas are leveraging recent advances in estimating factuality of text automatically and using preference learning to optimize for factuality. Specifically, the authors develop two approaches for scoring the factuality of open-ended text - one based on consistency with a reference knowledge base, and a novel reference-free approach based on the model's own confidence in generated responses. Using either factuality score, they construct preference pairs between candidate model responses to a prompt, choosing the more factual response as preferred. Then with the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, they fine-tune a model to generate responses preferred according to the factuality score. Experiments on biography generation and medical question answering show this approach consistently reduces the factual error rate compared to supervised pre-training and other factuality-enhancing methods. A key advantage is not needing any human labels. The reference-free confidence-based scoring approach also avoids the need for an external knowledge base. This work provides a simple, scalable method to improve language model factuality without human effort.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method for fine-tuning language models to improve their factuality, without needing human annotations. Factuality of language models is important as incorrect "hallucinated" facts can spread misinformation. The key ideas are:

- They generate factuality preference pairs from an unlabeled prompt set in two ways: using an external knowledge base to score fact consistency (reference-based), or using the model's own confidence in claims as a proxy for factuality (reference-free). 

- The preference pairs are used to fine-tune the model with direct preference optimization, which trains on rankings over responses rather than an explicit reward. This enables efficient learning from non-imitation objectives like factuality.

- Experiments on biography generation and medical QA show their automated factuality tuning reduces the factual error rate substantially compared to RLHF and decoding methods targeting factuality. For example, on biographies with a 7B model their method reduces the error rate by 58% over the baseline.

- The reference-free confidence scoring method provides a way to improve factuality without any external knowledge source. Qualitatively, it produces more direct and objective text compared to the more conversatial style of RLHF models.

- Their method demonstrates a scalable way to improve language model factuality without human supervision. It also composes with existing methods that modify decoding, suggesting complementarity of different techniques.

In summary, the key contribution is a practical approach to optimizing language models for generating factual text in long-form settings, without any human annotation. The method leverages recent advances in estimating factual consistency and preference-based RL to improve factuality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to fine-tune language models for improved factuality in long-form text generation tasks like biography writing and medical QA, without needing any human annotations, by constructing preference datasets scored for factuality using either reference-based consistency checks or a novel reference-free method leveraging model confidence.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

Can language models be fine-tuned to generate more factual text without needing human labeling, by leveraging recent advances in estimating factuality?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Existing methods for automatically estimating the factuality or truthfulness of text can be used to generate training data in the form of preference rankings over candidate texts. 

2) Fine-tuning language models to optimize factuality preferences, using the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, will improve their factual accuracy on held-out test topics/prompts.

3) This factuality fine-tuning approach can work both with reference-based truthfulness measures (that compare to external knowledge) as well as reference-free measures based solely on the model's confidence.

4) Factuality tuning provides complementary benefits to existing decoding strategies for improving factuality.

So in summary, the main research question is whether recent advances in automated factuality estimation can be leveraged to improve language model factuality without human labels, using preference learning. The key hypotheses test whether this factuality tuning approach works across different truthfulness measures and composes with other decoding methods.
