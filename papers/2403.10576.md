# [Ignore Me But Don't Replace Me: Utilizing Non-Linguistic Elements for   Pretraining on the Cybersecurity Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Cybersecurity texts often contain non-linguistic elements (NLEs) like URLs, IP addresses, etc. It is unclear if standard pretraining strategies like masked language modeling (MLM) are suitable for such elements. 
- Simply removing NLEs could lose valuable information. But including them as-is may not benefit the model.
- No previous work has studied optimal strategies to handle NLEs, especially for the cybersecurity domain where they are very frequent.

Method:
- Identify 7 common types of NLEs in cybersecurity text using regex. 
- Group into semi-linguistic (human-generated like URLs) and fully non-linguistic (protocol-generated like hashes).
- Propose modifications to MLM: Avoid masking fully non-linguistic parts, optionally mask semi-linguistic parts.  
- Also propose auxiliary NLE token classification task during pretraining.
- Evaluate combinations of above strategies by pretraining variants of RoBERTa on a custom cybersecurity corpus.

Results:
- Replacing NLEs harms performance on probing tasks, especially near NLEs.  
- Selectively avoiding NLEs in MLM + auxiliary NLE classification works best overall.
- Train CyBERTuned model with this method, outperforming prior cybersecurity PLMs on most downstream tasks.

Main Contributions:
- First work to study optimal pretraining strategies for texts with NLEs.
- Provides empirical evidence that naively replacing NLEs can reduce model capability.
- Proposes methods selective MLM and auxiliary NLE classification to improve modeling of texts with NLEs.
- Develops CyBERTuned, a new state-of-the-art cybersecurity domain PLM using these methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates different strategies for pretraining language models on cybersecurity text, finding that selectively masking tokens while jointly training to classify non-linguistic elements works best, and uses this approach to develop CyBERTuned, a cybersecurity domain language model that outperforms prior models on downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating different strategies for pretraining language models on cybersecurity text data that contains non-linguistic elements (NLEs) such as URLs, IP addresses, etc. Specifically:

1) The paper investigates different strategies for handling NLEs during pretraining - replacing them, avoiding masking them, or jointly training to classify them. It finds that a combination of avoiding masking NLEs while also classifying them works best.

2) The paper trains a new cybersecurity domain language model called CyBERTuned using this proposed methodology of selective masking + NLE classification. It shows CyBERTuned outperforms prior cybersecurity LM models on several downstream tasks.

3) The paper provides an analysis of the frequency of different types of NLEs in cybersecurity text vs general domain text, showing NLEs are much more common in cybersecurity. This motivates the need to adapt pretraining strategies for this domain.

In summary, the key contribution is developing and evaluating domain-customized pretraining strategies to effectively incorporate non-linguistic elements that are prevalent in cybersecurity text data. The end result is the CyBERTuned model that advances the state-of-the-art for cybersecurity domain language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What was the motivation behind investigating different strategies for pretraining on cybersecurity text corpora? Why did the authors believe established pretraining methodologies may not be optimal for this domain?

2. What types of non-linguistic elements (NLEs) did the authors identify as commonly occurring in cybersecurity texts? What was their process for extracting and identifying instances of these NLEs? 

3. How did the authors categorize NLEs into semi-linguistic elements (SLEs) and fully non-linguistic elements (FNLEs)? What was the rationale behind making this distinction?

4. Can you explain the two proposed methods of utilizing extracted NLE spans to guide pretraining - NLE classification and selective MLM? How do these methods differ from the standard MLM procedure?

5. What were some key findings from comparing the different pretraining strategies? What does this suggest about the effectiveness of replacing versus selectively masking NLEs?

6. Why do you think the Mask-Semis + NLEC strategy worked best overall? What are the possible benefits of allowing masking on SLEs but avoiding FNLEs?  

7. How large was the final cybersecurity text corpus used for pretraining CyBERTuned? How did the distribution of NLEs compare to general domain corpora like Wikipedia and C4?

8. Can you describe some of the downstream tasks and probing tasks used to evaluate the pretrained models? What are some relative advantages/disadvantages of these techniques?

9. How did CyBERTuned compare to previous cybersecurity domain models like CyBERT and SecureBERT on the various downstream tasks? What does this suggest about the benefits of customizing pretraining? 

10. What are some limitations of the approach taken in this work? What are some ways the authors suggest the methodology could be extended or improved in future work?
