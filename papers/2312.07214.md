# [Exploring Large Language Models to Facilitate Variable Autonomy for   Human-Robot Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07214)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT into human-robot teaming environments to facilitate variable autonomy through verbal communication. As autonomous robots become more commonplace, effectively collaborating with them requires balancing robot autonomy with human control needs. Shared control and variable autonomy concepts aim to achieve optimal human-robot task sharing, and language could be a useful mechanism. However, mapping unstructured language to structured robot behaviors is challenging, and little research has examined how speech input changes human-robot interaction dynamics.  

Proposed Solution
The paper introduces a novel LLM-powered multi-robot VR framework with a GPT core controlling each agent. Users verbally instruct the robots using natural language via speech recognition and synthesis. OpenAI function calls bridge unstructured speech and structured actions. A user study with 12 participants investigates the effectiveness of GPT-4 for multi-agent coordination and reveals user interaction strategies when conversing naturally with robots.

Key Contributions 
1) A Unity-based multi-agent VR framework powered by GPT for exploring LLM-enabled human-robot teaming and variable autonomy.
2) Insights into users' strategies and behaviors when interacting with LLM robot agents, highlighting issues like simple instructional dialog, expectations mismatch regarding robot autonomy, and tradeoffs between command optimization and conversation engagement.  
3) Lessons learned regarding GPT feasibility for robot control, including pros/cons of function calls, non-determinism drawbacks, needed calibration, importance of sensory alignment, lag issues, and inter-robot communication requirements.

The paper concludes that employing LLMs for variable autonomy in human-robot teaming has promise but requires careful system design and understanding of psychological interaction dynamics. A balanced, multidisciplinary approach is necessary to realize the full potential.
