# [DeepEn2023: Energy Datasets for Edge Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Climate change is a huge global challenge and AI technologies could help address it. However, very little research focuses on making AI systems themselves environmentally sustainable. 
- There is a lack of comprehensive energy consumption datasets to understand the carbon footprint of edge AI systems, especially on-device learning which is becoming more widespread.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes large-scale energy consumption datasets across 3 levels - kernel, model and application level, named "DeepEn2023". 
- The datasets cover a range of kernels, DNN models and popular edge AI applications executed on various mobile hardware. 
- Detailed power measurements are captured using a Monsoon power monitor. Energy and carbon emission metrics are calculated from the power data.

Key Contributions:
- Provides the research community detailed benchmarks and transparency into the energy efficiency and carbon footprint of on-device deep learning. 
- The granular datasets can help optimize and reduce carbon emissions of edge AI systems.  
- Allows comparing energy efficiency of different kernels, models and applications on mobile hardware.
- Can shift mindsets to design environmentally sustainable edge AI systems and applications.
- Overall, DeepEn2023 facilitates crucial research towards assessing and mitigating the climate impact of proliferating edge AI.

In summary, the paper introduces much-needed comprehensive energy consumption datasets across multiple levels of edge AI systems to enable transparency and research towards sustainable on-device deep learning.
