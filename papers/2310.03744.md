# [Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that simple modifications to the LLaVA framework, namely using an MLP connector and incorporating more academic task-oriented data with response formatting prompts, can lead to improved performance and establish stronger baselines for instruction-following large language models. 

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:

- Using an MLP rather than a linear projection for the vision-language connector in LLaVA can improve multimodal capabilities.

- Including more academic VQA datasets and using explicit response formatting prompts allows LLaVA to balance short-form and long-form answers, enhancing performance on both academic benchmarks and more conversational tasks. 

- These simple modifications enable LLaVA to achieve state-of-the-art results across a range of 11 benchmarks with high efficiency and using only public data.

The central research question is whether these minor tweaks to the LLaVA architecture and training data can lead to substantial gains, creating easy-to-reproduce yet highly performant baselines. The results appear to confirm their hypothesis, showing SOTA results with modest compute and data requirements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing simple yet effective improvements to the LLaVA architecture to establish stronger and more feasible baselines for large multimodal models (LMMs). The two key improvements are:

1. Using an MLP cross-modal connector instead of a linear projection layer. This improves the representation power of connecting vision and language modalities.

2. Incorporating academic task-oriented VQA datasets into the training data along with a specific response formatting prompt. This enhances the model's visual reasoning capabilities while still allowing it to generate free-form responses. 

The resulting model, termed LLaVA-1.5, achieves state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks, using only publicly available data and modest compute resources. The simplicity and reproducibility of the improved LLaVA model makes it an accessible baseline for future LMM research.

In summary, the main contribution is developing straightforward but impactful tweaks to the original LLaVA architecture to create a new strong baseline LMM that combines high performance, data efficiency, and accessibility. The improvements demonstrate the power of the LLaVA framework and the importance of instruction tuning data over extensive pretraining.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding, the key points of the paper are:

The paper proposes simple modifications to the LLaVA architecture to establish stronger baselines for visual instruction following. By using an MLP projection layer instead of linear, adding academic VQA data with proper response format prompts, and scaling up the image resolution, LLM size, and training data, they achieve SOTA results on 11 benchmarks with high efficiency. The final 13B model uses only 1.2M public data, finishes training in 1 day on 1 machine, and outperforms more complex approaches that use orders of magnitude more data. The results suggest visual instruction tuning plays a bigger role than pretraining and that LLaVA's architecture is powerful and data-efficient for multimodal instruction following. The improved baselines aim to make SOTA more accessible for open LMM research.

In summary, the paper presents simple and efficient modifications to LLaVA that establish new SOTA baselines for visual instruction following using minimal data and compute.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other recent research on large multimodal models and visual instruction tuning:

- Architecture: The proposed LLaVA-1.5 model uses a fairly simple and standard architecture for large multimodal models, consisting of a visual encoder (CLIP), language model (LLaMA/Vicuna), and cross-modal MLP projection. This is simpler than some other recent works like InstructBLIP and Qwen-VL that incorporate additional components like visual resamplers.

- Training data: A key contribution is showing strong performance with relatively small amounts of training data - only around 600K image-text pairs for pretraining and 665K instruction examples for tuning. This is orders of magnitude less than many other recent models that use hundreds of millions to billions of training examples.

- Performance: Despite the simple architecture and small training set, LLaVA-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results across a range of 11 benchmark tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the cross-modal MLP and incorporating task-specific data.

- Efficiency: By using a single 8-A100 node, the full training of LLaVA-1.5 takes only around 1 day. This is much faster than most other large multimodal models which can take weeks or months to train. The efficiency and public data make this model more accessible.

- Limitations: The lack of visual resampling may limit scaling compared to models like InstructBLIP and Qwen-VL. It also currently can only process single images rather than multiple images. There are still some issues with hallucination that need to be addressed.

Overall, the simplicity, efficiency, strong performance, and reproducibility with public data make this a compelling baseline model for the field of large multimodal language models. The results challenge some assumptions like the need for billions of training examples. Future work can build on this foundation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the paper:

- Developing a sample-efficient visual resampler that can converge quickly with a comparable amount of training data as LLaVA. This could enable further scaling up of instruction-following multimodal models.

- Enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of the model in certain domains by using a more capable language model and high-quality, targeted visual instruction tuning data.

- Enabling the model to process multiple images simultaneously by creating instruction-following data with multiple images.

- Improving the model's capability for multilingual multimodal instruction following without any finetuning on multilingual data.

- Reducing the propensity for hallucination and misinformation further, to make the model safer for critical applications like medicine.

- Overcoming the limitations on context length to allow even longer conversations and instructions.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more efficient and scalable model architectures, enhancing reasoning and problem-solving skills, improving multilinguality and safety, and increasing the input context length. The authors suggest progress in these areas could pave the way for more capable and generalizable multimodal assistants.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes simple modifications to the LLaVA architecture to establish stronger baselines for visual instruction following. The modifications include using an MLP instead of a linear projection for the vision-language connector, increasing the image resolution, and incorporating more academic visual question answering datasets. 

The enhanced LLaVA model, termed LLaVA-1.5, achieves state-of-the-art results across 11 benchmarks, using only 1.2 million publicly available data samples. Compared to other recent methods like InstructBLIP and Qwen-VL that use orders of magnitude more training data, LLaVA-1.5 obtains better performance with a simpler architecture and much less compute. The strong performance of LLaVA-1.5 with high sample efficiency highlights the power of its fully-connected vision-language architecture. The easily reproducible model provides an accessible baseline for future visual instruction following research.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes two main improvements to the LLaVA framework for visual instruction tuning:

1. Using an MLP projection layer instead of a linear projection layer as the vision-language cross-modal connector. Inspired by improved performance from MLP projections in self-supervised learning methods like MoCo v2, the authors find that using a simple 2-layer MLP projection boosts LLaVA's multimodal capabilities compared to the original linear projection design. 

2. Incorporating academic task-oriented VQA datasets into the instruction tuning data with specific response formatting prompts. The authors show that naive merging of VQA data can make models overfit to short answers, but using prompts that clearly indicate the desired response format (e.g. "Answer with a single word") allows the model to properly adjust between short and long answers. This gives improvements without needing complex VQA-to-conversational data conversion.

The combination of these two simple modifications, along with scaling up the image resolution, language model size, and incorporating more instruction tuning data, leads to state-of-the-art performance on a diverse set of 11 benchmarks using only publicly available data and modest compute resources. The improved baseline is intended to be an accessible and reproducible reference for future multimodal research.
