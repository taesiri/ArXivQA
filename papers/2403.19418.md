# [Constants of Motion for Conserved and Non-conserved Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19418)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper introduces a novel approach to computing constants of motion (conserved quantities) for both conservative and dissipative dynamical systems using a combination of machine learning modeling and Lie symmetry analysis for differential equations. Specifically, the method harnesses small/infinitesimal changes in variables modeled by a machine learning technique called FJet to match with the symmetries studied by Lie theory. The end goal is to obtain analytical expressions for constants of motion, even in the presence of dissipation, starting only from time series data.

Proposed Solution: 
The key idea is that FJet models small changes in variables over a timestep as functions $h_1$, $h_2$, while Lie symmetries represent continuous changes of variables parameterized by $\epsilon$. By identifying $h_1/\epsilon$, $h_2/\epsilon$ with the Lie symmetry generators $\eta$, $\eta^{(1)}$, the method of characteristics can be used to obtain an expression that integrates to a constant of motion $r$. This is applied to damped harmonic oscillators in 1D and 2D, yielding new conserved quantities in the presence of damping, related to the total energy (oscillator + environment).

Main Contributions:
- Derives constants of motion analytically for 1D damped harmonic oscillator in underdamped, overdamped and critically damped regimes
- Identifies constant $r$ as manifestation of total energy conservation 
- Computes constants for 2D anisotropic oscillator, including damped case
- Finds constant that generalizes angular momentum for 2D oscillator for any frequency ratio
- Generalizes approach and constant $r$ to N dimensions

The method starts from generic time series data, works for dissipative systems, produces multiple constants from a single dataset, and yields new physical insights related to conserved quantities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an approach that combines machine learning and Lie symmetry techniques to determine constants of motion for both conservative and dissipative dynamical systems from time series data, and applies it to damped harmonic oscillators in one and two dimensions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It presents an approach to derive constants of motion (i.e. conserved quantities) for both conservative and dissipative dynamical systems using machine learning models combined with Lie symmetry techniques. 

2. It applies this approach to find new constants of motion for the damped 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, including interpretations in terms of the total energy.

3. For the 2D oscillator, it identifies a constant that generalizes angular momentum and applies for any ratio of frequencies. It also shows how to derive polynomial constants for commensurate frequencies.  

4. The approach is shown to work for arbitrary dimensions, yielding multiple constants from a single data set.

5. Comparisons are made to related work, including advantages of the presented approach in terms of needing only a single generic data set and finding multiple constants. Connections are also made to previous analytical work using Lie symmetries.

In summary, the key innovation is using machine learning models within a Lie symmetry framework to extract multiple conserved quantities from a single data set, even in the presence of dissipation. This allows more physical insight to be gained from time series data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Machine learning - The paper discusses using machine learning techniques like the FJet method to model dynamical systems and discover physical laws from time series data.

- Differential equations - The dynamics of systems like harmonic oscillators are modeled by differential equations. The paper analyzes symmetries and invariants of these equations.

- Lie symmetries - The theory of Lie symmetries for differential equations, which relates to finding continuous transformations that map solutions to other solutions, is a key technique used.

- Constants of motion - A major focus of the paper is determining constants of motion, also known as conserved quantities, for both conservative and dissipative dynamical systems using Lie theory and FJet models. 

- Damped harmonic oscillators - The main examples studied are variants of damped 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, including underdamped, overdamped and critically damped cases.

- Pseudoenergies - Pseudoenergies are constants related to but distinct from the usual energies of damped oscillators.

- Angular momentum - For 2D isotropic oscillators, one recovered constant is identified as the angular momentum. A more general constant is shown to reduce to angular momentum under certain conditions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the FJet approach model the dynamics of a system using time series data? Can you explain the key steps involved and how small changes in phase space variables are utilized?

2) How do Lie symmetry techniques relate small/infinitesimal changes in variables to the FJet approach? Explain the symmetry transformations used and how the method of characteristics is employed. 

3) Walk through the details of how the integrating factor ($\rho$) is determined in this approach, starting from the known constant $r$. Explain why determining $\rho$ can be non-trivial.  

4) The interpretation of the constant $r$ in terms of total energy conservation is insightful. Explain this interpretation and why the 1D damped oscillator example belongs to a wider class of models exhibiting this.

5) The 2D anisotropic oscillator offers additional symmetry compared to the 1D case. How is this manifested in the constants of motion derived? Discuss the interpretations when frequencies are commensurate versus incommensurate.  

6) Explain the generalization of angular momentum that is identified for the 2D anisotropic oscillator, for arbitrary frequency ratios. How does this constant relate to traditional constants like angular momentum?

7) Discuss the derivation of constants of motion in the damped, anisotropic 2D oscillator case. Why is the form similar to the undamped case unexpected? What does this suggest more broadly?

8) Walk through the details behind verifying that the computed 2D constants are indeed independent of time. What exact solutions and Poisson bracket relations are used?

9) The method discovers constants for non-conservative, dissipative dynamics in addition to conservative ones. Contrast this capability versus other related methods in the literature.

10) Discuss how the infinitesimal symmetry modeling of FJet and Lie techniques lends itself naturally to computing constants of motion. What are the limitations and areas for further generalization?
