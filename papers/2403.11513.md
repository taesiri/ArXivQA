# [Visual Preference Inference: An Image Sequence-Based Preference   Reasoning in Tabletop Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11513)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on the problem of inferring underlying human preferences from a sequence of raw visual observations in tabletop manipulation environments. 
- Specifically, the goal is to extract users' preferences related to visual attributes of objects, such as color, shape, and spatial arrangements, solely from visual input.

Proposed Method:  
- The paper proposes a new method called Chain-of-Visual-Residuals (CoVR) to address this problem. 

- CoVR has two main components:
   1) Visual Reasoning Descriptor (VRD): Maps consecutive image pairs into natural language descriptions that capture changes in semantic attributes and geometric relationships between objects.
   2) Preference Reasoning Descriptor (PRD): Predicts suitable preferences based on the visual reasoning descriptions and full image sequence.

- The key idea is to explicitly prompt the model to reason about visual differences between images and then leverage that understanding to infer overall human preferences. 

Contributions:
- Formulates a new Visual Preference Inference (VPI) task to infer user preferences from visual observations in manipulation settings.
- Proposes CoVR method that connects visual understanding to preference reasoning through intermediate reasoning steps. 
- Demonstrates CoVR's ability to effectively predict diverse user preferences related to object color, shape and arrangements in both simulation and real-world tabletop environments.
- The results show clear improvements over baseline approaches that do not explicitly incorporate visual reasoning prompts.

In summary, the key contribution is a new prompting-based approach to translate visual observations into inferred user preferences by explicitly linking computer vision and preference modeling through natural language scene descriptions.
