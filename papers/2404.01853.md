# [Pairwise Similarity Distribution Clustering for Noisy Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Noisy label learning aims to train deep neural networks using samples with incorrect labels. The main challenge is how to deal with inaccurate supervision caused by wrong labels.
- Existing methods take either a label correction approach to update noisy labels or a sample selection approach to identify clean samples. But they still suffer under high label noise rates.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Pairwise Similarity Distribution Clustering (PSDC) method to divide training samples into a clean set and a noisy set. 
- It computes pairwise similarity between sample pairs to represent structure rather than relying on noisy labels. 
- It uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model the distribution of similarities within a class.
- Samples are assigned to clean/noisy set based on which distribution they likely belong to according to GMM.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a sample selection method using pairwise structure and GMM which is robust to label noise.
- Provides theorems showing PSDC has a wider tolerance to noise compared to methods based on losses or divergences.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR and Clothing1M datasets under both symmetric and asymmetric noise.
- Ablation studies demonstrate effectiveness of similarity distribution and GMM components.

In summary, the key idea is to exploit sample structure instead of noisy labels for selection. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments verify PSDC is more robust for sample selection, enabling better semi-supervised learning under label noise.
