# [LibriTTS-R: A Restored Multi-Speaker Text-to-Speech Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18802)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is whether applying speech restoration to improve the audio quality of the LibriTTS corpus leads to improved performance of text-to-speech (TTS) models trained on the restored data. 

Specifically, the authors hypothesize that by restoring the audio in LibriTTS to higher quality using a speech restoration model, they can create a new dataset called LibriTTS-R that will enable training higher quality TTS models compared to training on the original LibriTTS data.

The key points are:

- LibriTTS is a large multi-speaker TTS corpus but has audio quality issues that limit TTS performance. 

- The authors apply a speech restoration model called Miipher to clean up and improve the audio quality of LibriTTS, creating a new dataset called LibriTTS-R.

- They evaluate LibriTTS-R by training TTS models on it and comparing to models trained on original LibriTTS data. 

- Results show TTS models trained on LibriTTS-R achieve significantly higher quality and naturalness, validating their hypothesis that restoring the audio improves TTS performance.

So in summary, the central research question is whether applying speech restoration to LibriTTS can create a better dataset for training higher quality TTS models. The experiments aim to demonstrate that LibriTTS-R enables improved TTS compared to the original LibriTTS corpus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the release of LibriTTS-R, a restored and improved version of the LibriTTS speech corpus for text-to-speech (TTS). The key points are:

- LibriTTS-R was created by applying a speech restoration model called Miipher to the original LibriTTS corpus. This improved the sound quality compared to the original LibriTTS.

- Subjective evaluations showed the speech naturalness of a TTS model trained on LibriTTS-R was significantly improved compared to one trained on the original LibriTTS, and reached near parity with real human speech.

- LibriTTS-R has the same amount of data (585 hours), speakers (2,456), and texts as LibriTTS, but with enhanced audio quality. This makes it a large, free, multi-speaker corpus suitable for training high-quality TTS models.

- The corpus is freely released for download to facilitate TTS research. Comparisons showed it enables better TTS models compared to the widely used but lower audio quality LibriTTS.

In summary, the key contribution is creating and releasing an improved version of an existing TTS corpus to advance research - LibriTTS-R with better audio but same speakers/texts as LibriTTS. The evaluations and release enable the community to train better TTS models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces LibriTTS-R, a restored and improved version of the LibriTTS multi-speaker speech dataset for text-to-speech, created by applying speech restoration to the original LibriTTS samples.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in text-to-speech systems:

- The focus on creating a large, high-quality public dataset (LibriTTS-R) for TTS training is an important contribution. Many state-of-the-art TTS systems are trained on proprietary datasets that are not publicly available, making it difficult for researchers to reproduce results. Providing 585 hours of restored speech builds nicely on the original LibriTTS corpus.

- The application of speech restoration to improve the quality of the LibriTTS samples is a novel technique in this domain. The authors leverage recent advances in speech restoration models like Miipher to clean the audio rather than recording new samples. This is an efficient way to create a large clean dataset.

- The experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in naturalness and quality of TTS systems trained on LibriTTS-R compared to the original LibriTTS, highlighting the benefits of the restored corpus. The quality reaches near human-level.

- The work fits into the broader recent trend of leveraging generative modeling and restoration techniques to improve TTS. Other examples include using restoration models to make TTS more robust to noise and using generative models like GANs to improve prosody. 

- The paper builds directly on the authors' previous work on Miipher and other speech restoration models. The application to creating TTS datasets is a logical next step.

- Compared to other TTS datasets, LibriTTS-R stands out in terms of size and diversity of speakers (2456 speakers). This could make it useful for training multi-speaker TTS models.

Overall, I would say this paper makes a nice incremental contribution, particularly with the public release of the dataset. It demonstrates a promising new application of speech restoration in the TTS domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Investigating joint training of the acoustic model and vocoder in the TTS system using the LibriTTS-R dataset. The current work trained these components separately. Joint training could further improve quality.

- Exploring semi-supervised and weakly-supervised training techniques leveraging the large amount of data in LibriTTS-R. This could help train models with less manual annotation effort.

- Developing advanced speech restoration techniques to further improve the quality of noisy speech datasets like LibriTTS for TTS use. 

- Applying the speech restoration approach to other large but noisy TTS datasets to create enhanced versions of them.

- Leveraging the high-quality LibriTTS-R dataset to develop multi-speaker TTS with more controllable prosody and speaking styles.

- Using LibriTTS-R to train end-to-end TTS models that perform spectrogram prediction and vocoding jointly in a single network.

- Evaluating the LibriTTS-R dataset for training voice conversion systems to transform speaker identity while retaining linguistic content and prosody.

In summary, the authors suggest leveraging the new LibriTTS-R corpus in various ways to advance TTS research by enabling high-quality multi-speaker model training. They also suggest developing more advanced speech restoration techniques to further improve noisy TTS datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces LibriTTS-R, a new high-quality multi-speaker speech dataset for text-to-speech (TTS). It is derived by applying the Miipher speech restoration model to the LibriTTS corpus to improve the audio quality. LibriTTS consists of 585 hours of speech from 2,456 speakers. Experiments show that LibriTTS-R samples have significantly better sound quality compared to the original LibriTTS based on mean opinion score and side-by-side tests. A TTS model trained on LibriTTS-R also achieves higher naturalness, comparable to the LibriTTS-R ground truth. The corpus is freely available for download to advance TTS research. Overall, LibriTTS-R provides a large-scale, high-quality public dataset to train state-of-the-art TTS systems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new speech dataset called LibriTTS-R which is designed for text-to-speech (TTS) use. LibriTTS-R is derived from the existing LibriTTS dataset by applying speech restoration to improve the sound quality. The LibriTTS dataset consists of 585 hours of speech data at 24kHz sampling rate from 2,456 speakers and corresponding texts. It was created from the LibriSpeech corpus which is used for training automatic speech recognition systems. However, the sound quality of LibriTTS is not adequate for training high-quality TTS models. To address this, the authors applied a text-informed speech restoration model called Miipher to the samples in LibriTTS to create the improved LibriTTS-R dataset. The samples in LibriTTS-R have the same texts and speakers as the original LibriTTS but with enhanced audio quality. 

Experiments show that the ground-truth samples in LibriTTS-R have significantly better sound quality compared to LibriTTS based on mean opinion score and side-by-side preference tests. Also, a TTS model trained on LibriTTS-R achieved naturalness on par with the LibriTTS-R ground-truth, and significantly better than TTS models trained on the original LibriTTS corpus. This demonstrates that LibriTTS-R enables training high-quality TTS models. The LibriTTS-R corpus is freely available to download and can help advance TTS research by providing a large-scale, high-quality public dataset.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new speech dataset called LibriTTS-R which is derived from LibriTTS by applying speech restoration. LibriTTS consists of 585 hours of speech data from 2,456 speakers and corresponding texts. To improve the sound quality of LibriTTS, the authors use a text-informed speech restoration model called Miipher. Miipher uses a DF-Conformer-based feature cleaner to predict clean w2v-BERT features from the noisy LibriTTS waveforms. It also uses textual features from PnG-BERT and speaker embeddings. The cleaned w2v-BERT features are then synthesized into waveforms using the WaveFit neural vocoder. By subjective evaluations, the authors show LibriTTS-R has improved sound quality compared to LibriTTS. A TTS model trained on LibriTTS-R also achieves better naturalness, comparable to the LibriTTS-R ground truth.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?
