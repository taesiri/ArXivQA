# [LibriTTS-R: A Restored Multi-Speaker Text-to-Speech Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18802)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether applying speech restoration to improve the audio quality of the LibriTTS corpus leads to improved performance of text-to-speech (TTS) models trained on the restored data. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that by restoring the audio in LibriTTS to higher quality using a speech restoration model, they can create a new dataset called LibriTTS-R that will enable training higher quality TTS models compared to training on the original LibriTTS data.The key points are:- LibriTTS is a large multi-speaker TTS corpus but has audio quality issues that limit TTS performance. - The authors apply a speech restoration model called Miipher to clean up and improve the audio quality of LibriTTS, creating a new dataset called LibriTTS-R.- They evaluate LibriTTS-R by training TTS models on it and comparing to models trained on original LibriTTS data. - Results show TTS models trained on LibriTTS-R achieve significantly higher quality and naturalness, validating their hypothesis that restoring the audio improves TTS performance.So in summary, the central research question is whether applying speech restoration to LibriTTS can create a better dataset for training higher quality TTS models. The experiments aim to demonstrate that LibriTTS-R enables improved TTS compared to the original LibriTTS corpus.
