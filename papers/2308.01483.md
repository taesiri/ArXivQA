# [Efficient neural supersampling on a novel gaming dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can we develop an efficient neural algorithm for super-sampling (upscaling) rendered gaming content that is faster and maintains a similar level of quality compared to existing methods?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A neural network architecture can be designed that is significantly faster (4x) than prior work by Xiao et al. for gaming super-resolution while achieving similar accuracy.2) Additional data modalities like motion vectors, depth, and graphics features like jittering and mipmap biasing can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of neural gaming super-resolution. 3) A new dataset for gaming super-resolution can advance research in this area by providing a standard benchmark to measure algorithm performance.So in summary, the central focus is on proposing a faster neural network architecture for real-time gaming super-resolution, demonstrating the utility of additional graphical modalities, and releasing a dataset to facilitate further research. The main hypothesis is that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art efficiency without compromising accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. The authors release a new dataset called QRISP designed specifically for developing and researching super-resolution algorithms for gaming content. The dataset provides multiple modalities (color, depth, motion vectors) rendered at different resolutions with graphics features like jittering and mipmap biasing. 2. The authors propose an efficient neural architecture for gaming super-resolution that leverages the auxiliary modalities like motion vectors and depth. Their model is 4x faster than prior work by Xiao et al. while maintaining the same accuracy.3. The proposed model outperforms the commercial DLSS 2.2 solution in terms of visual quality when trained on the QRISP dataset.In summary, the key contributions are a new dataset to facilitate gaming super-resolution research, a fast neural network architecture that leverages this data, and results showing it can outperform existing commercial solutions. The authors believe this dataset and model architecture will help drive further progress in super-resolution for gaming applications.
