# [Online Continual Learning For Interactive Instruction Following Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07548)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most prior work in embodied AI assumes agents have access to all the training data upfront. However, this is unrealistic as agents may need to continuously learn new behaviors and adapt to new environments after deployment. Simply fine-tuning agents leads to catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge. There is a need for continual learning methods that allow agents to incrementally learn new behaviors and environments without forgetting.

Proposed Solutions: 
This paper introduces two continual learning setups on the ALFRED benchmark:

1) Behavior Incremental Learning (Behavior-IL): Agents incrementally learn new behaviors (e.g. examine, heat, pick & place) while retaining past knowledge.

2) Environment Incremental Learning (Environment-IL): Agents incrementally adapt to new environments (e.g. kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms) while retaining past knowledge. 

This is more realistic than having all training data available upfront. A key challenge is mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Prior methods use knowledge distillation but store outdated logits or require task boundaries. 

The paper proposes Confidence-Aware Moving Average (CAMA) to update logits. The key idea is to weight the new and old logits based on the model's confidence scores on ground truth labels, without requiring task boundaries. High confidence implies new logits likely contain accurate knowledge to update old logits. This prevents old logits from becoming outdated.

Contributions:
- Propose Behavior-IL and Environment-IL for continual learning in embodied AI 
- Propose CAMA to effectively update logits based on confidence scores
- Empirically show CAMA outperforms prior state-of-the-art on the ALFRED benchmark, highlighting its ability to incrementally learn behaviors and adapt to new environments without catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two continual learning setups for embodied agents to incrementally learn new behaviors (Behavior-IL) and new environments (Environment-IL), and a simple yet effective approach called Confidence-Aware Moving Average (CAMA) that dynamically determines coefficients to update logits stored in memory based on model confidence scores, outperforming prior arts on the proposed benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing two incremental learning setups for interactive instruction following agents: Behavior Incremental Learning (Behavior-IL) to incrementally learn new behaviors, and Environment Incremental Learning (Environment-IL) to incrementally learn new environments.

2) Proposing a simple yet effective approach called Confidence-Aware Moving Average (CAMA) that dynamically determines coefficients to update logits stored in memory based on the agent's confidence scores. This helps prevent the logits from becoming outdated for more effective knowledge distillation.

3) Empirical evaluation showing that the proposed CAMA method outperforms comparable prior art continual learning methods by noticeable margins on the proposed Behavior-IL and Environment-IL setups.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing the two incremental learning setups for embodied agents, and the CAMA method to effectively leverage knowledge distillation for continual learning in these setups. The evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of CAMA over strong baselines.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called Confidence-Aware Moving Average (CAMA). Could you please explain in more detail how CAMA dynamically determines the coefficients for weighting the previous and current logits? How does it help mitigate catastrophic forgetting?

2. CAMA maintains queues to store the recent N confidence scores for each action and object class. How did the authors determine the optimal value of N? Did you experiment with different values of N and observe the impact? 

3. The paper compares CAMA against several strong baselines like CLIB, DER++, ER, EWC++ etc. Which baseline method does CAMA outperform by the biggest margin and why? What are the limitations of the other methods?

4. One of the benefits of CAMA is being task-free and not requiring explicit task boundaries. How exactly does CAMA achieve this? Why is being task-free important for real world applications?

5. The paper introduces two new continual learning setups - Behavior Incremental Learning and Environment Incremental Learning. Can you explain the key differences between the two setups? What kind of real world scenarios do they correspond to?  

6. For the Environment Incremental Learning setup, the paper balances the number of episodes across different environment types to avoid bias. Does a similar issue exist for the Behavior Incremental Learning setup? If so, how can it be addressed?

7. The qualitative analysis shows CAMA succeeding on tasks where baselines like Finetuning and DER++ fail. Can you analyze why the baselines fail in those examples and how CAMA is able to succeed?

8. One limitation mentioned is the inability to continually update the mask generators. What approaches could potentially be used to achieve that? Would simply applying CAMA to the mask generators also work?

9. The confidence scores are used as a proxy to determine the "quality" of the new logits. What other metrics could also be suitable for this purpose? Are there any scenarios where confidence scores may not accurately reflect logit quality? 

10. For future work, the limitations section mentions extending the method to handle blurry or overlapped tasks. What modifications would be needed in CAMA to make it suitable for such setups? How challenging do you expect that to be?
