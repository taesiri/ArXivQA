# [Self Supervised Correlation-based Permutations for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16383)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to integrate information from diverse views or modalities to obtain better clustering performance. Existing MVC methods have limitations such as being confined to specific domains, having suboptimal two-stage procedures for representation and clustering, and lacking end-to-end learning. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework called COPER for general MVC. The key ideas are:

1) Learn fused data representations using autoencoders equipped with a Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) objective. This captures shared information across views.

2) Introduce a multi-view pseudo-labeling scheme to identify cluster prototypes and reliable samples. This is used to supervise a clustering head that predicts assignments. 

3) Propose a novel self-supervised permutation task that randomly permutes within-cluster samples across views. This enhances intra-class variation and diminishes inter-class variation.

Main Contributions:

1) An end-to-end model for deep multi-view representation learning and clustering

2) A multi-view pseudo-labeling technique to obtain supervision  

3) A new permutation-based canonical correlation training procedure  

4) Empirical demonstration of state-of-the-art clustering accuracy on 10 benchmark datasets

5) Theoretical analysis showing the relation between the proposed technique and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

6) Quantification of the approximation error induced by inaccurate pseudo-labels 

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative deep learning framework for end-to-end multi-view clustering. By combining representation learning, pseudo-labeling, and novel canonical correlation permutations, the model is able to effectively fuse information across diverse data views and modalities for enhanced clustering.
