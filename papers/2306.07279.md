# [Scalable 3D Captioning with Pretrained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07279)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we efficiently generate high-quality descriptive captions for large-scale 3D object datasets like Objaverse? The key hypotheses are:1) Leveraging existing large-scale image-text models like BLIP2, CLIP, and GPT-4 that are pretrained on varied data can help generate better 3D object captions compared to using just one model or human annotation. 2) Consolidating information from multiple rendered views of a 3D object using these models can produce more comprehensive and accurate captions compared to using just a single view.3) The automated captions generated through this multi-model, multi-view approach can enable better fine-tuning of text-to-3D models compared to human-authored or metadata captions.4) This automated captioning pipeline is superior to human annotation in terms of cost, speed, and sometimes quality.The paper seems to validate these hypotheses through experiments on Objaverse and other datasets. The core contribution is developing and evaluating this automated captioning approach to enable large-scale high-quality 3D-text data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be the introduction of Cap3D, an automatic approach for generating descriptive text captions for 3D objects. The key ideas are:- Cap3D leverages pretrained models from image captioning, image-text alignment, and large language models (LLMs) to consolidate captions from multiple views of a 3D asset. This avoids the need for expensive manual annotation.- Cap3D is applied to the Objaverse dataset to gather 660k 3D-text pairs. It is also tested on a separate dataset called ABO to generate captions focusing on geometric structure.- The authors collect human evaluations and comparisons which demonstrate Cap3D captions are higher quality, lower cost, and faster than crowdsourced human captions.- Prompt engineering allows Cap3D to generate high-quality geometric captions rivaling humans on ABO.- Finetuning text-to-3D models like PointE and ShapeE on the Cap3D dataset leads to improved results compared to finetuning on human captions, demonstrating the value of Cap3D data.In summary, the main contribution appears to be the Cap3D method for automatically generating descriptive captions for 3D objects, along with human evaluations and applications demonstrating its advantages over manual annotation. The large-scale high-quality dataset produced is also an important contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces Cap3D, an automated approach for generating descriptive captions for 3D objects by leveraging pretrained image captioning, image-text alignment, and language models, and applies it to create a large-scale text-3D dataset, demonstrating superior performance over human annotations in quality, cost, and speed.
