# [New Intent Discovery with Attracting and Dispersing Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of new intent discovery (NID) in dialogue systems. NID aims to recognize known intent categories as well as discover new unseen intent categories, using limited labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data. However, existing methods fail to learn discriminative intent representations that have strong within-cluster compactness and large between-cluster separation. This makes it difficult to establish distinct boundaries between intent categories.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Robust and Adaptive Prototypical (RAP) learning framework to learn cluster-friendly intent representations. The key ideas are:

1) Robust Prototypical Attracting Learning (RPAL): Compels intent instances to gravitate tighter towards their corresponding class prototype to achieve greater within-cluster compactness. It uses an interpolation training strategy to make the method robust to label noise. 

2) Adaptive Prototypical Dispersing Learning (APDL): Maximizes the distance between prototypes to attain larger between-cluster separation. It uses an adaptive weighting scheme to impose larger penalties on nearer prototypes to push them further apart.

3) Joint optimization of RPAL and APDL to guide the model to learn representations with strong compactness and separation.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a prototype-guided learning framework to control within-cluster and between-cluster distances for cluster-friendly representations.
- Designs RPAL method to realize stronger within-cluster compactness while handling label noise.
- Devises APDL method to explicitly model between-cluster dispersion for better separation.  
- Achieves new SOTA results on 3 NID benchmarks, outperforming existing methods and even large LMs like ChatGPT by a large margin.
- Provides extensive analysis to demonstrate the model's ability to learn compact and well-separated intent clusters.
