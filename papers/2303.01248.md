# Can ChatGPT Assess Human Personalities? A General Evaluation Framework

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is:Can ChatGPT independently assess human personalities? More specifically, the paper explores whether ChatGPT, a large language model chatbot, can analyze and make judgements on human personality traits and types. The key goals appear to be:1) To propose a general evaluation framework that allows ChatGPT to conduct quantitative assessments of human personalities based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test. 2) To analyze if ChatGPT can reliably and fairly assess personalities of different groups of people.3) To compare ChatGPT's assessment abilities to other language models like InstructGPT. 4) To gain insights into ChatGPT's potential understanding of human psychology and reveal any biases it may have in assessing personalities.The central hypothesis seems to be that ChatGPT does have some capability to independently assess human personalities in a reasonably consistent and unbiased manner. The paper introduces techniques like subject-replaced queries and correctness-evaluated instructions to enable more flexible querying. The results suggest ChatGPT can assess personalities fairly consistently, though it is more sensitive to prompt wording compared to InstructGPT.In summary, the core research question is whether ChatGPT can serve as an independent tool to analyze and judge human personalities based on psychological tests like the MBTI. The paper aims to demonstrate and evaluate this potential for the first time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a general framework for evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to assess human personalities based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. This is the first work to explore whether LLMs can assess human personalities, opening up a new research direction of analyzing LLMs' perceptions of and abilities to judge human psychology.2. The paper proposes several techniques to create unbiased prompts and flexible queries that allow the LLM to provide more reliable and impartial personality assessments:- Unbiased prompts using randomly permuted options and averaged results over multiple testings. - Subject-replaced queries to flexibly assess different groups of people.- Correctness-evaluated instructions to obtain clearer responses from the LLM.3. Three quantitative evaluation metrics are introduced - consistency, robustness, and fairness scores - to measure the quality of the LLM's personality assessments.4. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT and InstructGPT to independently assess human personalities based on the framework. Results show ChatGPT can provide more consistent and fairer assessments than InstructGPT.In summary, the key contribution is devising a novel general framework to evaluate and quantify LLMs' ability to assess human personalities, which provides a new direction to analyze LLM psychology and human-likeness. The techniques and evaluation metrics proposed enable a more reliable personality analysis from LLMs.
