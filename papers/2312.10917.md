# [Semi-Supervised Clustering via Structural Entropy with Different   Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Semi-Supervised Clustering via Structural Entropy with Different Constraints":

Problem:
- Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique to group similar data points together. However, the clustering quality is often not satisfactory. 
- Semi-supervised clustering methods aim to improve clustering performance by incorporating human domain knowledge in the form of constraints. 
- Existing semi-supervised clustering methods either only work with one type of constraints or only perform partitioning clustering. There is a lack of methods that can handle different types of constraints and perform both partitioning and hierarchical clustering.

Proposed Method: 
- The authors propose a semi-supervised clustering method called SSE based on structural entropy. SSE can incorporate both pairwise constraints and label constraints. It can perform both partitioning clustering and hierarchical clustering.

- SSE constructs two graphs - data graph G from input data and relation graph G' from constraints. It uniformly represents different constraints as edge weights in G'.

- For partitioning clustering, SSE optimizes a 2D structural entropy objective using merging and moving operators. The objective adds a penalty term for violating constraints compared to unsupervised structural entropy.  

- For hierarchical clustering, SSE extends the 2D objective to high dimensions. It optimizes the objective using stretching and compressing operators to obtain a hierarchical tree structure.

Main Contributions:
- A uniform formulation to incorporate pairwise and label constraints for structural entropy based semi-supervised clustering
- A 2D structural entropy model for semi-supervised partitioning clustering, optimized by tailored merging and moving
- A high dimensional extension for semi-supervised hierarchical clustering, optimized by stretching and compressing
- Superior performance over 11 baseline methods on 9 datasets and ability to handle biological data

In summary, the paper proposes SSE, a structural entropy based semi-supervised clustering method that can handle different constraints and perform both partitioning and hierarchical clustering. Experiments show it outperforms existing methods.
