# [Boundary-Aware Value Function Generation for Safe Stochastic Motion   Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14956)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Navigation safety is critical for autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles operating in urban environments. It requires explicitly considering boundary constraints that describe borders of infeasible, non-navigable or unsafe regions. However, common value function approximation methods using neural networks or kernels cannot effectively characterize (and actually blur) the values at boundaries between navigable (safe) and non-navigable (unsafe) spaces. This may lead to collisions or getting stuck.

Solution:
The paper proposes a principled boundary-aware safe stochastic planning framework. The core idea is to generate a value function that can strictly distinguish state values between free (safe) and non-navigable (boundary) spaces in continuous state. This naturally leads to a safe boundary-aware policy.  

The solution integrates finite element methods (FEM) and kernel-based function approximation. FEM allows accurately characterizing safety-critical states' borders using compact support basis functions and imposing boundary conditions. The kernel-based function speeds up computation for non-safety-critical states.  

Specifically, the state space is divided into boundary-critical vs non-critical subspaces. FEM with mesh discretization and polynomial basis functions are used for boundary-critical subspace to impose safety constraints. Kernel functions with pre-sampled supporting states are used for non-critical subspace to enable efficient computation. The final value function approximation combines tensor product of the polynomial and kernel basis functions.

Contributions:

- A principled framework that generates boundary-aware value functions for safe planning under uncertainty by integrating FEM and kernels.

- Explicitly considers boundary constraints and distinguishes state values between safe and unsafe spaces through FEM, enabling safe policies.

- Alleviates heavy computation in FEM using meshless kernel-based approximation by decomposing state space into critical and non-critical subspaces.

- Demonstrated safe and efficient navigation in extensive simulations and real-world tests on ground vehicles under disturbances, validating the capability of generating strict boundary-aware policies.

To summarize, the key innovation is the synergistic combination of FEM and kernels to construct accurate and efficient value functions for safe planning, with rigorous evaluations on planning performance and navigation safety.
