# [Controlled Text Generation for Large Language Model with Dynamic   Attribute Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Controlling the attributes of text generated by large language models (LLMs) is challenging without compromising quality or fluency. Over-reliance on smaller models to steer LLMs' outputs can diminish both coherence and capabilities. 

Solution - Dynamic Attribute Graphs (DATG):
The paper proposes a flexible framework, DATG, to control text generation from LLMs using dynamic attribute graphs. 

Key steps:
1) Use LLM to generate text from prompt 
2) Score texts using attribute classifier 
3) Build weighted graphs linking tokens based on scores 
4) Identify key tokens influencing attribute via graph ranking 
5) Adjust logits and prompts to control occurrence of key tokens

This guides text within the semantic space towards desired attributes by manipulating a few key words only.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a pluggable DATG framework integrating dynamic attribute graphs with LLMs for controlled text generation
- Achieves substantial improvement in control accuracy (e.g. 19.29% over baselines) and text fluency
- Reintroduces graph models for controlled text generation, offering new insights into steering LLMs' outputs

The effectiveness of DATG is shown on toxicity mitigation and sentiment transformation tasks across multiple models, highlighting the potential of attribute graphs in adaptable and high-performing controlled generation systems.
