# CPED: A Large-Scale Chinese Personalized and Emotional Dialogue Dataset   for Conversational AI

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: How to develop a large-scale Chinese personalized and emotional dialogue dataset that can be used to train and evaluate conversational AI systems in their ability to understand and generate human-like conversations?The key points are:- Existing dialogue datasets for conversational AI largely ignore speaker personalities and emotions, or only consider some aspects of them. This makes it difficult for dialogue systems to truly understand speakers and generate human-like responses, even when using large pre-trained language models.- The authors propose creating a new dataset called CPED to address this limitation. CPED contains over 12K dialogues with multi-source knowledge related to empathy and personal characteristics, including gender, Big Five traits, emotions, dialogue acts, and conversation scenes.- CPED has rich annotations for personalities, emotions, and dialogue acts at both the speaker and utterance levels. This allows studying both dialogue understanding tasks like personality and emotion recognition, as well as generation tasks like personalized and emotional conversation.- The authors describe the dataset construction process in detail and provide baseline experiments for personality recognition, emotion recognition, and personalized emotional conversation generation tasks using CPED. The results demonstrate the value of the dataset.In summary, the central research question is how to construct a large-scale, richly annotated Chinese dialogue dataset that facilitates research into more human-like conversational AI systems that understand and express personality and emotion. CPED is proposed as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose a new dataset called CPED (Chinese Personalized and Emotional Dialogue dataset) for conversational AI research. This is a large-scale Chinese dialogue dataset annotated with speakers' personalities (gender, age, Big Five traits), emotions, dialogue acts, and conversation scenes. 2. CPED contains over 12K dialogues and 133K utterances extracted from 40 TV shows. It provides multimodal context including videos, audio clips, and textual transcripts. The authors release the textual data along with audio/video features.3. The paper defines three key tasks that can be studied using CPED: - Personality recognition in conversations (PRC): Recognizing speakers' personality traits from dialogues.- Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC): Identifying emotions from conversational context.- Personalized and emotional conversation (PEC): Generating human-like responses conditioned on personalities and emotions.4. Baseline experiments are provided for the three tasks to analyze the impact of leveraging personality and emotion information. Results show that explicitly modeling personalities and emotions helps generate more human-like responses compared to unconditioned models.5. The authors discuss potential applications of CPED in areas like empathetic conversation, mental health chatbots, multimodal emotion/personality recognition, etc.In summary, the key contribution is the new multimodal Chinese dataset CPED that enables personality and emotion-aware research for conversational AI. The tasks and baseline experiments demonstrate the value of modeling personalities and emotions for human-like dialog systems.
