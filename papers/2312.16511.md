# [S2M: Converting Single-Turn to Multi-Turn Datasets for Conversational   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational question answering (CQA) models have limited performance due to lack of large-scale annotated training data. 
- Existing single-turn QA datasets have not been fully exploited to improve CQA models. Directly using them causes a distribution shift issue.
- Existing CQA data augmentation methods have limitations in scale or quality.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel method to convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn CQA datasets.
- Three main components:
   - Single-Turn Candidate QA Pair Generator: Generates candidate QA pairs from contexts.
   - QA Pair Reassembler: Constructs a knowledge graph from the context and uses it to obtain coherent, sequential QA pairs.  
   - Question Rewriter: Rewrites context-independent questions into conversational ones.

Main Contributions:
- First work to successfully convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn CQA datasets. 
- Generated dataset called S2M, evaluated on QuAC benchmark. With S2M, model achieves new SOTA results on QuAC leaderboard.
- Human evaluation shows S2M has higher quality than other synthetic datasets in terms of answer accuracy, context relevance and overall adequacy.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective method to convert single-turn QA datasets to multi-turn CQA datasets to augment training data. Both automated and human evaluations demonstrate the high quality of the proposed S2M dataset. The model trained on S2M achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QuAC benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to convert single-turn question answering datasets to multi-turn conversational question answering datasets by generating candidate QA pairs, assembling them into conversations using a knowledge graph, and rewriting questions to be conversational.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors verify defects in directly using existing datasets for data augmentation in conversational question answering (CQA). Their results also indicate the possibility of converting single-turn to multi-turn datasets. As far as they know, this is the first work to successfully convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn datasets. 

2. They propose a new method to build a dataset called S2M for CQA. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the QuAC benchmark, where their method obtains state-of-the-art performance on the validation set and ranks 1st on the test set leaderboard.  

3. They conduct a human evaluation of the S2M dataset to show that the conversations in S2M are more adequate compared to other synthetic datasets in terms of answer accuracy, context relevance, and overall adequacy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel and effective method to convert single-turn QA datasets to multi-turn conversational QA datasets, as well as showing strong performance of models trained on the resulting S2M dataset.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel method to convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn datasets. Can you explain in detail the 3 key components of this proposed method - the QA pair Generator, QA pair Reassembler, and question Rewriter? What is the purpose and working of each?

2. The Knowledge Graph plays an important role in obtaining coherent sequential QA pairs. Can you explain how the Knowledge Graph is constructed from the context and the details of the Triples Join Algorithm? 

3. The paper introduces an Improved Union Search algorithm to deal with redundancy in the generated QA pairs. How does this algorithm work? What metrics are used to divide the QA pairs into different categories based on quality?

4. What is the R-CANARD dataset used for training the Conversational Question Rewriting (CQR) model? How is it different from the CANARD dataset? Explain the working of the CQR model.  

5. The paper conducts both unsupervised and supervised experiments on the QuAC dataset. What were the key findings? How does S2M dataset help in both settings?

6. How does the paper analyze the effectiveness of using existing single-turn vs multi-turn datasets for data augmentation? What results indicate that S2M is essential for the CQA task?

7. The human evaluation compares S2M with other datasets on 4 metrics. Can you explain what these metrics are and why S2M performs better on some metrics?

8. What modifications could be made to the Knowledge Graph construction procedure to make it more robust? How can the redundancy removal be improved?

9. The CQR model is currently trained on R-CANARD. What other conversational datasets could supplement it? Would generative models like BART help?

10. The paper focuses only on the span prediction task. How can the method be extended for free-form answer generation in CQA? What components would need to change?
