# [S2M: Converting Single-Turn to Multi-Turn Datasets for Conversational   Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational question answering (CQA) models have limited performance due to lack of large-scale annotated training data. 
- Existing single-turn QA datasets have not been fully exploited to improve CQA models. Directly using them causes a distribution shift issue.
- Existing CQA data augmentation methods have limitations in scale or quality.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel method to convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn CQA datasets.
- Three main components:
   - Single-Turn Candidate QA Pair Generator: Generates candidate QA pairs from contexts.
   - QA Pair Reassembler: Constructs a knowledge graph from the context and uses it to obtain coherent, sequential QA pairs.  
   - Question Rewriter: Rewrites context-independent questions into conversational ones.

Main Contributions:
- First work to successfully convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn CQA datasets. 
- Generated dataset called S2M, evaluated on QuAC benchmark. With S2M, model achieves new SOTA results on QuAC leaderboard.
- Human evaluation shows S2M has higher quality than other synthetic datasets in terms of answer accuracy, context relevance and overall adequacy.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective method to convert single-turn QA datasets to multi-turn CQA datasets to augment training data. Both automated and human evaluations demonstrate the high quality of the proposed S2M dataset. The model trained on S2M achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QuAC benchmark.
