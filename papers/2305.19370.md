# [Blockwise Parallel Transformer for Large Context Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19370)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we reduce the memory requirements of Transformers to enable training and evaluating them on much longer input sequences?The paper proposes a new method called Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) to address the memory limitations of standard Transformers. The key ideas are:- Compute self-attention in a blockwise manner to avoid materializing the full attention matrix. This reduces the quadratic memory cost of self-attention from O(n^2) to O(n). - Additionally compute the feedforward network blockwise together with attention, instead of waiting to compute it on the full sequence after attention is done. This significantly reduces the memory cost associated with the large feedforward network.- Overall, BPT computes self-attention and feedforward network in a fused, blockwise parallel manner. This enables much longer input sequences to be processed while maintaining efficiency.The central hypothesis is that blockwise parallel computation of self-attention and feedforward network can minimize the memory requirements of Transformers, allowing them to handle much longer sequences than previously possible. The paper evaluates this through extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks.In summary, the key research question is how to reduce Transformer memory costs to enable longer context training and evaluation, with the proposed BPT method that computes attention and feedforward network in a blockwise parallel fashion.

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we reduce the memory requirements of Transformer models to enable them to handle longer input sequences?The paper proposes a new approach called Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) to tackle the memory limitations of standard Transformer models. The key ideas are:- Computing self-attention in a blockwise manner without materializing the full attention matrix to reduce memory usage. - Additionally computing the feedforward network on a block-by-block basis together with attention, instead of waiting to process the entire sequence through the feedforward network after self-attention. This further reduces memory usage.- Overall, BPT processes longer input sequences while maintaining efficiency by fusing the blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network.The main hypothesis is that this blockwise parallel approach will enable Transformer models to handle much longer input sequences compared to standard Transformer architectures and previous memory-efficient methods. The experiments aim to validate whether BPT can actually support significantly longer context lengths during training.In summary, the paper introduces BPT to address the core research question of how to reduce Transformer memory costs to enable longer input sequences, with the central hypothesis that the proposed blockwise parallelization technique will achieve this goal. The experiments then seek to test this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a blockwise parallel computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion approach called Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) to reduce the memory requirements of Transformers. - Showing that BPT enables processing input sequences up to 32 times longer than vanilla Transformer models and up to 4 times longer than previous state-of-the-art memory efficient Transformers like FlashAttention.- Demonstrating the effectiveness of BPT through extensive experiments on language modeling using the OpenWebText dataset and reinforcement learning using the ExoRL benchmark.- For language modeling, BPT achieves high throughput and training speeds compared to baselines, being able to scale to very long context lengths of 131K tokens on a single GPU and 65K tokens on 8 GPUs.- For reinforcement learning, applying BPT allows conditioning on 32 trajectories instead of just 4, significantly boosting the performance of agentic transformers on all 6 RL tasks in ExoRL.In summary, the main contribution is proposing BPT, a novel blockwise parallel computation technique to reduce Transformer memory costs and enable much longer input sequence lengths, and showing its effectiveness on language modeling and RL tasks compared to prior work. The reduced memory requirements and ability to handle longer contexts could enable more complex models and advance research.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The key innovation of this paper is the proposed Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) approach for reducing memory costs in large Transformer models. This allows handling much longer input sequences than vanilla Transformers or prior work on memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention and Memory Efficient Attention. The core idea of computing self-attention and feedforward network in a fused blockwise manner is novel.- The paper clearly builds on prior work on memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention and Memory Efficient Attention by utilizing similar techniques like online softmax and blockwise attention. However, it makes the important observation that the feedforward network also needs to be computed blockwise to maximize memory savings. - There are other lines of research on efficient Transformers like sparse attention, low-rank factorization, mixture of experts etc. as discussed in the related work section. However, those rely on approximations while this paper focuses on exact blockwise computation to reduce memory. So the techniques are largely complementary.- For the application to RL with long context, this paper follows the general direction of prior work like Agentic Transformer that also conditions policy learning on multiple full trajectories. But it scales up the number of trajectories much more by leveraging BPT to handle the longer sequences.- Overall, the paper makes an important practical contribution by proposing a simple but impactful technique to reduce Transformer memory costs. The empirical results demonstrate clear benefits over strong baselines, and the method seems promising for enabling larger models and longer contexts. The writing quality is also solid.In summary, this paper has a novel technical contribution in BPT, compares favorably to related work, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The results are compelling and highlight the usefulness of the approach for scaling up Transformers.
