# [Blockwise Parallel Transformer for Large Context Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19370)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: 

How can we reduce the memory requirements of Transformers to enable training and evaluating them on much longer input sequences?

The paper proposes a new method called Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) to address the memory limitations of standard Transformers. The key ideas are:

- Compute self-attention in a blockwise manner to avoid materializing the full attention matrix. This reduces the quadratic memory cost of self-attention from O(n^2) to O(n). 

- Additionally compute the feedforward network blockwise together with attention, instead of waiting to compute it on the full sequence after attention is done. This significantly reduces the memory cost associated with the large feedforward network.

- Overall, BPT computes self-attention and feedforward network in a fused, blockwise parallel manner. This enables much longer input sequences to be processed while maintaining efficiency.

The central hypothesis is that blockwise parallel computation of self-attention and feedforward network can minimize the memory requirements of Transformers, allowing them to handle much longer sequences than previously possible. The paper evaluates this through extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks.

In summary, the key research question is how to reduce Transformer memory costs to enable longer context training and evaluation, with the proposed BPT method that computes attention and feedforward network in a blockwise parallel fashion.

How can we reduce the memory requirements of Transformer models to enable them to handle longer input sequences?

The paper proposes a new approach called Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) to tackle the memory limitations of standard Transformer models. The key ideas are:

- Computing self-attention in a blockwise manner without materializing the full attention matrix to reduce memory usage.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The key innovation of this paper is the proposed Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) approach for reducing memory costs in large Transformer models. This allows handling much longer input sequences than vanilla Transformers or prior work on memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention and Memory Efficient Attention. The core idea of computing self-attention and feedforward network in a fused blockwise manner is novel.

- The paper clearly builds on prior work on memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention and Memory Efficient Attention by utilizing similar techniques like online softmax and blockwise attention. However, it makes the important observation that the feedforward network also needs to be computed blockwise to maximize memory savings. 

- There are other lines of research on efficient Transformers like sparse attention, low-rank factorization, mixture of experts etc. as discussed in the related work section. However, those rely on approximations while this paper focuses on exact blockwise computation to reduce memory. So the techniques are largely complementary.

- For the application to RL with long context, this paper follows the general direction of prior work like Agentic Transformer that also conditions policy learning on multiple full trajectories. But it scales up the number of trajectories much more by leveraging BPT to handle the longer sequences.

- Overall, the paper makes an important practical contribution by proposing a simple but impactful technique to reduce Transformer memory costs. The empirical results demonstrate clear benefits over strong baselines, and the method seems promising for enabling larger models and longer contexts. The writing quality is also solid.

In summary, this paper has a novel technical contribution in BPT, compares favorably to related work, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The results are compelling and highlight the usefulness of the approach for scaling up Transformers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related work on memory-efficient Transformers:

- The proposed Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) method computes self-attention and feedforward network in a blockwise manner. This differs from methods like Sparse Transformers that rely on sparsifying attention. BPT computes exact full attention.

- BPT achieves substantially longer context lengths compared to prior arts - up to 32x longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4x longer than recent memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the blockwise design.

- The application of BPT to reinforcement learning with long input sequences is novel. It shows the usefulness of BPT in settings beyond language modeling that require conditioning on long history.

- BPT contrasts with model parallel approaches like Megatron that shard the model across devices. BPT operates on a per-device level to reduce memory. So BPT could be combined with model parallelism.

- The implementation and experiments focus on optimizing for and evaluating training sequence length, memory usage, and throughput. Comparatively, many recent works have focused more on evaluating model quality after training with limited context.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in achieving state-of-the-art memory reduction for Transformers while preserving full attention. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate these memory benefits translate to longer context lengths and greater scalability. The application to RL is also novel and impactful.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper proposes a Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) approach to reduce the memory requirements of standard Transformer models and enable training on much longer input sequences. The key idea is to compute self-attention and the feedforward network in a blockwise manner, rather than on the full input sequence. Specifically, the input is split into query blocks, key blocks, and value blocks.

The key idea is to compute self-attention and feedforward network in a blockwise manner instead of on the full sequence. Specifically, the input is split into query blocks and key-value blocks.

By computing attention and feedforward block by block in parallel, BPT minimizes memory usage and allows handling much longer sequences while maintaining efficiency. Experiments demonstrate BPT enables sequences 2-4x longer than prior memory-efficient Transformers and up to 32x longer than standard Transformers.
