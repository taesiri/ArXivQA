# [Blockwise Parallel Transformer for Large Context Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19370)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we reduce the memory requirements of Transformers to enable training and evaluating them on much longer input sequences?The paper proposes a new method called Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) to address the memory limitations of standard Transformers. The key ideas are:- Compute self-attention in a blockwise manner to avoid materializing the full attention matrix. This reduces the quadratic memory cost of self-attention from O(n^2) to O(n). - Additionally compute the feedforward network blockwise together with attention, instead of waiting to compute it on the full sequence after attention is done. This significantly reduces the memory cost associated with the large feedforward network.- Overall, BPT computes self-attention and feedforward network in a fused, blockwise parallel manner. This enables much longer input sequences to be processed while maintaining efficiency.The central hypothesis is that blockwise parallel computation of self-attention and feedforward network can minimize the memory requirements of Transformers, allowing them to handle much longer sequences than previously possible. The paper evaluates this through extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks.In summary, the key research question is how to reduce Transformer memory costs to enable longer context training and evaluation, with the proposed BPT method that computes attention and feedforward network in a blockwise parallel fashion.

The key ideas are:- Computing self-attention in a blockwise manner without materializing the full attention matrix to reduce memory usage. - Additionally computing the feedforward network on a block-by-block basis together with attention, instead of waiting to process the entire sequence through the feedforward network after self-attention. This further reduces memory usage.- Overall, BPT processes longer input sequences while maintaining efficiency by fusing the blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network.The main hypothesis is that this blockwise parallel approach will enable Transformer models to handle much longer input sequences compared to standard Transformer architectures and previous memory-efficient methods. The experiments aim to validate whether BPT can actually support significantly longer context lengths during training.In summary, the paper introduces BPT to address the core research question of how to reduce Transformer memory costs to enable longer input sequences, with the central hypothesis that the proposed blockwise parallelization technique will achieve this goal. The experiments then seek to test this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The key innovation of this paper is the proposed Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) approach for reducing memory costs in large Transformer models. This allows handling much longer input sequences than vanilla Transformers or prior work on memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention and Memory Efficient Attention. The core idea of computing self-attention and feedforward network in a fused blockwise manner is novel.- The paper clearly builds on prior work on memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention and Memory Efficient Attention by utilizing similar techniques like online softmax and blockwise attention. However, it makes the important observation that the feedforward network also needs to be computed blockwise to maximize memory savings. - There are other lines of research on efficient Transformers like sparse attention, low-rank factorization, mixture of experts etc. as discussed in the related work section. However, those rely on approximations while this paper focuses on exact blockwise computation to reduce memory. So the techniques are largely complementary.- For the application to RL with long context, this paper follows the general direction of prior work like Agentic Transformer that also conditions policy learning on multiple full trajectories. But it scales up the number of trajectories much more by leveraging BPT to handle the longer sequences.- Overall, the paper makes an important practical contribution by proposing a simple but impactful technique to reduce Transformer memory costs. The empirical results demonstrate clear benefits over strong baselines, and the method seems promising for enabling larger models and longer contexts. The writing quality is also solid.In summary, this paper has a novel technical contribution in BPT, compares favorably to related work, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The results are compelling and highlight the usefulness of the approach for scaling up Transformers.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related work on memory-efficient Transformers:- This paper focuses specifically on reducing the memory footprint of both the self-attention and feedforward network components of Transformers. Many prior works have focused only on approximating attention to reduce memory usage. - The proposed Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) method computes self-attention and feedforward network in a blockwise manner. This differs from methods like Sparse Transformers that rely on sparsifying attention. BPT computes exact full attention.- BPT achieves substantially longer context lengths compared to prior arts - up to 32x longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4x longer than recent memory-efficient Transformers like FlashAttention. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the blockwise design.- The application of BPT to reinforcement learning with long input sequences is novel. It shows the usefulness of BPT in settings beyond language modeling that require conditioning on long history.- BPT contrasts with model parallel approaches like Megatron that shard the model across devices. BPT operates on a per-device level to reduce memory. So BPT could be combined with model parallelism.- The implementation and experiments focus on optimizing for and evaluating training sequence length, memory usage, and throughput. Comparatively, many recent works have focused more on evaluating model quality after training with limited context.In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in achieving state-of-the-art memory reduction for Transformers while preserving full attention. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate these memory benefits translate to longer context lengths and greater scalability. The application to RL is also novel and impactful.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach called Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT) to reduce the memory requirements of Transformer models and enable training with longer input sequences. Transformers have become the backbone of many state-of-the-art natural language processing models, but their memory demands due to the self-attention and feedforward network limit their ability to handle long sequences. BPT computes self-attention and the feedforward network in a blockwise manner, where the input is split into blocks and blockwise attention and feedforward computations are performed iteratively. This fusion of feedforward network and self-attention blockwise computation minimizes memory usage and enables longer context lengths during training. Experiments demonstrate BPT can train sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods like FlashAttention and Memory Efficient Attention. The effectiveness of BPT is shown on language modeling using the OpenWebText dataset and on reinforcement learning using the ExoRL benchmark, where BPT improves performance by conditioning on more trajectories. Overall, BPT offers a practical approach to reduce memory requirements in Transformers and scale them to longer sequences.
