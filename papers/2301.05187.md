# [WIRE: Wavelet Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05187)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: 

Can a wavelet-based implicit neural representation (called WIRE) achieve state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks while overcoming limitations of previous implicit neural representations?

Specifically, the paper proposes using a complex Gabor wavelet activation function in an implicit neural network (MLP) to create the WIRE model. The key hypotheses are:

1) WIRE will have higher representation capacity than previous INRs thanks to the optimal time-frequency localization of wavelets for representing images. 

2) WIRE will learn faster than previous INRs due to wavelets' approximation properties.

3) WIRE will be more robust to noise, insufficient measurements, and other challenges compared to previous INRs which trade off accuracy for robustness. 

4) WIRE will achieve state-of-the-art results on a range of tasks including image representation, image processing, computed tomography, and novel view synthesis while overcoming limitations of previous INRs.

In summary, the main research question is whether a wavelet-based implicit neural representation can push INR performance to new levels across various vision tasks by leveraging the benefits of wavelets for image representation. The experiments aim to validate the superiority of WIRE across different applications and metrics.
