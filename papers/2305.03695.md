# [Vera: A General-Purpose Plausibility Estimation Model for Commonsense   Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03695)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to build a general-purpose commonsense statement verifier that can estimate the plausibility of natural language statements based on commonsense knowledge. The key hypothesis is that by finetuning a pretrained language model on a diverse collection of correct and incorrect commonsense statements sourced from knowledge bases and question answering datasets, it is possible to develop a model that can effectively judge the plausibility of novel commonsense statements across a wide range of domains and applications.In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates the VERA model, which is designed to output a plausibility score for any given commonsense statement based on the commonsense knowledge encoded in the model parameters. The paper hypothesizes that with an effective training strategy and data collection methodology, VERA will be able to reliably distinguish between true and false commonsense statements. The research questions explored are:1) Can a model finetuned on commonsense training data learn to effectively estimate the plausibility of novel commonsense statements?2) How does VERA compare to existing models and baselines when evaluated on commonsense QA datasets and knowledge filtering tasks?3) Does VERA generalize well to out-of-domain commonsense statements beyond its training data?4) Can VERA help detect commonsense mistakes made by other language models like ChatGPT?Through extensive experiments and analysis, the paper provides evidence that the proposed VERA model achieves state-of-the-art performance on commonsense plausibility estimation and outperforms existing methods, thus supporting the main hypothesis. Evaluating VERA in diverse settings also sheds light on the challenges and future work needed to develop robust verifiers.
