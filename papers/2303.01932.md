# [MobileBrick: Building LEGO for 3D Reconstruction on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01932)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we create a high-quality dataset with precise 3D ground truth shapes to support research on detailed 3D object reconstruction, especially using images captured on mobile devices?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question appear to be:

- Using LEGO models as the objects of interest. Since LEGOs have known geometry, this allows for accurate alignment of ground truth 3D models to captured image sequences.

- Designing a pipeline to accurately align the LEGO 3D models to the captured images sequences, involving keypoint annotation, manual refinement, and bundle adjustment.

- Capturing data on a mobile device (iPhone) to provide a unique modality of high-res RGB images along with low-res depth maps. 

- Creating a diverse dataset of 153 LEGO models with aligned ground truth 3D shapes.

- Demonstrating the value of the dataset on tasks like multi-view reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth map enhancement.

In summary, the core hypothesis seems to be that creating precise 3D ground truth shapes using LEGO models and capturing images on a mobile device will produce a valuable dataset to drive progress on high-quality 3D reconstruction for mobile AR/VR and related problems. The paper details the creation of such a dataset and validates its usefulness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing the MobileBrick dataset, which contains 153 Lego models with precise 3D ground truth shapes aligned to RGBD image sequences captured on a mobile device. 

2. Providing a method to accurately align the 3D Lego models to the image sequences using a combination of manual annotation, Perspective-n-Point (PnP) alignment, multi-view refinement, and bundle adjustment.

3. Demonstrating the usefulness of the dataset on three tasks - multi-view surface reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and color-guided depth enhancement. Experiments show the dataset can be used to train and evaluate various 3D reconstruction methods.

4. Introducing a "real-world model set" of Lego models based on real objects, as well as a procedurally generated "random model set" to provide a large amount of diverse training data.

5. Capturing a unique data modality - high resolution RGB with low resolution depth on a mobile device - which presents new challenges for 3D reconstruction algorithms.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of a novel dataset with precise 3D ground truth and a challenging mobile RGBD data modality, which can facilitate research on high-fidelity 3D reconstruction for mobile devices. The alignment method and experiments demonstrate its usefulness.
