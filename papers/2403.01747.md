# [Towards Self-Contained Answers: Entity-Based Answer Rewriting in   Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In conversational information seeking (CIS), answers returned by the system may contain entities that the user is unfamiliar with, impairing their ability to fully understand the answer. 
- Little attention has been paid to supporting users according to their knowledge level in CIS.

Proposed Solution: 
- Identify salient entities in CIS answers that are essential for understanding the answer. This was done by crowdsourcing annotations.
- Propose two strategies to rewrite answers to help user understanding:
   1) Expand answers by providing inline definitions of salient entities, making the answer self-contained. Two approaches explored: taking definitions from Wikibase or manual human-written descriptions blended into the answer text.
   2) Complement answers with follow-up questions, offering users the possibility to learn more about specific entities. Two types of follow-up questions analyzed: directly asking if they want definitions or politely offering definitions.

Key Contributions:
- Annotate a dataset of 360 CIS question-answer pairs to analyze entity salience. Find that majority of answers contain salient entities, indicating need for supporting user understanding.
- Propose two answer rewriting strategies: inline definitions and follow-up questions for definitions. Evaluate both strategies through crowdsourcing.
- Observe user preference for rewritten answers over original, especially with multiple salient entities defined inline. But high subjectivity in preferences.  
- Motivate future work on personalized answer rewriting based on analysis of justifications for chosen rewrite type.
- Experiment with large language models for rewriting but observe lack of control and faithfulness as limitations.

In summary, the key ideas are identifying salient entities that need definitions for understanding CIS answers, and rewriting answers to support users by either inline definitions or follow-up questions. The paper makes contributions in analyzing the problem space, proposing solutions, evaluating them, and providing insights to guide future research.
