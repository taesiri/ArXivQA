# [Towards Self-Contained Answers: Entity-Based Answer Rewriting in   Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01747)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In conversational information seeking (CIS), answers returned by the system may contain entities that the user is unfamiliar with, impairing their ability to fully understand the answer. 
- Little attention has been paid to supporting users according to their knowledge level in CIS.

Proposed Solution: 
- Identify salient entities in CIS answers that are essential for understanding the answer. This was done by crowdsourcing annotations.
- Propose two strategies to rewrite answers to help user understanding:
   1) Expand answers by providing inline definitions of salient entities, making the answer self-contained. Two approaches explored: taking definitions from Wikibase or manual human-written descriptions blended into the answer text.
   2) Complement answers with follow-up questions, offering users the possibility to learn more about specific entities. Two types of follow-up questions analyzed: directly asking if they want definitions or politely offering definitions.

Key Contributions:
- Annotate a dataset of 360 CIS question-answer pairs to analyze entity salience. Find that majority of answers contain salient entities, indicating need for supporting user understanding.
- Propose two answer rewriting strategies: inline definitions and follow-up questions for definitions. Evaluate both strategies through crowdsourcing.
- Observe user preference for rewritten answers over original, especially with multiple salient entities defined inline. But high subjectivity in preferences.  
- Motivate future work on personalized answer rewriting based on analysis of justifications for chosen rewrite type.
- Experiment with large language models for rewriting but observe lack of control and faithfulness as limitations.

In summary, the key ideas are identifying salient entities that need definitions for understanding CIS answers, and rewriting answers to support users by either inline definitions or follow-up questions. The paper makes contributions in analyzing the problem space, proposing solutions, evaluating them, and providing insights to guide future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper analyzes entity salience in conversational information seeking, proposes two strategies for answer rewriting to explain salient entities to users (inline definitions or follow-up prompts), and finds through evaluation that users generally prefer inline definitions over follow-up prompts, though preferences are subjective, highlighting the need for personalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Annotating a dataset of 360 question-answer pairs to characterize entity saliency in conversational information seeking. This analysis reveals that the majority of answers contain salient entities that are important for users to understand the answer.

2. Proposing and evaluating two methods for improving answers in conversational search: (a) rewriting the answer to expand it with inline definitions of salient entities, making the answer self-contained, and (b) prompting the user with a follow-up question to allow them to learn more about salient entities.  

3. Performing an extensive analysis of user feedback on the proposed answer rewriting strategies. This reveals clear preferences for rewritten answers over original ones, with inline definitions generally being favored over follow-up questions. However, high subjectivity is observed, motivating future personalization of answer rewriting.

4. Conducting an initial exploration of using large language models for end-to-end answer rewriting. The identified issues underscore the need for more controlled generation approaches as proposed in this paper.

The main contribution is proposing and evaluating methods for improving answers in conversational search based on identifying and explaining salient entities to users. The analysis provides insights into preferred rewrite formats while also revealing high subjectivity, providing a direction for future personalization research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Conversational information seeking (CIS)
- Entity salience 
- Entity linking
- Answer rewriting
- Inline entity definitions
- Follow-up prompts
- Mixed-initiative interactions
- User experience
- Personalization
- Crowdsourcing evaluation

The paper focuses on analyzing and utilizing entity salience to rewrite answers in conversational information seeking systems. It proposes and evaluates two main strategies - adding inline entity definitions to make answers self-contained, and offering follow-up prompts to let users learn more about entities. Key goals are improving user experience and understanding through answer rewriting. The methods are evaluated via crowdsourcing studies. Overall, the key theme is leveraging entities to enhance conversational search interactions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two main strategies for answer rewriting in conversational information seeking - inline entity definitions and follow-up prompts. Could you expand more on the motivations and hypothesized benefits behind each strategy? What are the potential limitations?

2. When providing inline definitions of salient entities, you experiment with extracting definitions from Wikibase versus manual rewriting by a human. What are some of the key differences you observed between these two approaches in practice? What are some ways the manual rewriting could be automated?

3. When evaluating user preferences between different answer rewrite formats, you find high subjectivity in people's choices. What are some ways you could personalize the type of rewrite provided based on individual user models and backgrounds?

4. The inter-annotator agreement for identifying salient entities is quite low in your analysis. What are some reasons for this subjectivity? How could the annotation task be improved to yield higher agreement while still capturing the nuanced notions of salience?  

5. You perform an initial experimentation with large language models for end-to-end answer rewriting. What are some of the main benefits and current limitations you observed? How do you see this space evolving in the near future?

6. You focus specifically on rewriting answers in a text-based conversational setting. Do you anticipate differences in a voice-only interface? What hypotheses would you have regarding user preferences in that setting?

7. The proposed evaluation is turn-by-turn versus assessing entire conversations. What are some ways you could design a more holistic, multi-turn study to analyze the long-term impact of answer rewriting strategies?

8. What role could user background knowledge play when selecting which entities to expand on and choosing the rewrite format? How would you go about building relevant user knowledge profiles?

9. One potential issue with entity-based rewriting is significantly lengthening the answer. What strategies do you propose for balancing conciseness versus completeness when expanding answers?

10. Beyond defining unknown entities, what are some other strategies you envision for improving understanding of system responses, e.g. simplifying complex terminology, paraphrasing difficult passages, etc.?
