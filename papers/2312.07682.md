# [An Online, Adaptive and Unsupervised Regression Framework with Drift   Detection for Label Scarcity Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07682)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In many real-world scenarios, obtaining labels or ground truth values for streaming data is challenging and impractical. Most adaptive regression models for streaming data assume labels are readily available, which is often not the case. This can lead to sub-optimal performance.
- There is a need for an adaptive regression technique that can operate effectively in label scarce contexts with streaming data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an online, adaptive, and unsupervised regression framework for streaming data with limited labels. 
- It initially trains two regression models on independent datasets - one model f on initial labeled data of size n and another model f' on size n'. This diversity helps adapt to changing data patterns.
- As new unlabeled data streams in, the models estimate ground truth and monitor for drifts using ADWIN detector. 
- On detecting drift, the model is promptly retrained to align with evolving data distribution.
- Predictions from the two models are combined to get a more robust estimate of ground truth value for the new unlabeled data.

Main Contributions:
- A novel unsupervised regression approach for streaming data using simple and explainable models.
- A drift detection mechanism combining ADWIN and RMSE error to enable dynamic model adaptations. 
- Evaluated proposed method on multiple public datasets and compared to non-adapting baselines.
- Show superior accuracy of proposed technique highlighting its potential for label scarce streaming contexts across various domains.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative streaming regression framework to effectively operate in practical scenarios where obtaining real-time labels is difficult. By leveraging initial labels, drift detection and continuous model adaptation, it provides more accurate predictions.
