# [Learning-Based Pricing and Matching for Two-Sided Queues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper considers a system with multiple types of customers and servers forming bipartite queues. Customers and servers arrive over time according to unknown demand/supply functions that depend on prices set by the platform.
- The platform matches compatible customer-server pairs, charges customers a price, and pays servers a price upon arrival. The goal is to set prices and match queues to maximize profit over a finite horizon while keeping all queue lengths below a threshold.

Main Challenges:
- Simultaneous learning and optimization with unknown demand/supply functions. 
- Trading off maximizing profit versus controlling queue lengths.
- Curse of dimensionality makes formulating as MDP intractable.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a learning-based pricing algorithm that combines stochastic gradient ascent with bisection search to simultaneously learn and set optimal prices.
- Establishes regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{5/6})$ compared to offline optimal solution.
- Provides queue length bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ to ensure stability.
- Derives tradeoff between better regret and lower queue lengths, ranging from $\tilde{O}(T^{5/6})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ queue length, to $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma/4})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$ queue length.
- Algorithm is model-free and achieves sublinear regret without knowing demand/supply functions.

To summarize, the paper provides an online learning pricing and matching algorithm for two-sided queues with theoretical performance guarantees in terms of profit regret and queue stability. The analysis quantifies the inherent tradeoff between profit maximization and queue length control.
