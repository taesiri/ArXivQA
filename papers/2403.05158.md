# [Adaptive Split Learning over Energy-Constrained Wireless Edge Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Split learning (SL) is a promising approach for training AI models in a distributed manner, where devices collaborate with a server to train a model based on a fixed split point. 
- However, due to device heterogeneity and varying channel conditions, using a static split point is not optimal in terms of training delay and energy consumption.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an adaptive split learning (ASL) scheme which can dynamically select split points for devices and allocate computing resources for the server to reduce training latency while satisfying an energy consumption constraint.

- An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average training latency subject to a long-term energy consumption constraint. 

- An online algorithm called OPEN is proposed to solve this problem using Lyapunov optimization. OPEN decomposes the long-term problem into a series of per-slot optimization problems using only current network information.

- A two-layer optimization method is then proposed to solve the per-slot mixed integer programming (MIP) problem - continuously optimizing the computing resource allocation for a given split point and then searching for the optimal split point.

Main Contributions:
- Design of an ASL scheme that addresses device heterogeneity and channel uncertainty to reduce model training delay

- Formulation of a joint optimization problem for split point selection and resource allocation under an energy consumption constraint  

- An online OPEN algorithm to transform the long-term problem into a per-slot MIP problem solvable with only current network information

- Extensive evaluations demonstrating significant reductions in average training delay (53.7%) and energy consumption (22.1%) compared to conventional SL schemes

In summary, the key innovation is the online and adaptive optimization of split points and resource allocation to minimize training latency of AI models in energy-constrained edge networks.
