# [Scalable AI Safety via Doubly-Efficient Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14125)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces the theoretical model of "doubly-efficient debate", where two polynomial-time AI debaters compete to convince a much more efficient verifier of the correctness of a computation that depends on access to human judgements modeled as a black-box oracle. The authors prove that, under certain assumptions, any polynomial-time computation can be verified using only a constant number of queries to the human judgement oracle and verifier time nearly linear in the input size. Specifically, they give protocols where the honest debater always has an efficient winning strategy, even against an unbounded dishonest debater. These theorems hold for both deterministic and stochastic models of human judgement. The results provide a theoretical foundation for using debate between AI systems judged by limited human feedback as a scalable approach to AI safety and oversight for increasingly complex tasks. A key requirement is that human raters could in principle carefully verify the full reasoning trace, even if the protocol only requires them to judge a small constant number of steps.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces the model of doubly-efficient debate for scalable AI safety by enabling the verification of complex AI systems using limited human feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing the theoretical model of "doubly-efficient debate", where two polynomial-time provers compete to convince a much more efficient verifier of the correctness of a computation that depends on access to black-box judgements representing human feedback. The paper proves theorems showing that, under certain assumptions, any polynomial-time computation can be verified using only a constant number of queries to the black-box judgement, and verifier time nearly linear in the problem size. This provides theoretical grounding for the idea of using debate between AI systems, with limited human feedback, as a mechanism for scalable oversight and safe training of powerful AI models. Specifically, it shows that even very complex model computations potentially describable over long natural language transcripts could be verified by only querying human judgements about a single step of the transcript.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Doubly-efficient debate - The main theoretical model introduced, where two polynomial-time provers compete to convince a much more efficient verifier of the correctness of a computation involving access to a black-box representing human judgements.

- Scalable oversight - The goal of designing protocols to provide high-quality feedback and oversight for training complex AI systems, while minimizing the amount of human feedback needed.

- Language models (LLMs) - The type of AI systems considered, which are trained on large amounts of text data and can generate or complete natural language.

- Interactive proofs - Theoretical results allowing efficient verification of powerful computations that the paper connects to for training LLMs. Concepts mentioned include IP = PSPACE, PCP theorem, and doubly-efficient interactive proofs.  

- Self-play - Training technique used in contexts like AlphaZero, connected in the paper to debate as a way to provide scalable oversight.

- Polynomial time - The computational constraint on the honest prover, requiring it to have an efficient strategy even against exponential time dishonest provers.

- Constant verifier queries - The theorem statements aim to verify computations with a number of verifier queries to the black box that does not grow with the computation length.

So in summary, the key themes are around using debate between AI systems, with limited human verification, in order to efficiently train powerful models that can solve problems requiring complex reasoning expressed in natural language.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the doubly-efficient debate method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper assumes the honest debaters can accurately simulate human judgments for any query. But real-world human judgments are complex and fuzzy. How can the framework be adapted if the honest debaters only have an approximate model of human judgments? 

2. The paper argues that doubly-efficient debate protocols can verify any polynomial-time computation using a constant number of queries to a human judge. But many real-world tasks require reasoning that may not have a clear polynomial-time verification procedure. How can the framework be extended to tasks without clear polynomial-time verifications?

3. The paper models human judgments as a black-box oracle. But real human feedback can be biased, inconsistent, or adversarial. How robust is the framework if the human judgment oracle makes random errors or gives adversarial responses? 

4. The completeness proofs require the honest debater to simulate the full computation faithfully. But errors could accumulate over a long simulation. How can the framework ensure the honest simulation does not diverge over time?

5. The soundness proofs require the dishonest debater's errors to be caught within a limited number of steps. But clever dishonest debaters may hide errors deeper in the simulation. Can the framework provide soundness against computationally unbounded dishonest debaters? 

6. The paper assumes debaters can produce extensive natural language justifications that humans could verify with enough thought. What happens if tasks are too complex for human verification no matter how much thought is applied?

7. Real-world tasks often require common sense reasoning not present in the formal framework. How can human common sense judgments be incorporated into the efficiency proofs?

8. The framework pits the debaters against each other in a zero-sum game. How sensitive are the results to potential collaboration or coordinated deception between debaters?

9. The completeness proofs require the verifier strategy to make the honest debater win the zero-sum game. What happens if the zero-sum assumption is violated or the payoffs are more complex?

10. The paper leaves open how to handle tasks without clear polynomial-length verifiable transcripts. What variants on the model could enable verification of implicit exponential length reasoning traces?
