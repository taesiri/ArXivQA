# [RATSF: Empowering Customer Service Volume Management through   Retrieval-Augmented Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04180)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately forecasting customer service volume is critical for efficient management in industries like travel. However, existing RNN and Transformer models struggle to effectively utilize historical data to handle non-stationary time series. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the RATSF (Retrieval-Augmented Time Series Forecasting) framework to address this challenge. RATSF has 3 key components:

1) RACA (Retrieval-Augmented Cross Attention) module - Integrates relevant historical segments into the Transformer decoder using cross-attention to augment forecasting.

2) Time Series Knowledge Base (TSKB) - Efficiently stores and indexes historical time series data to enable precise retrieval of relevant segments. Uses a dual KV schema.  

3) Predictive embedding - Learns an effective embedding using the forecast model's encoder to retrieve relevant historical sequences. Starts with DTW retrieval and transitions.

Main Contributions:

1) General retrieval-augmented framework for time series forecasting that can enhance various Transformer models.

2) Novel RACA module design that leverages cross-attention to integrate historical data.

3) TSKB storage schema enabling flexible retrieval of variable length historical segments.  

4) Embedding technique using forecast model's encoder to improve retrieval accuracy.

5) Significantly boosts performance across domains (e.g. 18% MAE reduction on hotel service volume data).

The proposed RATSF framework provides an efficient way to utilize historical data to tackle complex non-stationary time series forecasting across application scenarios. The RACA module and TSKB storage design are key innovations enabling flexible integration of relevant context.
