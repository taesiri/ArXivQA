# [Error Discovery by Clustering Influence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the slice discovery problem, which is the task of partitioning a dataset based on model performance in order to identify groups (slices) where the model underperforms. Two key challenges in developing a slice discovery method (SDM) are: (1) formalizing the coherence property - requiring that errors within a slice have the same underlying root cause, and (2) identifying a useful representation of the data to enable discovering coherent, underperforming slices.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new SDM called InfEmbed, which uses influence functions to define coherence and derives a representation called influence embeddings to enable discovering coherent slices. 

Specifically, the coherence property is formalized using influence functions, which estimate the effect of a training example on a test example's loss. The influence explanation of a test example is defined as the vector of influence scores of all training examples on that test point. Coherent slices are then defined as slices where examples have similar influence explanations.  

To enable clustering test examples based on their influence explanations, the paper introduces influence embeddings - lower-dimensional approximations of influence explanations that satisfy a dot product property. By clustering influence embeddings, examples with similar influence explanations will be grouped into slices.

The proposed InfEmbed method simply applies K-means clustering on influence embeddings of test examples to discover coherent and problematic slices. An extension, InfEmbed-Rule, recursively partitions the data to find large, low-performing slices based on user-defined rules.

Main Contributions:

- Formalizes the coherence property for slice discovery using influence functions 

- Introduces influence embeddings to reduce dimensionality of influence explanations while preserving similarity

- Proposes InfEmbed method to discover problematic, coherent slices by clustering influence embeddings

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on slice discovery benchmarks

- Shows InfEmbed can identify known model errors and provides interpretable explanations via influence-based slice opponents

- Derives desirable properties like label homogeniety that explicitly incorporating influence functions confers

In summary, the key innovation is the use of influence functions to formally define slice coherence and derive an influence-based representation to enable discovering coherent, problematic slices. Both quantitative experiments and case studies demonstrate InfEmbed's effectiveness.
