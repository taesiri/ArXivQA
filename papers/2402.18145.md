# [Learning Intrinsic Dimension via Information Bottleneck for Explainable   Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Gradient-based explanation methods are widely used to interpret neural models in NLP by determining word-level importance based on gradient values. 
- These methods presume equal significance for all gradient dimensions. 
- However, in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), preliminary research suggests that only specific dimensions are pertinent for the task.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes an Information Bottleneck-based Gradient (IBG) explanation framework to learn the intrinsic dimension for ABSA models.
- It introduces an Information Bottleneck-based Intrinsic Learning (iBiL) structure to distill word embeddings into a low-dimensional, concise representation that retains essential sentiment features while omitting unrelated information.
- This intrinsic representation is combined with the original embedding and input to the encoder. Gradients from both original and intrinsic embeddings are used to determine word importance scores.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel IBG framework to learn an intrinsic dimension for improving ABSA model interpretation.
- Introduces a new iBiL structure based on information bottleneck to obtain intrinsic embeddings.
- Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate IBG enhances both model performance and interpretability.
- Ablations validate the impact of iBiL structure and benefits of learning via intrinsic dimensionality.
- The model-agnostic IBG framework is shown to provide strong improvements when integrated with state-of-the-art ABSA models.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage information bottleneck for obtaining intrinsic embeddings tailored to ABSA task, such that gradients from this intrinsic space can better highlight sentiment-specific explanations for model interpretations. Evaluations verify the efficacy of this idea and the overall IBG framework.
