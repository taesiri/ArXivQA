# [Inconsistent dialogue responses and how to recover from them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10353)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational AI systems often generate inconsistent responses that contradict their previous statements or external facts. This causes confusion and reduces reliability.
- Two main types of inconsistencies studied: extrinsic (conflicts with external facts) and intrinsic (self-contradictions). The paper focuses on intrinsic history contradictions between an AI's statements.  
- Existing methods try to prevent inconsistencies during model training/decoding. But they cannot resolve inconsistencies once they occur, e.g. from user input.

Proposed Solution:
- New dataset called CIDER with 27,180 dialogues for researching inconsistency introduction, understanding, and resolution.
- Annotators introduce inconsistencies byauthoring alternate dialogue turns that contradict previous statements.
- They also write natural language explanations of the inconsistencies and resolving responses to continue the dialogue. 
- Comprehensive experiments using CIDER to train inconsistency checkers and resolvers. Assess performance of supervised models vs LLMs like ChatGPT.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset covering full lifespan of conversational inconsistencies - introduction, explanation, resolution
- Shows CIDER significantly improves performance of inconsistency detection and resolution models
- Analysis indicates LLMs can effectively resolve inconsistencies when prompted, but still struggle to independently detect them
- Findings underscore need for better methods to identify contradictory dialogue, while showing promise of LLMs for clarification generation

In summary, the paper introduces a valuable resource to research the persistent challenge of contradictory dialogue responses in conversational AI systems. Experiments demonstrate current progress and limitations in robustly handling these inconsistencies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a dataset called CIDER with over 27,000 annotated dialogues to study the introduction, understanding, and resolution of inconsistencies in conversations, and shows it can significantly advance the detection and resolution of such inconsistencies, though large language models still struggle with identifying them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new dataset called CIDER to study inconsistencies in dialogues. Specifically:

1) The CIDER dataset contains over 27,000 annotated dialogues covering the introduction, understanding, and resolution of inconsistencies. For each dialogue, annotators wrote an inconsistent continuation utterance, an explanation of why it is inconsistent, and a clarifying response to resolve the inconsistency. 

2) The paper shows that models trained on CIDER significantly outperform models trained on other datasets in detecting and resolving conversational inconsistencies. This demonstrates CIDER's value in advancing research on consistency in dialogues.

3) The paper conducts comprehensive experiments analyzing the ability of large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 to identify and resolve inconsistencies. The findings indicate these models excel at resolving inconsistencies but still struggle to reliably detect them.

In summary, the key contribution is the new CIDER dataset to drive progress in understanding and handling inconsistencies in conversational AI through its annotation of inconsistent utterances and paired clarifying responses across thousands of dialogues.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Inconsistencies in dialogue systems
- Conversational contradiction detection 
- Dialogue consistency checking
- Dialogue consistency resolution
- Clarification responses
- Conversational inconsistencies dataset (CIDER)
- Natural language inference (NLI)
- Large language models (LLMs)
- ChatGPT
- GPT-4

The paper introduces a new dataset called CIDER to study inconsistencies in dialogues. It covers the introduction, understanding, and resolution of such inconsistencies. Experiments are conducted on consistency checking and resolving using this dataset. The performance of large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 on these tasks is also analyzed. So the key focus is on assessing and addressing contradictions in dialogues using the proposed dataset.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called CIDER for studying conversational inconsistencies. What are the key components of the CIDER dataset and how do they capture the lifecycle of inconsistencies (introduction, understanding, resolution)?

2. The paper evaluates consistency checkers trained on CIDER and other datasets. What are the key findings in terms of CIDER's ability to provide useful supervision for detecting inconsistencies compared to other datasets? 

3. The paper examines two settings for the consistency checking task - pairwise checking and dialog-level checking. What are the differences in performance of the checkers under these two settings? What does this suggest about the difficulty of contextual inconsistency detection?

4. The paper shows that incorporating additional datasets like CDConv, OCNLI and STANCE improves CIDER-trained checkers. What approaches work best for leveraging this additional data and why?

5. How do the large language models, ChatGPT and GPT4, perform as consistency checkers compared to the supervised models? What does this suggest about their current capabilities and limitations?

6. For the consistency resolution task, what are the differences in performance between the pairwise and dialog-level settings? What factors make dialog-level resolution more challenging? 

7. How does providing gold explanations help the T5 and BART resolvers generate better clarification responses? What does this suggest about the importance of explaining inconsistencies?

8. What are the major types of errors made by the BART resolver, even with access to gold explanations? How might these failures be addressed?

9. The paper finds that while LLMs generate lower scoring clarification responses, they are better at actually resolving inconsistencies. Why this discrepancy between automatic and human evaluation?

10. What are limitations of the current work, especially in terms of coverage of inconsistency types and evaluating the end-to-end ability of models to detect and resolve inconsistencies?
