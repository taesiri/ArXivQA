# [Enhancing Data Quality in Federated Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04529)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Foundation models (LLMs with >1B parameters) rely heavily on public domain data, which is nearing exhaustion. To continue scaling up LLMs, it is crucial to incorporate high-quality private domain data from multiple specialized sources. 
- However, directly sharing private data presents privacy issues. Federated learning allows collaborative training without sharing raw private data, but brings data quality control challenges.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an automated data quality control pipeline for federated fine-tuning of foundation models. 
- In Phase 1, each client computes quality scores for its local data using validation set and scoring functions like perplexity, conditional probability, or influence functions.
- The server sets a global score threshold using a minimal "anchor" dataset to determine a unified quality standard. 
- In Phase 2, clients filter their local dataset to only high-quality samples above the threshold and conduct federated learning.

Key Contributions:
- Automated scoring functions to evaluate individual sample quality in a federated setting.
- Global threshold from anchor set to address heterogeneity in data quality across different clients.  
- Experiments show the pipeline enhances effectiveness and reliability of federated model training, improving performance metrics like GPT-4 scoring, OpenAssistant, and knowledge benchmark accuracy.
- Opens possibilities for continued foundation model scaling by collaborating private domain data sources in light of public data exhaustion.

In summary, the key innovation is an automated data quality control pipeline that enables multiple data sources to collaboratively train foundation models in a federated manner, while preserving data privacy and ensuring only high-quality data is utilized. This facilitates larger and more capable foundation models.
