# [Leveraging Large Language Models for NLG Evaluation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Leveraging Large Language Models for NLG Evaluation: A Survey":

Problem: 
Traditional NLG evaluation methods like BLEU and ROUGE have limitations in assessing key quality aspects of generated text like coherence and relevance. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) open new possibilities for NLG evaluation owing to their capabilities in context comprehension, reasoning, and generation. However, existing works on utilizing LLMs for NLG evaluation lack a structured taxonomy and comparative analysis. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides the first comprehensive survey categorizing existing works on LLM-based NLG evaluation. It proposes a taxonomy organizing relevant literature along three dimensions - evaluation task, evaluation references, and evaluation function. Based on the evaluation function, methods are classified into prompt-based evaluation and tuning-based evaluation. These categories are further divided into subtypes like score-based, probability-based, Likert-scale, pairwise comparison, ensemble models, and advanced evaluation protocols. The paper delves into a detailed exploration of the methodologies, strengths, and limitations of works within each category.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes a formal framework and coherent taxonomy to categorize LLM-based NLG evaluation
- Provides an in-depth analysis of various generative evaluation methods based on LLMs 
- Summarizes prevalent meta-evaluation benchmarks and datasets for validating LLM-based evaluators
- Discusses open challenges regarding bias, robustness, domain-specificity and need for unified evaluation
- Advocates developing more impartial, robust and expert LLM-based evaluators integrated with other assessment methods

In summary, this is the first systematic survey offering structural organization, critical analysis and discussion of open problems related to an emerging area - utilizing LLMs for evaluating NLG systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a taxonomy to categorize LLM-based NLG evaluation methods into prompt-based and tuning-based. What are the key differences between these two categories? What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach?

2. The paper discusses various scoring protocols used in LLM-based evaluation, including score-based, probability-based, Likert-scale, pairwise comparison, and ensemble methods. Can you explain these different protocols and discuss situations where one protocol may be more suitable than others? 

3. The paper highlights advanced LLM-based evaluation techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting, in-context learning, and error-oriented analysis. How do these techniques allow for more nuanced and comprehensive evaluations compared to simpler approaches? What are some limitations?

4. The paper argues that relying too heavily on powerful generative models like GPT-4 for evaluation leads to biases and unfair assessments. What is the “chicken-and-egg” dilemma discussed here regarding evaluators and generators? How can this be addressed?

5. Considering domain-specific knowledge is important for accurate NLG evaluation in specialized fields like law, medicine etc. What are some ways LLM-based evaluators can be adapted to different domains? What challenges need to be overcome?

6. The robustness of LLM-based evaluators against misleading or adversarial inputs is highlighted as an issue. What are some examples of robustness issues discussed? How can evaluators be made more resilient? 

7. What are some real-world scenarios requiring more flexible and unified NLG evaluation discussed in the paper? What attempts have been made towards developing such generalized evaluation protocols?

8. The paper argues both intrinsic biases (e.g. social biases) within LLMs and biases specific to the evaluator role need calibrating. Can you expand more on the latter and provide some examples of evaluator-specific biases?

9. Can you discuss some of the major NLG tasks covered in the paper like machine translation, text summarization etc. and associated meta-evaluation benchmarks used to validate LLM-based evaluators?

10. What are some promising future directions and open challenges in leveraging LLMs for NLG evaluation highlighted in the paper? Which of these directions seem most impactful to explore further?
