# [Augmented Language Models: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07842)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can language models be augmented with reasoning abilities and the capability to use tools in order to improve their performance on complex language understanding and reasoning tasks? 

The authors review recent works that aim to enhance language models by equipping them with reasoning skills (e.g. via prompting the model to show its reasoning step-by-step) and tools (e.g. access to search engines, calculators, etc). They introduce the concept of "Augmented Language Models" (ALMs) to refer to language models that leverage such augmentations, and map out the landscape of existing approaches according to axes like how reasoning and tools are implemented (heuristics vs learned) and whether they focus more on reasoning or acting skills. 

The overarching hypothesis seems to be that augmenting language models in these ways will allow them to solve a broader range of complex tasks that require combining reasoning, knowledge, and action, while retaining strong language modeling capabilities. The authors conclude that this is a promising research direction to overcome limitations like brittleness, lack of interpretability, and need for massive scale in current LLMs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of recent work on augmenting language models with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The paper categorizes these "augmented language models" (ALMs) along three main dimensions: reasoning abilities, use of tools/acting, and how these skills are acquired (e.g. via heuristics, supervision, or reinforcement).

2. It proposes definitions for key terms like "reasoning", "tool", and "act" in the context of ALMs. Reasoning is defined as decomposing complex tasks into simpler subtasks. Tools refer to external modules that can be called by the LM to augment its context. Acting refers to tools that allow the LM to take actions and have effects on the virtual or physical world.

3. The paper argues that equipping LMs with reasoning and tools moves beyond pure language modeling, as the models are no longer just predicting the next token based on a fixed-length context window. Instead, ALMs can expand their context in more flexible ways before generating outputs.

4. It highlights the potential benefits of ALMs compared to traditional LMs, in terms of truthfulness, uncertainty estimation, interpretability, and enhanced capabilities by leveraging reasoning and diverse tools. But it also notes ethical concerns related to credibility and potential harms if actions are taken without human oversight.

5. The survey aggregates results across a wide variety of recent papers at the intersection of language models, reasoning, and tool use. This provides a unified lens on an emerging research area and can inform future work on developing more capable and safer ALMs.

In summary, the key contribution is providing a structured overview of the growing literature on augmented language models, along with analysis of their potential benefits and limitations compared to standard language models. The paper helps carve out ALMs as a distinct research direction Going beyond pure language modeling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary: 

The paper surveys recent work on augmenting language models with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools, departing from the standard language modeling paradigm.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a critical analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field:

The paper presents a survey of recent work on augmenting language models with reasoning skills and the ability to use external tools. It focuses on two main axes - improving reasoning abilities through techniques like prompting and teaching language models to act in the real world by interfacing with tools. 

The survey provides a broad overview of many recent papers in this emerging field. However, there are a few other surveys and analyses that cover related topics:

- Huang et al. (2022) provide a more in-depth look specifically at reasoning in language models, including methods like prompting and chain-of-thought. Their survey goes deeper into the different types of reasoning evaluated. The current survey has a broader scope by also reviewing acting through tools.

- Qiao et al. (2022) also focus solely on reasoning, but specifically via prompting techniques. They categorize and analyze different prompting methods for reasoning. The current survey covers prompting more briefly and combines it with tool use.

- Borgeaud et al. (2022) focus specifically on memory augmented neural networks for language tasks. They review different memory architectures like pointers and sparse access. The current survey looks more broadly at reasoning and tools.

- Nakano et al. (2022) provide a landscape of semantic parsers, reviewing both classic statistical approaches and more recent neural models. The current survey touches on semantic parsing for reasoning but does not go into the same depth.

Overall, this survey provides good breadth across reasoning methods and tool use for language models. But other surveys drill deeper into specific subareas like prompting, memory architectures, and semantic parsing. The categorization into reasoning, tools, and learning is effective for grouping the wide range of approaches discussed. One limitation is that reinforcement learning methods are covered relatively briefly compared to their importance in tool use. But overall, this survey nicely complements more specialized surveys by providing a broad overview of augmentation techniques for language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing better offline RL algorithms to teach language models to reason and act, as current RL methods still suffer from instability issues. Offline RL could combine the flexibility of RL with the stability and data efficiency of supervised learning.

- Studying how bootstrapping approaches like the one proposed in the paper could be extended to more complex multi-step tool uses. The current method samples tool uses independently, but coordinating multiple tools is an important direction.

- Investigating self-supervised approaches to teach language models when to use different tools, rather than relying solely on human demonstrations. For example, the paper mentions an idea of using the model's own generations to provide training signal.

- Exploring the interaction between reasoning skills and tool use within the same model. Most works focus on either reasoning or tools separately. Combining both could lead to more capable agents.

- Developing models that can decide when to rely on their own knowledge versus when to query external tools. There is a tradeoff between memorization and tool use that models may need to learn to balance.

- Considering other modalities beyond text (e.g. vision, audio) to provide additional context. Multimodal information could improve reasoning and acting abilities.

- Studying whether smaller models augmented with tools can attain capabilities of larger standalone models, as a way to improve scaling. Tool use provides a path towards more efficient models.

- Investigating whether tool use leads to more truthful, uncertain, interpretable and capable models compared to traditional LMs. The authors posit advantages but rigorous analysis is needed.

- Addressing ethical concerns around reliability and potential for harm as LMs are given increased reasoning and acting abilities.

In summary, key directions are improving learning algorithms, studying reasoning-tool synergies, scaling benefits, systematic empirical analysis, and ethics. The paper lays out an exciting research agenda around augmented language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Augmented Language Models (ALMs) as a promising way to address limitations of traditional language models (LMs) such as lack of interpretability, susceptibility to factual errors, and need for massive scale. ALMs incorporate external modules for reasoning, tool use, and acting to expand the contextual processing abilities of LMs while retaining the standard next-token prediction objective. The paper surveys recent works augmenting LMs with skills like recursive prompting, tool use (information retrieval, calculators, search engines, etc), and embodiment (controlling virtual agents or robots). It finds most approaches rely on heuristics or human supervision, presenting opportunities for more self-supervised methods. Overall, ALMs offer potential benefits like truthfulness, uncertainty estimation, interpretability, and enhanced capabilities, balancing language modeling with external grounding. The paper concludes ALMs are an exciting path towards next-generation deep learning systems capable of complex interaction.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper is a survey on augmenting language models with reasoning skills and the ability to interact with tools. The first main section reviews works on improving the reasoning abilities of language models, such as through prompting techniques like chain-of-thought that encourage the model to show its reasoning steps. Other methods include recursive prompting to break down problems into sub-problems, and explicitly training models on reasoning tasks. The second main section looks at works on allowing language models to leverage tools, ranging from calling other neural networks or the language model itself, to information retrieval systems, code interpreters, search engines, web browsers, and even physical robot control. The survey categorizes approaches based on whether reasoning skills and tool use are implemented via heuristics or learned. 

Overall, the paper argues that augmenting language models in these ways addresses some limitations of traditional language models. Reasoning skills and tool use can make models more truthful, reduce uncertainty, enhance capabilities and interpretability, and potentially lead towards more general artificial intelligence. The authors refer to augmented language models as "ALMs" to distinguish them from standard language modeling. However, challenges remain in effectively teaching models to reason and use tools in a scalable self-supervised fashion. Combining reasoning, tool use, and language modeling in a mutually beneficial way is an interesting direction for future work on advanced language-based AI systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for augmenting language models with reasoning skills by having them explicitly demonstrate intermediate reasoning steps. Specifically, the method trains the language model using "chain of thought" examples, where the input is followed by a step-by-step breakdown showing how to arrive at the output. For instance, a math word problem would be followed by mathematical reasoning steps to deduce the solution. The language model is trained or prompted to mimic this reasoning process on new examples, producing intermediate steps leading to the final output. By training the model to reason explicitly in this way, the authors show it is better able to solve complex reasoning tasks than language models without this augmentation. The key aspects are the chain of thought training data, and the elicitation at test time of step-by-step reasoning from the model.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, this paper appears to be a survey reviewing recent works on augmenting language models (LMs) with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The key problem it is addressing is the limitations of current large language models, including issues like factual inaccuracies, lack of interpretability, and the need for massive scale to attain certain capabilities. 

The authors argue these issues arise partly due to LMs only having access to a limited context during training and inference. To address this, recent works have proposed augmenting LMs in two main ways:

1) Improving reasoning skills: Allowing LMs to break down complex tasks into simpler subtasks or reasoning steps before generating a final output. This is done using approaches like prompting the LM to show its "chain of thought".

2) Allowing LMs to use tools: Letting LMs call external modules like search engines or calculators to gather additional knowledge not present in the LM's parameters. 

The authors refer to models augmented in these ways as "Augmented Language Models" (ALMs) and survey the literature on how ALMs aim to alleviate issues like lack of interpretability, need for massive scale, and factual consistency faced by standard LMs. The survey focuses on categorizing approaches based on whether they improve reasoning, tool use, or both.

In summary, the key problem is overcoming limitations of current LMs by augmenting them with reasoning and tool use abilities, and the survey aims to provide a structured overview of existing work in this emerging area. The authors believe studying ALMs could lead to more capable and useful language-based AI systems.
