# [Prompting Is All You Need: Automated Android Bug Replay with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01987)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can large language models be effectively leveraged for automated bug replay through prompt engineering?More specifically, the paper proposes an approach called AdbGPT that aims to automatically reproduce bugs from bug reports using large language models via prompt engineering, without requiring any training data or hard-coding. The key ideas are:1) Using prompt engineering with few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to elicit knowledge from large language models to extract step-to-reproduce (S2R) entities from bug reports.2) Encoding the GUI state into a prompt that the language model can process in order to dynamically guide the bug reproduction on the device. The central hypothesis appears to be that large language models can be prompted to perform natural language understanding and logical reasoning needed for bug report comprehension and replay in a similar manner to how a developer would approach the task. The experiments aim to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and usefulness of this approach.In summary, the main research question is whether prompt engineering of large language models can enable automated bug reproduction from bug reports without traditional training or hard-coding, and the paper presents and evaluates the AdbGPT approach for addressing this question.
