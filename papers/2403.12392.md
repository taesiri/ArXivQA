# [AraPoemBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Arabic Poetry Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Arabic poetry has rich linguistic features and cultural significance, requiring advanced computational models for analysis. Prior work has limitations in accuracy and scope for poetry analysis tasks.  

Proposed Solution
- The paper proposes AraPoemBERT, a new BERT-based language model pretrained from scratch exclusively on 2.09 million verses of Arabic poetry text.  

Key Contributions
- AraPoemBERT outperforms 5 other Arabic language models (including AraBERT, CAMeLBERT) on poetry analysis tasks attaining state-of-the-art results.
- The tasks include: sentiment analysis (78.95% accuracy), meter classification (99.03% classical, 97.82% all), sub-meter classification (97.79% accuracy), poet gender classification (99.34%), and rhyme detection (97.73%).
- Explores 3 new tasks not addressed previously - sub-meter, gender, rhyme classification. Previous works focused only on meter classification and sentiment analysis.
- Compiles a new large-scale Arabic poetry dataset of 2.09 million verses labeled with meter, sub-meter, rhyme, poet, topic etc. 
- Demonstrates the significance of domain-specific language models like AraPoemBERT pretrained exclusively on poetry text, compared to general Arabic language models.
- AraPoemBERT and the new dataset will serve as valuable resources for future Arabic NLP research in linguistics, literature, and cultural studies.

In summary, the paper presents AraPoemBERT, a novel BERT-based model for Arabic poetry analysis which achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks compared to prior art. The model and dataset will enable more advanced poetry analysis research.
