# [On the Tool Manipulation Capability of Open-source Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16504)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can we enhance open-source large language models to be competitive with leading closed API services for software tool manipulation, using only a practical amount of human supervision?The key aspects are:- Focusing on open-source large language models (LLMs) rather than proprietary or closed models.- Aiming to make these open-source LLMs competitive with the leading proprietary models like GPT-4 for tool manipulation tasks. - Wanting to do this with only a "practical amount" of human supervision, rather than extensive training data curation or tuning.The motivation appears to be enabling wider adoption and transparency of LLMs for tool manipulation by enhancing open-source models, while keeping the human effort practical. The authors seem to want to understand if and how open-source LLMs can reach parity with closed models in this domain with reasonable effort.Does this summary accurately capture the main research question? Let me know if you need any clarification on my interpretation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Introducing a new benchmark suite called ToolBench for evaluating tool manipulation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). ToolBench consists of 8 diverse tasks involving manipulating real-world software tools and APIs.- Analyzing the challenges faced by open-source LLMs in tool manipulation tasks compared to proprietary models like GPT-4, and identifying key issues like difficulty with API selection, argument filling, and generating executable code. - Proposing and validating techniques like model alignment, demonstration retrieval, and system prompts to enhance open-source LLMs for tool manipulation with minimal human supervision.- Showing that the proposed techniques can improve leading open-source models to attain competitive results with GPT-4 on 4 out of 8 ToolBench tasks, with only about 1 day of human effort per task.In summary, the main contribution appears to be creating ToolBench as the first open benchmark for tool manipulation, analyzing challenges for open-source LLMs, and demonstrating simple yet effective techniques to boost their capabilities to be on par with state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs on certain tasks. The techniques require minimal supervision, providing a practical recipe for enhancing open-source LLMs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper focuses on using large language models (LLMs) for tool manipulation tasks. This aligns with an emerging area of research applying LLMs to interact with software systems and control tools. Other recent works like ToolFormer, API.AI, and ToolUseAI have also explored using LLMs for tool manipulation.- A key distinction of this work is the focus on enhancing open-source LLMs to match proprietary models like GPT-4. Much prior research has relied solely on closed commercial LLMs. Studying methods to improve open models for tool use is novel and impactful.- The techniques explored, like model alignment with synthetic data and using demonstrations, are not entirely new ideas in the LLM literature. But adapting them to the context of tool manipulation with minimal supervision is a creative application.- The benchmark suite introduced provides the first open testbed for quantitatively evaluating tool manipulation capabilities. Other recent works have not released the full testing suites for open research. This contribution enables standardized evaluation.- Overall, while not introducing brand new techniques, this work provides very useful insights on the challenges faced by open LLMs for tool use. The practical enhancement approach and introduction of an open benchmark push forward the transparency and accessibility of research on tool-enabled LLMs.In summary, the key novelties are the focus on open models, the practical tuning approach requiring minimal supervision, and the public benchmark for evaluation. The work nicely combines ideas from prior LLM literature and applies them creatively to advance an important emerging research area. The contributions align well with and move beyond related recent works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Develop methods to enhance open-source LLMs for tool manipulation capabilities comparable to closed LLMs, with minimal human supervision. The authors propose techniques like model alignment, system prompts, and demonstration retrieval as promising directions.- Explore algorithms tailored for tool manipulation tasks, such as retrieval techniques for selecting relevant API documentation. The authors used an off-the-shelf retriever but suggest exploring specialized algorithms. - Address remaining challenges for tasks requiring advanced reasoning, such as the Google Sheets, WebShop and Tabletop tasks in the paper. The enhanced open-source LLMs still had relatively low performance on these tasks.- Expand the benchmark (ToolBench) to cover more diverse tools and software environments. The authors released ToolBench as an open benchmark to facilitate further research.- Investigate techniques to reduce the amount of human supervision needed. The authors showed their methods only require minimal supervision but suggest exploring ways to further minimize human effort.- Study methods for acquiring tool manipulation skills with even less task-specific data, getting closer to few-shot or zero-shot learning.- Explore approaches for tool manipulation in a multi-step setting and with natural language interaction. The authors briefly mentioned this more complex setting.In summary, the key directions are developing methods to enhance open-source LLMs for tool manipulation, minimizing human supervision, expanding the benchmark to more tasks, and investigating techniques for low-shot learning and more complex interactions. The authors aim to inspire further research to advance open-source LLMs for practical tool manipulation capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes techniques to enhance open-source large language models (LLMs) for software tool manipulation. Tool manipulation by LLMs involves generating API calls from natural language instructions to accomplish user goals. The authors first observe a significant gap in tool manipulation capabilities between proprietary closed LLMs like GPT-4 versus open-source LLMs. To understand the root causes, they analyze common failures in tool manipulation by open-source LLMs and identify three key challenges: difficulty selecting the right APIs, confusion populating API arguments, and generating non-executable text beyond just code. To address these challenges, the authors adapt three techniques from the LLM literature - model alignment through training with synthetic data, an in-context demonstration retriever, and system prompts - to improve open-source LLM performance on tool manipulation. They introduce the SNAP benchmark with 8 diverse tools to evaluate these techniques. The results demonstrate that their proposed methods can significantly boost the success rate of leading open-source LLMs by up to 90%, attaining competitiveness with GPT-4 APIs on 4 out of 8 SNAP tasks. The techniques require minimal human supervision, implying a practical recipe for enhancing open-source LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a method for enhancing the tool manipulation capabilities of open-source large language models (LLMs) to be competitive with leading proprietary LLMs. The key techniques include 1) model alignment by finetuning the LLM on synthetically generated datasets of tool usage examples, 2) augmenting the LLM with an in-context demonstration retriever module that provides relevant API usage examples during inference, and 3) using a system prompt to regulate the LLM to generate only executable API calls. These techniques require only a small amount of human supervision in the form of API usage templates and demonstration examples. The techniques are evaluated on a benchmark suite of 8 diverse real-world tool manipulation tasks, showing they can significantly improve the success rate of open-source LLMs like LLaMA, making them competitive with proprietary models like GPT-4. The results demonstrate that with a practical level of human supervision, open-source LLMs can attain strong performance on tool manipulation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one paragraph summary: The paper proposes techniques to enhance open-source large language models (LLMs) for software tool manipulation, allowing them to achieve performance competitive with proprietary closed LLM APIs. The authors first analyze common failures of open-source LLMs on tool manipulation tasks, identifying challenges in API selection, argument populating, and non-executable generation. To address these challenges, they adapt three techniques from the LLM literature - model alignment through training with synthetically generated data, retrieval of in-context demonstrations, and system prompts to constrain generation. The authors introduce the Snact benchmark for quantitative tool manipulation evaluation, and empirically validate their techniques. Using model alignment, in-context learning, and system prompts, they are able to significantly improve open-source LLM performance on Snact, attaining results competitive with the proprietary GPT-4 API on 4 out of 8 tasks. The techniques require minimal human supervision, providing a practical recipe for building capable tool manipulation systems using open-source LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to enhance the capabilities of open-source large language models (LLMs) for software tool manipulation so that they can be competitive with leading proprietary/closed LLMs, while using only a practical amount of human supervision. Specifically, the paper notes that recent work on tool manipulation with LLMs has mostly relied on closed/proprietary LLM APIs from companies like OpenAI. However, using these closed APIs in real-world applications has risks related to security, robustness, and transparency. So the authors want to see if it's possible to get open-source LLMs to a similar level of capability, which would allow for more flexibility and transparency.To investigate this question, the authors first look at why open-source LLMs struggle with tool manipulation compared to closed LLMs. They identify three main challenges:1) Difficulty selecting the right APIs for a given goal2) Confusion in populating API arguments properly3) Tendency to produce non-executable natural language instead of codeBased on these insights, the authors adapt three techniques commonly used to enhance LLMs for natural language tasks, applying them to the context of tool manipulation:1) Model alignment through training on programatically generated API usage examples 2) In-context demonstration retrieval to provide relevant examples at inference time3) System prompts to constrain the model to generate executable codeThe authors show these techniques can significantly improve the performance of open-source LLMs on a new benchmark suite they introduce called ToolBench. With relatively minimal human supervision (e.g. 1 day per tool to generate alignment data), they demonstrate open-source LLM performance competitive with the proprietary OpenAI API on several tool manipulation tasks.In summary, the key problem is enhancing open-source LLMs for tool manipulation with minimal supervision, and the authors introduce techniques adapted from the NLP literature that can successfully bridge much of the capability gap compared to closed LLMs. The ToolBench benchmark provides a way to evaluate these methods.
