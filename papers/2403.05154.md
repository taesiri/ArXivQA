# [GSEdit: Efficient Text-Guided Editing of 3D Objects via Gaussian   Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper focuses on 3D object editing, allowing users to transform a given 3D object into a modified version based on a text prompt. 
- Existing methods for 3D generation like NeRF are prone to artifacts. Gaussian Splatting (GS) provides high-quality 3D reconstructions but lacks editing capabilities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a pipeline called GSEdit that takes as input a GS scene and allows editing it based on a text prompt to change attributes like shape, style or texture.

Pipeline:
1. Input Representation: Handles GS inputs from different sources like multi-view renders or generative models. Focuses on single foreground objects.

2. 3D Object Editing: Renders input object from multiple views. Feeds renders into Image2Prompt2Image (IP2P) model along with text prompt. IP2P makes incremental edits aligned with prompt. GS scene parameters updated via differentiable rendering to match edits.

3. Mesh Extraction: Extracts mesh from edited point cloud using density queries and marching cubes. Assigns texture via back-projection.  

4. Texture Refinement: Refines texture using stable diffusion as a denoising prior.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first method to allow text-guided editing of pre-existing 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.
- Presents a cyclical pipeline to iteratively apply edits from IP2P model to rendered views and propagate them back to update the GS scene parameters.
- Demonstrates high-quality shape and appearance transformations like changing object identity or style while retaining original features.

The summary covers the key points about the problem being addressed, the proposed GSEdit solution and pipeline, and highlights the main contributions around enabling text-guided 3D editing of Gaussian Splatting scenes.
