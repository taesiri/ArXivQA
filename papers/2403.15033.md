# [Toward Tiny and High-quality Facial Makeup with Data Amplify Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing facial makeup transfer methods rely on complex pipelines and large models, making deployment on mobile devices very challenging. Specifically, they suffer from the following limitations:

1) Rely on unpaired training data, leading to inaccurate supervision and requiring additional face alignment techniques like facial landmarks, increasing model complexity. 

2) Large model sizes, often exceeding 1M parameters, due to the need for adversarial training and attention mechanisms to enable learning from unpaired data.

3) Inability to generate complete makeup effects like clear eyeliner and brows.

4) Require pre-processing steps like face parsing, further increasing latency.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new learning paradigm called Data Amplify Learning (DAL) to address the above limitations. The key ideas are:

1) A Diffusion-based Data Amplifier (DDA) that can amplify a small set of paired makeup images (e.g. 5 pairs) into a large paired dataset using novel techniques like Residual Diffusion Model and Fine-Grained Makeup Module.

2) Train a compact CNN-based model called TinyBeauty on the amplified paired data to learn makeup transfer end-to-end without any face pre-processing. 

3) Introduce an eyeliner loss in TinyBeauty to explicitly learn clear eyeliner effects.

Main Contributions:

1) Data Amplify Learning that can produce high-quality training data from a few samples to enable accurate pixel-level supervision.

2) Diffusion-based Data Amplifier with innovations like Residual Diffusion and Fine-Grained Makeup Module to generate diverse, identity-preserving makeup effects.

3) TinyBeauty - an efficient 14-layer CNN for facial makeup, enabled by DAL. It is 13x faster than prior work with 17.3% better image quality.

4) State-of-the-art makeup transfer performance is achieved using only 5 training pairs, with the ability to generate fine details like eyeliner/brows. Deployable on smartphones with 80K parameters.

In summary, the paper enables highly efficient and high-quality facial makeup transfer using a novel data amplification technique to train compact models, overcoming limitations of prior work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new facial makeup transfer method called Data Amplify Learning, which uses a diffusion model to amplify a small number of paired examples into a large dataset to train a lightweight 14-layer convolutional network called TinyBeauty that achieves state-of-the-art quality and speed on mobile devices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new learning framework called "Data Amplify Learning" (DAL) for facial makeup transfer. Specifically:

1) It introduces a Diffusion-based Data Amplifier (DDA) that can amplify a small set of paired makeup/non-makeup images (e.g. 5 image pairs) into a large-scale synthesized dataset. The DDA uses innovations like a Residual Diffusion Model and Fine-Grained Makeup Module to generate high-quality and controllable makeup images while preserving facial details and identity.

2) Leveraging the amplified paired data from DDA, the paper trains a compact facial makeup model called "TinyBeauty" that only has 14 convolution layers and 80K parameters. TinyBeauty achieves state-of-the-art performance on facial makeup transfer without needing complex face alignment pipelines used in previous methods.

3) Experiments show TinyBeauty can run extremely fast (460 FPS) on a mobile phone while surpassing prior works on metrics like PSNR. The proposed DAL scheme also demonstrates surprising effectiveness - producing highly competitive makeup transfer models even when trained on just 5 image pairs.

In summary, the key innovation is DAL, which enables training high-performance tiny facial makeup models using limited data, with superior speed and quality compared to previous approaches. The compact TinyBeauty model exemplifies the capabilities unlocked by the proposed DAL scheme.
