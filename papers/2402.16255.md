# [Watch Your Head: Assembling Projection Heads to Save the Reliability of   Federated Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning encounters challenges with heterogeneous client data, leading to performance degradation and convergence issues. However, the reliability aspect of federated models has received little attention. 
- The paper investigates the reliability of both generic and personalized federated models. Experiments uncover that federated models exhibit poor reliability compared to centralized models, with overconfidence on misclassified in-distribution samples and low uncertainty on out-of-distribution samples.
- This unreliability is primarily attributed to the biased projection heads in federated models which introduce miscalibration.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Assembled Projection Heads" (APH), a method to enhance reliability of federated models. 
- APH treats existing projection head parameters as priors and samples multiple initialized heads from Gaussian perturbations of the priors. 
- These heads are fine-tuned on local data under varying learning rates to introduce parameter diversity. 
- Reliable predictions are produced via head averaging during inference.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a systematic analysis showing federated models are unreliable compared to centralized models, establishing biased projection heads as a main cause.
- Proposes APH, a lightweight method to improve federated model reliability via projection head ensembling and fine-tuning.
- Validates APH across models and datasets, showing improved calibration on in-distribution data and uncertainty quantification on out-of-distribution data.
- Demonstrates compatibility with various federated learning algorithms and robustness across federated settings.

In summary, the paper uncovers and addresses the important problem of reliability in federated learning via a simple yet effective projection head ensembling approach. The analysis and proposed method aim to make federated models more trustworthy for practical usage.
