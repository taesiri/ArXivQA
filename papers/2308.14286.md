# [Bridging Cross-task Protocol Inconsistency for Distillation in Dense   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14286)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it aims to address is:How can knowledge distillation for dense object detection be improved by bridging the cross-task protocol inconsistency between distillation and classification?The key hypothesis appears to be:By converting inconsistent cross-task protocols into consistent protocols tailored for dense object detection, both classification and localization distillation can be significantly improved.In particular, the paper identifies that common classification distillation techniques directly adopt the softmax protocol from image classification, which leads to suboptimal results when applied to dense object detectors that use sigmoid. To address this protocol inconsistency, the authors propose a binary classification distillation loss using sigmoid. They also introduce a novel IoU-based localization distillation loss to avoid relying on specific prediction heads like prior work. The central goal is to show these tailored distillation losses that bridge the cross-task inconsistencies can substantially boost student detector performance on tasks like classification and localization for dense object detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It identifies the cross-task protocol inconsistency problem as a key reason for the ineffectiveness of applying original classification distillation techniques directly to dense object detection. The protocols used for classification distillation (softmax) and dense object detection (sigmoid) differ, leading to suboptimal solutions when minimizing the distillation loss. 2. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Binary Classification Distillation Loss that converts the problem into multiple binary classification distillation tasks. This allows consistent protocols to be used for distillation and dense object detection.3. The paper also proposes an IoU-based Localization Distillation Loss that eliminates the need for a special prediction head like the Generalized Focal Loss used in prior works. This makes the distillation approach more widely applicable.4. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed distillation losses significantly improve performance over baseline and prior logit distillation techniques for dense object detection. The method also combines well with existing feature distillation techniques for further gains.In summary, the key contribution is identifying and addressing the protocol inconsistency issue to enable more effective logit distillation for dense object detection, through tailored binary classification and IoU-based localization distillation losses.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:The paper proposes novel distillation losses tailored for classification and localization in dense object detection to address the limitations of applying existing logit distillation techniques directly from image classification, achieving improved performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is an analysis comparing this paper to other related works in knowledge distillation for object detection:- This paper focuses on addressing the limitations of logit-based knowledge distillation techniques for dense object detectors. Prior works like LD have found that directly applying softmax-based classification distillation used in image classification leads to minimal gains in detection. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of why this cross-task protocol inconsistency arises and proposes tailored solutions.- Most prior work has focused on feature-based distillation methods like FGD, PKD, MGD, etc that aim to mimic intermediate feature representations. This paper explores the less studied area of logit-based distillation and shows it can also be effective if tailored for detection.- A key contribution is identifying the mismatch between sigmoid-based scoring used in detectors vs softmax-based scoring used in distillation. The proposed binary classification distillation loss solves this inconsistency and shows significant gains from transferring classification knowledge.- For localization distillation, this paper removes the need for specialized prediction heads like LD and proposes a simple IoU-based loss that works with standard bounding box regression. This increases applicability.- Overall, the techniques are simple but effective. The gains combine well with existing feature mimicry techniques, demonstrating they are complementary. This provides a new direction in logit distillation for detection.- Compared to concurrent work like GID that uses response-based distillation, this paper provides more conceptual insights on tackling protocol inconsistency and uses a simpler full-image distillation approach without needing to select regions.In summary, this paper moves beyond common wisdom that classification distillation is ineffective for detection. The analysis and tailored solutions unlock gains from logit mimicking in this problem space. It opens up a new research direction complementary to feature distillation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring ways to further improve classification distillation in dense object detection. The authors show promising results with their proposed binary classification distillation loss, but suggest there may be opportunities to develop this further.- Investigating other potential causes of suboptimal classification distillation besides the cross-task protocol inconsistency identified in this work. The authors used simplified experiments to isolate this issue, but in more complex scenarios there could be other factors at play.- Extending the ideas to distillation in other dense prediction tasks like segmentation, where the foreground-background imbalance issue also exists. The insights on handling cross-task differences could potentially translate.- Studying whether mimicking the score distribution itself could be beneficial, not just the binary classification scores. The distribution information may capture additional useful knowledge.- Exploring ensemble distillation, where multiple teacher models could provide more diverse supervision signals to the student model.- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of model architectures, datasets, and application scenarios. This could reveal new challenges or opportunities for knowledge distillation techniques.- Combining the proposed distillation losses with other distillation techniques like attention map mimicking to see if complementary gains can be achieved.So in summary, the authors point to further improving classification distillation, extending to related tasks, exploring ways to transfer richer knowledge, and more comprehensive empirical analysis as interesting directions for future work.
