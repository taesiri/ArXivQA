# [Converting Epics/Stories into Pseudocode using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05047)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a two-stage methodology to automatically generate pseudocode from natural language user stories or requirements in agile software development. The goal is to simplify and streamline the software development process by quickly translating user needs into implementable pseudocode. The first stage uses the CodeT5 natural language processing model to convert the user story text into Python code, treating it as a machine translation task. The second stage converts this Python code into pseudocode, which abstracts away programming language specifics. For evaluation, the BLEU metric is used, with stage one achieving a score of 0.4, denoting understandable translations, and stage two achieving 0.74, signalling high-quality translation of the Python into generally correct pseudocode. The advantage of generating pseudocode is it allows easy conversion into any target programming language. In conclusion, natural language processing, specifically transfer learning methods like CodeT5, show promise in automatically producing valid pseudocode from end-user requirements. This can focus programmer efforts on complex logic rather than repetitive translation of specifications. Future work involves curating larger datasets to improve accuracy and generalization capability.
