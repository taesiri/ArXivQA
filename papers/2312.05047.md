# [Converting Epics/Stories into Pseudocode using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05047)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a two-stage methodology to automatically generate pseudocode from natural language user stories or requirements in agile software development. The goal is to simplify and streamline the software development process by quickly translating user needs into implementable pseudocode. The first stage uses the CodeT5 natural language processing model to convert the user story text into Python code, treating it as a machine translation task. The second stage converts this Python code into pseudocode, which abstracts away programming language specifics. For evaluation, the BLEU metric is used, with stage one achieving a score of 0.4, denoting understandable translations, and stage two achieving 0.74, signalling high-quality translation of the Python into generally correct pseudocode. The advantage of generating pseudocode is it allows easy conversion into any target programming language. In conclusion, natural language processing, specifically transfer learning methods like CodeT5, show promise in automatically producing valid pseudocode from end-user requirements. This can focus programmer efforts on complex logic rather than repetitive translation of specifications. Future work involves curating larger datasets to improve accuracy and generalization capability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage methodology using the CodeT5 model to automatically convert user stories written in English into pseudocode, with the goal of streamlining software development in organizations utilizing the Agile methodology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper proposes a two-stage methodology to convert English language user stories/epics from tools like Jira into pseudocode. The two stages are:

1) Text to Code Conversion: Convert the natural language text into Python code using the CodeT5 model.

2) Code to Pseudocode Conversion: Convert the generated Python code into pseudocode using the CodeT5 model. 

The advantage of generating pseudocode is that it is programming language agnostic and can be easily converted into any language the developer prefers. The paper shows this can simplify and accelerate development workflows in organizations following agile methodologies and using tools like Jira.

The key results are that the CodeT5 model achieves a BLEU score of 0.4 for the Text to Code stage and 0.74 for the Code to Pseudocode stage. This demonstrates the feasibility and potential of using this transformer-based approach to automate the generation of pseudocode from natural language text.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a two-stage methodology leveraging CodeT5 to automatically generate pseudocode from natural language requirements to simplify agile software development.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage approach for converting text to pseudocode. What is the motivation behind splitting this into two stages rather than doing direct text to pseudocode conversion? What are the advantages of this two-stage approach?

2. The first stage converts text to Python code. Why was Python chosen as the intermediate code representation language? What properties of Python make it suitable for this task? 

3. The paper treats both stages (text to code and code to pseudocode) as language translation tasks. What are the implications of framing the problem in this way? How does it enable leveraging recent advances in machine translation?

4. The CodeT5 model is used for both translation tasks. What makes this model suitable for code generation compared to other transformer models? What modifications or pre-training does CodeT5 employ to understand programming language constructs better?

5. The CodeT5 model is trained separately on the two stages - why is the model not trained end-to-end from text to pseudocode in one go? What constraints lead to the decision of stage-wise training?

6. How much training data is required at each stage to make the model generate accurate translations? What techniques can be used to train the model with limited data?

7. The BLEU scores reported are 0.4 for text to code translation and 0.74 for code to pseudocode. What could lead to such a difference in BLEU scores? How can the text to code translation be further improved?  

8. The paper compares the approach to a rule-based system for code to pseudocode conversion. What are some limitations of using hand-coded rules for translation instead of a machine learning model?

9. What additional qualitative analysis can be performed on the generated pseudocode besides using automated metrics like BLEU? What would human evaluation reveal about the results?

10. The conclusion proposes future work like curating larger datasets. What difficulties do you anticipate in collecting quality text-code and code-pseudocode pairs for training machine translation models?
