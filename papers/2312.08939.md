# [EAT: Towards Long-Tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08939)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called EAT to address the challenging problem of long-tailed out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, where the training data follows a long-tailed class distribution. The key difficulty lies in distinguishing OOD data from tail-class samples. To overcome this, EAT presents two main ideas: (1) Expanding the classification space by introducing multiple abstention classes and assigning OOD data to these classes using dynamic virtual labels. This builds clear decision boundaries between inliers and outliers. (2) Augmenting tail-class images by overlaying them onto context-rich OOD images using CutMix. This forces the model to focus on discriminative foreground features of tail classes. Additionally, the paper provides insights into the impact of virtual labels through an analysis of gradient noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAT boosts the AUROC by 2.0% and inlier accuracy by 2.9% over previous state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets. Notably, EAT serves as an effective add-on to improve OOD detection for existing long-tail methods. The key findings challenge the notion that a strong inlier classifier necessarily translates to good OOD detection.
