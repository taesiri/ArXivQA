# [Spectral Enhanced Rectangle Transformer for Hyperspectral Image   Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00844)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize the spatial non-local self-similarity and global spectral low-rank property of hyperspectral images for HSI denoising. Specifically, the paper proposes a spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer to jointly model the spatial and spectral correlations to suppress noise and restore clean HSI.

The key hypotheses are:

1) Modeling non-local spatial similarity beyond local regions can help aggregate similar patterns for noise removal. 

2) Exploiting the global low-rank spectral statistics can help suppress noise and restore more accurate spectral information.

3) Jointly utilizing spatial non-local self-similarity and global spectral low-rank property in a unified framework can achieve better HSI denoising performance.

The proposed spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer aims to validate these hypotheses by:

1) Introducing a multi-shape rectangle self-attention module to capture non-local spatial similarity.

2) Designing a spectral enhancement module to extract global low-rank spectral statistics from spatial-spectral cubes. 

3) Integrating the spatial and spectral modeling in a unified Transformer framework.

Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy HSIs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and validate the research hypotheses. The joint utilization of spatial non-local similarity and spectral low-rank property is shown to achieve superior denoising performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer (SERT) for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising. The SERT explores both the non-local spatial similarity and global spectral low-rank property of HSIs.

2. It introduces a multi-shape rectangle self-attention module to capture non-local spatial similarity in an efficient way. Different rectangle shapes are used at different layers to explore comprehensive spatial similarity. 

3. It designs a spectral enhancement module with a memory unit to extract informative low-rank vectors that represent the global spectral statistics. This module provides interactions between spatial rectangles and suppresses noise.

4. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy HSIs demonstrate that SERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in HSI denoising. It shows the effectiveness of jointly modeling spatial and spectral characteristics for HSI restoration.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer that effectively utilizes the spatial non-local similarity and global spectral low-rank property for HSI denoising. The specially designed Transformer architecture leads to superior performance compared to existing methods.
