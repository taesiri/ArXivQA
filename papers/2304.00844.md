# [Spectral Enhanced Rectangle Transformer for Hyperspectral Image   Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00844)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively utilize the spatial non-local self-similarity and global spectral low-rank property of hyperspectral images for HSI denoising. Specifically, the paper proposes a spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer to jointly model the spatial and spectral correlations to suppress noise and restore clean HSI.

The key hypotheses are:

1) Modeling non-local spatial similarity beyond local regions can help aggregate similar patterns for noise removal. 

2) Exploiting the global low-rank spectral statistics can help suppress noise and restore more accurate spectral information.

3) Jointly utilizing spatial non-local self-similarity and global spectral low-rank property in a unified framework can achieve better HSI denoising performance.

The proposed spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer aims to validate these hypotheses by:

1) Introducing a multi-shape rectangle self-attention module to capture non-local spatial similarity.

2) Designing a spectral enhancement module to extract global low-rank spectral statistics from spatial-spectral cubes. 

3) Integrating the spatial and spectral modeling in a unified Transformer framework.

Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy HSIs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and validate the research hypotheses. The joint utilization of spatial non-local similarity and spectral low-rank property is shown to achieve superior denoising performance.
