# [Addressing the Regulatory Gap: Moving Towards an EU AI Audit Ecosystem   Beyond the AIA by Including Civil Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07904)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- AI systems can cause serious harms, but oversight is lacking. The EU has proposed regulations like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) to address this.  
- However, there is a gap in these regulations regarding third-party audits and data access, which are crucial for accountability. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors define an "AI audit ecosystem" involving diverse, independent auditors (researchers, civil society, etc.) that ensures compliance and oversight. 
- They argue third-party audits are essential for such an ecosystem to prevent issues like audit washing by companies. Even with limited "black box" access, third parties have exposed issues.  
- The DSA provides some data access to "vetted researchers" but should be expanded to include NGOs and journalists who have domain expertise.
- The AIA currently lacks data access provisions and should include them, at least for high-risk AI systems.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the properties of an AI audit ecosystem for accountability.
- Highlights a regulatory gap in the DSA/AIA framework that prevents establishing such an ecosystem.
- Emphasizes the value of third-party audits and argues the AIA should mandate data/model access for certain AI systems.
- Makes policy recommendations like expanding vetted researcher access in DSA, incorporating third-party access in AIA, legal protections for auditors, publishing audit results, etc.

In summary, the paper argues that an AI audit ecosystem with diverse, independent auditors having data access is crucial for accountability. The authors highlight limitations in existing EU regulations to enable this and provide recommendations.
