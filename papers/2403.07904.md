# [Addressing the Regulatory Gap: Moving Towards an EU AI Audit Ecosystem   Beyond the AIA by Including Civil Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07904)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- AI systems can cause serious harms, but oversight is lacking. The EU has proposed regulations like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) to address this.  
- However, there is a gap in these regulations regarding third-party audits and data access, which are crucial for accountability. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors define an "AI audit ecosystem" involving diverse, independent auditors (researchers, civil society, etc.) that ensures compliance and oversight. 
- They argue third-party audits are essential for such an ecosystem to prevent issues like audit washing by companies. Even with limited "black box" access, third parties have exposed issues.  
- The DSA provides some data access to "vetted researchers" but should be expanded to include NGOs and journalists who have domain expertise.
- The AIA currently lacks data access provisions and should include them, at least for high-risk AI systems.

Main Contributions:
- Defines the properties of an AI audit ecosystem for accountability.
- Highlights a regulatory gap in the DSA/AIA framework that prevents establishing such an ecosystem.
- Emphasizes the value of third-party audits and argues the AIA should mandate data/model access for certain AI systems.
- Makes policy recommendations like expanding vetted researcher access in DSA, incorporating third-party access in AIA, legal protections for auditors, publishing audit results, etc.

In summary, the paper argues that an AI audit ecosystem with diverse, independent auditors having data access is crucial for accountability. The authors highlight limitations in existing EU regulations to enable this and provide recommendations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper defines an AI audit ecosystem, analyzes EU regulations regarding third-party audits and data access, identifies a regulatory gap, and makes policy recommendations to establish an ecosystem with compliance and oversight mechanisms involving diverse auditors and audit types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It defines an AI audit ecosystem that incorporates compliance and oversight mechanisms. 

2) It highlights a regulatory gap within the EU's DSA and AIA framework that prevents the establishment of a robust AI audit ecosystem. Specifically, the AIA does not provide for third-party audits or data access.

3) It emphasizes that third-party audits by research and civil society actors must be part of an AI audit ecosystem, and argues that the AIA should be amended to include data and model access provisions, at least for high-risk AI systems.

In summary, the paper argues that a diverse ecosystem of auditors, including third parties like researchers and NGOs, is necessary to provide effective oversight and accountability of AI systems. It finds shortcomings in the EU's regulatory approach that fail to enable such an ecosystem, and makes policy recommendations to address this gap.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it are:

- Auditing
- Accountability 
- Data Access
- AI Act
- DSA
- Regulation
- Algorithmic audits
- Third-party audits
- AI audit ecosystem
- Compliance
- Oversight
- First-party audits
- Second-party audits  
- Audit washing
- False assurances
- Information asymmetry
- Power asymmetry
- Affected communities
- Vetted researchers

The paper focuses on analyzing third-party audits, especially by researchers and civil society, in the context of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) and Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). It argues that third-party audits are essential for establishing an "AI audit ecosystem" that ensures accountability through compliance and oversight mechanisms. Key aspects examined include audit washing, adaptivity to new AI technologies, inclusion of affected communities, and addressing information/power asymmetries. The paper ultimately finds a "regulatory gap" in the DSA and AIA regarding the ecosystem, and provides policy recommendations for including third-party audits and data access, especially for high-risk AI systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an "AI audit ecosystem" but does not clearly define all its components. What specific entities and processes should be part of this ecosystem and what roles should they play? 

2. The paper argues that third-party audits are essential for oversight and compliance. But what specific oversight capabilities do third parties have that first and second parties lack? What evidence supports this?

3. The paper claims internal audits are prone to "audit washing" and false assurances. What evidence exists to support how prevalent this problem is? What safeguards could prevent it? 

4. The paper argues third parties have valuable domain knowledge from a "sociotechnical system thinking" perspective. But isn't sociotechnical thinking part of many first party impact assessment methodologies nowadays? What additional perspective do third parties provide?

5. The paper claims affected communities "trust third party auditors more". Is there empirical evidence to support this across different cultural contexts? What factors drive this trust?  

6. The paper recommends granting "at minimum" black box access to third parties. What criteria should determine granting higher levels of access? Should access level depend on audit purpose?

7. The paper argues third parties can help develop standards for new and evolving technologies. But developing standards requires deep technical expertise - do third parties have this? What evidence is there they have contributed significantly to standards historically?

8. The paper claims third parties can reduce information asymmetry. But couldn't information sharing between first, second and third parties also achieve this? What barriers exist to such sharing today?

9. The paper proposes several policy recommendations related to audits and access. What evidence exists on the feasibility, costs and benefits of implementing these - either individually or collectively as a package? 

10. The paper focuses on EU regulations, arguing they do not sufficiently enable a third-party audit ecosystem. To what extent do other regulatory regimes, such as in the US or China, better enable third party auditing today? What evidence is there on the efficacy of these regimes?
