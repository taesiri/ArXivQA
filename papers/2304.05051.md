# [FashionSAP: Symbols and Attributes Prompt for Fine-grained Fashion   Vision-Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is how to improve vision-language pre-training models for fashion tasks by better capturing fine-grained attributes and fashion-specific semantics. 

The key hypothesis is that using fashion symbols to represent categories and prompts for fine-grained attributes will enable the model to learn better fashion representations compared to general vision-language pre-training models. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1. Using fashion symbols to represent categories will help the model capture similarities between fashion items based on body parts and product functions. 

2. Prompting for fine-grained attributes will force the model to learn attribute-level semantics more explicitly.

3. The proposed techniques of fashion symbols and attribute prompting will improve performance on downstream fashion tasks compared to general vision-language models that do not focus on fashion-specific representations.

The experiments aim to validate if the proposed FashionSAP model outperforms previous state-of-the-art on fashion tasks and ablation studies analyze the impact of the specific proposed techniques. So in summary, the central hypothesis is around improving fashion vision-language pre-training by incorporating fashion domain knowledge through symbols and attribute prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an effective fine-grained vision-language pre-training model called FashionSAP to learn attribute-level fashion knowledge. 

2. Introducing an abstract fashion concept layer with 9 fashion symbols to represent various fashion concepts based on their similarities in body parts and product functions.

3. Proposing an attributes prompt method to enable the model to explicitly learn fine-grained fashion characteristics.

To summarize, the paper proposes a novel method called FashionSAP that incorporates fashion symbols and attributes prompting to enhance vision-language pre-training for the fashion domain. The key ideas are using fashion symbols to capture relationships between similar fashion categories, and prompting attributes to learn fine-grained fashion features. Experiments show FashionSAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on fashion retrieval, recognition and retrieval tasks. The ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
