# [Abusing Images and Sounds for Indirect Instruction Injection in   Multi-Modal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10490)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper demonstrates a new method for exploiting multi-modal large language models (LLMs) through indirect prompt injection attacks using perturbed images and audio. The authors generate adversarial perturbations that encode prompts or instructions which are blended into images or audio samples. When a user provides the perturbed input to an unmodified multi-modal LLM and asks it a question, the perturbation steers the model to output attacker-chosen text or follow the injected instruction in subsequent dialog turns. The method is used in targeted text output attacks and dialog poisoning attacks with proofs of concept against LLaVA and PandaGPT models. The perturbation crafting method leverages teacher forcing and is input-agnostic. The attacks highlight risks from processing external multi-modal content even in isolated LLMs. While initial examples are presented, the method could likely achieve more sophisticated control given greater compute resources and more capable victim models. The work expands the threat surface for multi-modal LLMs and prompts further research into detection and mitigation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates how adversarial perturbations can be used to inject prompts and instructions into images and audio to steer multi-modal language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper demonstrates how adversarial perturbations can be used to inject arbitrary textual prompts or instructions into images and audio recordings when they are processed by multi-modal large language models (LLMs). The perturbations steer the models to output attacker-controlled text or follow attacker-chosen instructions in subsequent dialog with human users. This is concerning because even isolated multi-modal LLMs that don't access external content can be manipulated this way, via innocent users who query the models about compromised media. The authors show proof-of-concept attacks targeting two open-source multi-modal LLMs, LLaVA and PandaGPT. The adversarial examples crafting process allows injection of any prompt into any image/audio while preserving the content, so the models can still discuss the media with users. Overall, the work highlights risks of using generative multi-modal LLMs in real-world applications. It suggests that defense strategies may need to analyze inputs for blended instructions even in modalities like images and audio.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates how adversarial perturbations can be used to inject malicious instructions into images and audio files, which then steer the behavior of multi-modal language models when users ask them questions about the perturbed inputs.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

Can adversarial perturbations be used to inject malicious prompts and instructions into images and audio inputs for multi-modal large language models (LLMs)?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by blending specially crafted adversarial perturbations into images or audio clips, attackers can inject prompts and instructions that will steer the behavior of multi-modal LLMs when users query them about the perturbed inputs. 

The paper demonstrates proof-of-concept attacks using this approach against two open-source multi-modal LLMs, LLaVA and PandaGPT. The attacks include targeted-output attacks to force specific model responses, and dialog poisoning attacks to steer the model's behavior over multiple turns.

So in summary, the main research question is whether adversarial perturbation of inputs can be used for indirect prompt injection attacks on multi-modal LLMs. The hypothesis is that this approach can succeed in injecting malicious instructions that manipulate model behavior. The experiments provide evidence to support the hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating how images and sounds can be used to inject malicious prompts and instructions into multi-modal large language models (LLMs) like LLaVA and PandaGPT. 

Specifically, the authors show how an attacker can craft adversarial perturbations corresponding to a prompt/instruction and blend them into an image or audio clip. When a user provides the perturbed input to the benign LLM and asks it a question, the perturbation causes the model to output text chosen by the attacker and/or follow the attacker's instructions in subsequent dialog turns.

The key ideas demonstrated in the paper are:

- Images and audio can be used as stealthy vectors for injecting prompts into multi-modal LLMs, even if the model does not have access to external content.

- The attacker exploits the user as an unwitting injection vector by luring them to input compromised images/audio.

- The perturbations are crafted using adversarial example techniques to minimize changes to the semantic content.

- Two attack variants are shown: targeted-output to force specific text, and dialog poisoning to steer the LLM's future behavior.

So in summary, the main contribution is showing the feasibility of adversarial prompt injection into multi-modal LLMs via images and audio. The techniques enable both targeted-output and dialog poisoning attacks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper presents a novel attack vector for injecting prompts/instructions into multi-modal large language models (LLMs) via perturbations in images and audio. Prior work has focused more on text-based prompt injection against non-multimodal LLMs.

- The paper demonstrates two types of attacks - targeted output and dialog poisoning. The dialog poisoning attack in particular takes advantage of the auto-regressive nature and conversation context maintenance in dialog LLMs. 

- The approach of using imperceptible perturbations to inject instructions, without significantly changing the semantics of the input, is unique. Other approaches like adding text prompts directly would be more noticeable.

- The attack model of exploiting unwitting human users as vectors for injecting malicious inputs into isolated LLMs expands upon prior threat models.

- Proof-of-concept attacks are shown against two recent open-source multimodal LLMs (LLaVA and PandaGPT). Prior prompt injection work has not specifically targeted multimodal models.

- Compared to concurrent work on adversarial attacks to "jailbreak" LLMs, this paper focuses more on indirect prompt injection as a threat to users, rather than attacks by users.

Overall, this paper presents a novel attack technique and threat model for multimodal LLMs. The results demonstrate risks that providers of such models should be aware of as they expand capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Developing imperceptible adversarial perturbations for injecting instructions. The examples in the paper do not aim for stealthiness, so making the perturbations completely invisible could be an interesting direction to pursue. 

- Exploring universal perturbations that work regardless of the specific image or audio sample they are applied to. The current approach requires crafting a separate perturbation tailored to each input.

- Conducting attacks on more sophisticated models to see if they can be steered by more complex injected instructions. The proofs of concept in the paper use relatively simple open-source models.

- Evaluating the attacks in real-world deployments, since they may succeed probabilistically even if not 100% of the time.

- Imposing bounds on the size of perturbations and quantitatively evaluating the tradeoff between perturbation magnitude and attack success rate.

In summary, the main future directions are around developing more stealthy and robust perturbation techniques, testing on more advanced models, and evaluating effectiveness in real-world settings. The goal is to better understand the scope and limitations of these types of injection attacks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that directly injecting prompts into representations did not work well due to the modality gap between text and image/audio encoders. Could you explain more about why generating representation collisions was difficult? What modifications could potentially make this approach more feasible?

2. When using adversarial perturbations to inject instructions, how exactly is the loss function formulated? Walk through the process of optimizing the perturbations token-by-token in a teacher-forcing manner. 

3. For dialog poisoning, the paper proposes two methods to position the instruction within the model's first response - by forcing the model to generate the instruction spontaneously or by injecting a #Human token. Can you elaborate on the differences between these approaches and why the #Human token may get filtered out?

4. The targeted-output attacks show the model can be forced to output arbitrary text, but how natural or coherent is this generated text compared to the model's normal responses? Does the attack impact fluency or only control the content?

5. You mentioned that the attacks may not be fully reproducible due to the stochastic nature of LLMs. Can you quantify the success rate over multiple runs? How could the attacks be made more robust?

6. Were any constraints or thresholds used during optimization to limit the size of the adversarial perturbation? How was the tradeoff managed between perturbation size and attack success rate? 

7. You noted that making the perturbations imperceptible could be future work. What adversarial training or regularization techniques could potentially improve stealthiness?

8. For audio attacks, how does the perturbation optimization process differ compared to images? What audio encoder architectures were used?

9. The paper focuses on open-source LLMs with limited computational resources. How do you think the attacks could be extended or improved given greater model complexity and compute?

10. You mentioned universal perturbations as a direction for future work. How difficult is it to generate perturbations that are input-agnostic? What modifications would be needed to the current approach?
