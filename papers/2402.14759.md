# [Generalising realisability in statistical learning theory under   epistemic uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14759)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Statistical learning theory makes strong assumptions that train and test data come from the same unknown distribution. This causes issues when distributions drift over time.
- The paper aims to relax these assumptions by considering cases where train and test distributions come from the same credal set (convex set of distributions) to model epistemic uncertainty.  

Proposed Solution
- The paper examines how key concepts like PAC learning and realizability generalize to the credal set setting.
- It provides an initial analysis of how the proof of generalization bounds changes under credal realizability for finite hypothesis spaces. 
- Some options are discussed to generalize realizability by assuming the empirical risk minimization distribution matches the lowest risk distribution, or by a stronger uniform credal realizability condition.

Main Contributions
- First work to analyze how core concepts of statistical learning theory like realizability and generalization bounds extend to settings with epistemic uncertainty modeled via credal sets.
- Identifies challenges in directly extending proofs, including validity of steps like union bounds over credal sets.
- Proposes some initial options to generalize key assumptions like realizability.
- Discusses open questions around extending analysis to infinite spaces and developing appropriate concentration inequalities.
- Lays groundwork for building a statistical learning theory that makes fewer assumptions about distribution drift/uncertainty.

In summary, the paper takes a first step towards robustifying statistical learning theory concepts to settings with epistemic uncertainty over distributions. It examines challenges in this generalization through the lens of generalization bounds proofs for the finite realizable case.
