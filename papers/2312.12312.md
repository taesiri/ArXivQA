# [Bioinspired Soft Robotics: state of the art, challenges, and future   directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12312)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Soft robots, defined as systems that use the inherent or structural compliance of construction materials to actively interact with the environment, have great potential for safe human interaction and operation in unstructured environments. However, replicating the efficient actuation mechanisms found in biological systems remains challenging.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper reviews the state of the art in bioinspired soft robotics across three key areas - actuation approaches, soft robot functions like locomotion and manipulation, and modeling/control strategies.

Actuation Approaches:
- Both tethered (requiring external power) and untethered actuator designs are discussed. Tethered actuators like cable-driven systems, pneumatic/hydraulic networks, and dielectric elastomer actuators offer high power but are limited by tubing/wires. 
- Untethered designs like shape memory alloys and polymers, twisted/coiled polymers, and ionic polymer metal composites provide unique stimuli response and system simplicity but can lack power and speed.

Soft Robot Functions:
- Locomotion strategies like crawling, rolling, and flapping flight are reviewed, showing how soft materials can traverse irregular terrain by exploiting compliance and deformation.
- Grasping and manipulation designs are covered spanning from pneumatic networks to tendon-driven systems to novel electroactive polymer actuators, enabling more delicate environmental interaction.

Modeling/Control:  
- Common modeling techniques like finite element methods, piecewise constant curvature, and Cosserat rod models are outlined. These enable simulation of soft robotics systems and serve as a basis for developing control methodologies.
- Control methods ranging from basic PD control to principles of optimal control are discussed, though implementation is still limited by actuator capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive single source reviewing the current state and trajectory of bioinspired soft robotics spanning actuation materials, robot functionality, modeling approaches, and controls.
- Discussion of key tradeoffs in both tethered and untethered actuator designs in context of generating forces/strains found in natural muscle systems. 
- Outlining of broad functional capabilities enabled by soft robotics as well as modeling/control techniques underlying many systems, which serve as basis for more advanced controllers limited by actuator development.
