# [Model-Agnostic Gender Debiased Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03693)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we mitigate gender bias amplification in image captioning models by considering both context->gender bias and gender->context bias? The key points are:- Image captioning models tend to amplify gender bias present in training datasets, leading to issues like incorrect gender prediction and use of gender stereotypes. - The authors identify two main types of gender bias that affect captioning models:    1) Context->gender bias: Exploiting context to incorrectly predict gender    2) Gender->context bias: Associating gender with stereotypical words- Prior work has focused only on mitigating context->gender bias, but this can increase gender->context bias. - The authors propose a model-agnostic framework called LIBRA to mitigate both types of bias by:    - Synthetically generating biased captions with the two types of bias (Biased Caption Synthesis)    - Training a model to remove the bias from those synthetic captions (Debiasing Caption Generator)- Experiments show LIBRA reduces both context->gender and gender->context bias across various captioning models, correcting gender misclassification and stereotypical word usage.In summary, the central hypothesis is that considering both types of gender bias is necessary to effectively mitigate gender bias amplification in image captioning. LIBRA provides a model-agnostic approach to do this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a model-agnostic framework called LIBRA to mitigate gender bias amplification in image captioning models. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Identifying two types of gender biases that affect image captioning models: (1) context → gender bias, where models exploit context to incorrectly predict gender, and (2) gender → context bias, where models generate biased, stereotypical words based on predicted gender.- Proposing a Biased Caption Synthesis module to intentionally create biased captions containing the two types of gender biases. This is done by swapping gender words based on sentence classification, and using T5 masked language model to generate biased captions.- Developing a Debiasing Caption Generator that is trained on the synthetic biased captions to mitigate the biases and recover the original caption. This generator can be applied on top of any existing captioning model.- Demonstrating through extensive experiments that LIBRA reduces both types of gender biases in various captioning models without hurting caption quality. It also outperforms prior debiasing methods.In summary, the key contribution is developing a novel model-agnostic framework to mitigate two major types of gender biases in image captioning by leveraging intentionally generated biased captions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on mitigating gender bias in image captioning:- It proposes there are two main types of gender bias that affect captioning models - context->gender bias and gender->context bias. Prior work has mostly focused on just one type. Looking at both provides a more comprehensive view.- It presents a new model-agnostic framework called LIBRA to mitigate both types of bias. This is different from prior work like the Gender Equalizer which requires retraining the captioning model itself. Being model-agnostic is advantageous. - The biased caption synthesis module is novel. It uses a classifier and language model to intentionally create new biased captions to train the debiasing model, unlike just using the original biased dataset. - Experiments show LIBRA is effective at reducing gender bias across multiple metrics and several state-of-the-art captioning models. Many prior methods were only tested on one or two models.- The analysis examines both bias metrics and caption quality metrics. Some prior work looked primarily at bias reduction but didn't consider impacts on caption quality.Overall, this work provides a thorough characterization and new model-agnostic approach to reducing multiple types of gender bias in image captioning. The biased data synthesis and extensive experiments on multiple models also help advance the state of the art in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest include:- Extending the framework to mitigate other types of bias beyond gender bias, such as racial bias or age bias. The paper focuses on mitigating gender bias specifically, but notes that adapting the framework to address other attributes would be an important direction.- Developing more direct metrics to evaluate context-to-gender (\ctog) bias specifically, rather than relying only on the gender misclassification rate (Error). The authors note Error does not directly measure \ctog bias.- Enabling the framework to generate more gender-neutral words like "person" when there is insufficient evidence in the image to determine gender. This could further reduce reliance on using context to predict gender.- Applying the framework to other vision-and-language tasks beyond just image captioning, to mitigate societal bias issues in those areas as well. - Collecting better captioning datasets with more diversity and balance in the data distributions, to have less inherent bias in the training data itself.- Considering how best to balance mitigating gender bias while still generating high quality and human-like captions. There is a tradeoff between debiasing and naturalness that needs further study.So in summary, extending the framework to other types of bias, developing better bias evaluation metrics, reducing reliance on context for predicting gender, applying the approach to other tasks, improving training data, and studying the tradeoffs with caption quality seem to be some of the key future directions identified. The framework shows promise for mitigating gender bias in image captioning as a first step.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a model-agnostic framework called LIBRA to mitigate gender bias amplification in image captioning models. The framework consists of two main components: 1) Biased Caption Synthesis (BCS), which synthesizes gender-biased captions containing context->gender or gender->context biases, and 2) Debiasing Caption Generator (DCG), which is trained on the synthetic biased captions to recover the original non-biased captions. DCG uses an encoder-decoder architecture to take as input a biased caption and image, and generate a debiased caption. Extensive experiments show that applying the trained DCG module on top of various image captioning models reduces gender misclassification errors and generation of gender-stereotypical words in the captions. The proposed LIBRA framework is model-agnostic and does not require retraining the underlying captioning models. The results demonstrate that considering both context->gender and gender->context biases is important for mitigating gender bias amplification in image captioning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a model-agnostic framework called LIBRA to mitigate gender bias amplification in image captioning models. Image captioning models are known to not only reproduce gender bias present in training datasets but also amplify it, resulting in more biased captions compared to human annotations. The authors hypothesize there are two types of gender bias affecting captioning models: 1) context->gender bias, where models exploit contextual cues like objects or scenes that correlate with a certain gender to predict gender words, even when incorrect, and 2) gender->context bias, where models generate gender-stereotypical words conditioned on the predicted gender. To mitigate both types of bias, LIBRA consists of two main components. First, a Biased Caption Synthesis module intentionally creates synthetic captions with increased gender bias of both types from original less biased captions. Second, a Debiasing Caption Generator is trained on the synthetic biased captions paired with original images to recover the original less biased captions. At test time, the Debiasing Caption Generator takes as input images and captions from any pretrained captioning model to output debiased captions. Experiments across various captioning models and metrics show LIBRA can substantially reduce both context->gender and gender->context bias while maintaining caption quality. The model-agnostic approach does not require retraining the captioning models themselves.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a framework called LIBRA (modeL-agnostIc deBiasing fRAmework) to mitigate gender bias amplification in image captioning models. LIBRA consists of two main modules - Biased Caption Synthesis (BCS) and Debiasing Caption Generator (DCG). BCS synthesizes gender-biased captions by exploiting context->gender bias using a gender classifier and gender->context bias using masked token prediction by T5. DCG is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model trained to recover original captions from synthetically biased captions generated by BCS. Once trained, DCG takes as input the generated caption from any captioning model along with the image, masks some words in the input caption, and generates a debiased caption to mitigate gender biases. The main advantage of LIBRA is it is model-agnostic and can be used on top of any existing captioning model without retraining the model itself. Extensive experiments show LIBRA reduces gender bias amplification in terms of various bias metrics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of gender bias amplification in image captioning models. Specifically, it focuses on mitigating two types of gender biases:1) Context -> Gender (C->G) bias: Models exploit context like image content and precedently generated words to incorrectly predict gender. 2) Gender -> Context (G->C) bias: Models generate gender-stereotypical words conditioned on the gender.The key question the paper tries to answer is: How can we mitigate both types of gender biases in image captioning models in a model-agnostic way, without needing to retrain the captioning models?The paper proposes a framework called LIBRA to address this question. LIBRA has two main components:1) Biased Caption Synthesis (BCS): Synthesizes biased captions with C->G and/or G->C biases.2) Debiasing Caption Generator (DCG): Trained on biased captions from BCS to generate debiased captions. Once trained, DCG can be applied on top of any captioning model to mitigate gender biases in a model-agnostic way, without retraining the models.In summary, the key problem is mitigating two types of gender biases in image captioning models without needing to modify the models themselves. LIBRA provides a model-agnostic approach to debiasing by learning to "translate" biased to debiased captions.
