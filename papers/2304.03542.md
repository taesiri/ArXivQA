# [Better "CMOS" Produces Clearer Images: Learning Space-Variant Blur   Estimation for Blind Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03542)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to effectively estimate space-variant blur for blind image super-resolution. The key hypotheses are:

1) Semantic information can help improve the accuracy of estimating space-variant blur, especially near the boundaries between regions with different blur amounts. 

2) Explicitly modeling the interactions between the blur and semantic modalities through a proposed Grouping Interactive Attention (GIA) module can enable them to complement each other while avoiding inconsistent guidance.

3) Training on images with realistic space-variant blur is crucial for good generalization performance to real-world images.

To validate these hypotheses, the authors propose a new Cross-MOdal fuSion (CMOS) network that jointly predicts blur and semantics in a mutually supervised manner. They also introduce two new datasets with space-variant blur to support training and evaluation. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CMOS framework over existing state-of-the-art blind SR methods.
