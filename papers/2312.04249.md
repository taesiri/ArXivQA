# [Extending Answer Set Programming with Rational Numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04249)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an extension of the Answer Set Programming (ASP) language to support rational numbers, aiming to enhance its applicability in real-world contexts that require non-integer arithmetic. The authors formally define the syntax and semantics of ASP-Core-2 extended with rational terms, ensuring a well-founded model-theoretic characterization. They discuss relevant implementation aspects, such as ensuring invariance under undefined arithmetic and compatibility with existing ASP systems. To showcase the viability of their proposal, the authors provide an implementation in the I-DLV grounder, which can interface with mainstream ASP solvers that adhere to the standard lparse numeric format. By supporting exact rational number calculations, their work overcomes inaccuracies of commonly adopted approximations and improves declarativity compared to impure extensions relying on external functions. The authors argue that handling rational terms natively within pure ASP facilitates modeling and increases versatility for applications, while retaining a finite Herbrand universe. They hope this effort constitutes a first step towards more expressive ASP languages able to handle real-world problems involving non-integer data.
