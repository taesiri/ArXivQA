# [Extending Answer Set Programming with Rational Numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04249)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an extension of the Answer Set Programming (ASP) language to support rational numbers, aiming to enhance its applicability in real-world contexts that require non-integer arithmetic. The authors formally define the syntax and semantics of ASP-Core-2 extended with rational terms, ensuring a well-founded model-theoretic characterization. They discuss relevant implementation aspects, such as ensuring invariance under undefined arithmetic and compatibility with existing ASP systems. To showcase the viability of their proposal, the authors provide an implementation in the I-DLV grounder, which can interface with mainstream ASP solvers that adhere to the standard lparse numeric format. By supporting exact rational number calculations, their work overcomes inaccuracies of commonly adopted approximations and improves declarativity compared to impure extensions relying on external functions. The authors argue that handling rational terms natively within pure ASP facilitates modeling and increases versatility for applications, while retaining a finite Herbrand universe. They hope this effort constitutes a first step towards more expressive ASP languages able to handle real-world problems involving non-integer data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an extension of Answer Set Programming to support rational numbers, providing a well-defined semantics and an implementation in the I-DLV system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Defining a new version of the ASP-Core-2 language that includes rational numbers, formalizing its syntax and semantics. This allows ASP programs to reason with non-integer numbers in a declarative manner while still having a well-defined semantics.

2) Discussing implementation aspects to take into account when adapting an ASP system to support rational terms, such as safety, range/modulus operators, undefined arithmetics, number of decimal digits, and compatibility with the standard intermediate numeric format used by ASP solvers.

3) Providing an implementation in the I-DLV grounder that supports the proposed ASP extension with rational terms. This allows combining I-DLV with existing ASP solvers to obtain systems capable of handling non-integers. Mathematical builtins operating on rational terms are also included.

In summary, the main contribution is conceiving an ASP language extension to handle non-integer numbers, by relying on rational terms, along with a practical implementation and guidelines to realize other compatible systems. This can serve as a first step towards more expressive ASP languages able to model a wider range of real-world problems requiring numeric computations beyond integers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that extending ASP with rational numbers enhances explainability. Can you elaborate on the connection between support for rational numbers and explainability in ASP? What specifically does this extension allow one to explain that was not possible before?

2. The paper claims that adding rational number support significantly broadens the application domains for ASP compared to integers only. Can you give some examples of specific domains or applications where rational number support would be critical? 

3. The semantics outlined in the paper relies on the standard form for rational numbers. What is the rationale behind using the standard form? How does this choice impact efficiency and reproducibility in practice?

4. The paper leaves range and modulus operators restricted to integers. What challenges would arise if they were extended to rational numbers? Could these challenges be addressed in some way to enable broader usage of these operators?

5. Safety in ASP rules ensures grounding remains finite. How does the addition of rational numbers impact safety considerations? Do additional safety restrictions need to be put in place?

6. The proposal requires programs to be invariant under undefined arithmetic. Can you walk through this requirement and explain why it is important in the context of rational number support?

7. The lparse format required updates to enable rational number support. Can you summarize the key changes that were needed and why existing representations were insufficient? 

8. External functions like pow and abs are defined over rational numbers. What implementation challenges arise in correctly and efficiently supporting such functions?

9. How does the choice of maximum number of decimal digits influence reproducibility and semantics? What tradeoffs does this introduce between precision and practicality?

10. Could the approach taken in this work be extended to support irrational numbers like π or the square root of 2? What theoretical and implementation barriers exist there?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular declarative programming paradigm used in AI for knowledge representation and reasoning. However, it lacks native support for non-integer numbers, which limits its applicability for real-world problems requiring smooth numeric calculations.  
- Extending ASP with non-integers is non-trivial since floating point numbers can lead to irreproducible and non-declarative results. Other logic programming languages like Prolog and Constraint Logic Programming already handle non-integers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an extension of the ASP-Core-2 language to incorporate rational number terms, while retaining ASP's declarative semantics.
- The syntax allows rationals as fractions or decimals. The semantics handles mathematical operations on rationals correctly using least common multiples and greatest common divisors. This ensures closure, precision and reproducibility.
- Several technical aspects are discussed like safety, handling undefined operations, limiting range/modulus operators to integers, specifying number of decimal digits kept, and updates to the standard numeric format used by ASP grounders.

Contributions:
- Formalization of syntax and declarative semantics for ASP-Core-2 extended with rational terms.
- Discussion of relevant implementation concerns for supporting rational arithmetic.
- A new version of the ASP grounder I-DLV which implements the proposed language, compatible with standard ASP solvers. It supports configurable decimal precision and mathematical functions over rational terms.

Overall, the paper presents a novel extension to increase the expressiveness of ASP for real-world problems, while retaining its declarative nature. The provision of an implementation and integration with existing toolchain is valuable for adoption.
