# [NewsBench: Systematic Evaluation of LLMs for Writing Proficiency and   Safety Adherence in Chinese Journalistic Editorial Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00862)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: There is a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate the capabilities and risks of large language models (LLMs) in producing journalistic content that complies with media ethics and safety standards. This limits the responsible adoption of LLMs in journalistic applications.

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces NewsBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework to evaluate LLMs' Chinese journalistic writing proficiency and safety adherence across diverse editorial applications (headline generation, summarization, continuation writing, expansion writing, style refinement), aspects (4 writing quality facets and 6 safety facets), and news domains.

Key Components:
- 1267 Chinese testing tasks spanning multiple formats (open-ended generation and multiple-choice) 
- Automatic evaluation protocols using GPT-4 models, validated via human assessment
- Analysis of 11 LLMs highlighting strengths and weaknesses in writing quality and safety

Main Contributions:
- Developed the first tailored benchmark for systematically assessing Chinese LLMs in journalism 
- Identified top models GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot, while uncovering deficiencies in ethical adherence
- Offered recommendations to enhance LLMs' news writing abilities and align them with journalistic responsibilities  

The paper makes an important step towards promoting the safe, ethical and effective integration of LLMs into news workflows through comprehensive capability and risk evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces NewsBench, a novel benchmark to evaluate large language models' capabilities in Chinese journalistic writing proficiency and safety adherence across editorial applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It develops NewsBench, a novel benchmark framework for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Chinese journalistic writing proficiency and safety adherence. NewsBench features tasks across 5 editorial applications, 7 aspects (4 writing facets + 6 safety facets), 2 task formats (generation & multiple-choice), spanning 24 news domains.

2. It introduces two automatic evaluation protocols using GPT-4 to assess LLMs' journalistic writing proficiency and safety compliance in generated content. These protocols are validated through human evaluation. 

3. It conducts a comparative assessment of 11 LLMs using NewsBench, identifying GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot as top performers. The analysis also reveals deficiencies of current LLMs in maintaining journalistic ethics during creative writing.

4. The benchmark framework and evaluation results provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in journalistic applications. The findings underscore the need to enhance ethical guidance in AI-generated journalistic content.

In summary, the key contribution is the development of a specialized benchmark (NewsBench) to evaluate LLMs' capabilities and risks regarding writing quality, safety, and ethics in Chinese journalistic contexts, advancing efforts to ensure responsible AI use.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- NewsBench - The name of the benchmark framework developed to evaluate LLMs on Chinese journalistic writing proficiency and safety adherence.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The AI models being evaluated, such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, ERNIE Bot.

- Journalistic writing proficiency (JWP) - One of the two principal evaluation criteria focused on assessing quality of writing.

- Safety adherence (SA) - The other main evaluation criteria related to adhering to journalistic ethics and safety standards. 

- Editorial applications - The paper evaluated performance across 5 common applications like headline generation, text summarization, continuation of writing.

- Evaluation protocols - Two automatic evaluation methods devised using GPT-4 to score generated content on writing proficiency and safety adherence.

- Error analysis - Analysis undertaken to identify strengths, weaknesses and challenges faced by models on specific tasks.

- GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot - Identified as top performing models, but still facing some limitations in creative writing scenarios.

The key focus is on developing a specialized benchmark to systematically assess LLMs' capabilities and risks pertaining to Chinese journalistic writing and safety considerations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces two automatic evaluation protocols for assessing journalistic writing proficiency and safety adherence of LLM-generated content. Could you elaborate on the methodology behind devising these protocols? What validation process was undertaken?

2. NewsBench incorporates both generative, open-ended questions as well as multiple-choice questions. What is the rationale behind using both question formats? What are the relative strengths and weaknesses?  

3. The paper identifies 4 key aspects that comprise overall journalistic writing proficiency - language fluency, logical coherence, style alignment and instruction fulfillment. Why were these specific 4 facets selected? How do they combine to provide a holistic assessment?

4. For the journalistic writing proficiency protocol, weighted scoring rubrics are defined across the 4 aspects, with values from 0-3 assigned. What considerations dictated this scoring scale and weight distribution? How was the rubric formulated?

5. The safety adherence protocol assesses 6 distinct aspects as binary pass/fail criteria. What factors led to a binary rather than scored evaluation? And how might a more nuanced, scored assessment be constructed?

6. Why does the benchmark focus solely on the editorial phase of journalism and exclude preceding and succeeding stages like ideation and recommendation? What modifications could broaden applicability?  

7. Error analysis revealed particular weaknesses of models in task categories like writing expansion and continuation. Why might these generative applications prove more problematic? How can models be improved?

8. The paper identifies strengths of top models like GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot in most categories but deficiencies in ethical adherence for creative writing. Why is ethical compliance tougher to enforce during generative tasks?

9. How scalable and extensible is the benchmark dataset of 1267 labeled examples across multiple dimensions? What plans exist to expand dataset size and dimensionality moving forward?

10. The automated assessment protocols are reliant solely on innate LLM capabilities. How could integration of external knowledge sources to enable things like fact-checking improve evaluation fidelity and comprehensiveness?
