# [TURNA: A Turkish Encoder-Decoder Language Model for Enhanced   Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14373)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in NLP have favored English-centric models, resulting in a gap for low-resource languages like Turkish.  
- Existing multilingual models don't perform well on language-specific tasks requiring nuanced understanding.
- Turkish has encoder-only models but lacks large-scale models for both understanding and generation tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a Turkish encoder-decoder model called TURNA based on the UL2 framework that is pretrained on a diverse 43B token corpus.

Key Contributions:
- Release of TURNA - first unified Turkish LM capable of both understanding and generation with 1.1B parameters.
- Evaluation on 13 datasets over 8 tasks shows TURNA outperforms multilingual models and competes with monolingual Turkish models on understanding.  
- Make publicly available - the model, data collection/filtering code, training code, and fine-tuning code to facilitate benchmarking.

Main Results:
- TURNA outperforms mT5 and mBART on all generation tasks tested - paraphrasing, summarization and title generation.
- On understanding tasks, TURNA outperforms mT5 and mBART across all tasks.  
- TURNA's encoder TURNA-Encoder matches or exceeds monolingual BERTurk on most understanding tasks, showing efficiency gains.
- Analysis identifies potential for further pretraining and task-specific hyperparameter tuning to maximize performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces TURNA, a new 1.1B parameter Turkish language model with an encoder-decoder architecture, pre-trained on a diverse 43B token corpus and demonstrating strong performance on a range of natural language understanding and generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The release of \turna, the first unified language model capable of both understanding and generation tasks in Turkish. It is the largest of its kind with 1.1B parameters and is trained on a diverse corpus of ~43B tokens.

2) The evaluation of \turna on 13 datasets across 8 tasks, showing it surpasses multilingual models and performs better than or on par with BERTurk (a Turkish monolingual encoder-only model) in understanding tasks. 

3) The public release of the source code for data collection, filtering, model training, and fine-tuning to facilitate further research and benchmarking in Turkish NLP.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Turna - The name of the Turkish language model introduced in the paper. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and is pretrained using the UL2 framework's Mixture-of-Denoisers objective.

- Low-resource language - The paper focuses on developing models for low-resource languages like Turkish, which lack the abundant training data that English has. 

- Encoder-decoder model - Turna uses an encoder-decoder architecture so it can perform both understanding and generation tasks.

- Pretraining objectives - The paper discusses different pretraining objectives like denoising, causal language modeling, and the Mixture-of-Denoisers used by Turna.

- Fine-tuning - The process of adapting a pretrained model like Turna to downstream tasks by continuing training on task-specific datasets.

- Natural language understanding (NLU) - Language understanding tasks that involve extracting meaning, like text classification and named entity recognition.

- Natural language generation (NLG) - Language generation tasks that involve producing text, like summarization and paraphrasing.

- Multilingual models - Models like mT5 and mBART that are trained on multiple languages. Compared as baselines.

- BERTurk - A Turkish BERT model used as a monolingual baseline for comparison.

So in summary, the key terms cover the introduced model, its architecture and pretraining, the languages and tasks involved, and the baseline models used for comparison.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using the Unified Language Learning (UL2) framework and its Mixture of Denoisers (MoD) pretraining objective. Can you explain in more detail how the MoD objective works and what the different denoisers (R-denoising, S-denoising, X-denoising) entail? 

2. The model architecture uses an encoder-decoder setup based on T5. What are the specific architectural choices, such as number of layers, attention heads, embedding dimensions etc. and what was the reasoning behind some of these choices?

3. The paper curates a diverse pretraining corpus from multiple sources like web data, scientific articles, books etc. Can you elaborate on the cleaning strategies used for the scientific articles corpus and how line-wise filtering was implemented?  

4. During pretraining, samples are selected from different datasets based on specific proportions. What are these proportions and what was the rationale behind assigning these percentages to different datasets?

5. The results show that Turna outperforms multilingual models on several tasks. Can you analyze some of the possible reasons it is able to achieve better performance compared to mT5 and mBART?

6. For understanding tasks, Turna lags behind BERTurk on some datasets. What modifications were made to create Turna-Encoder to improve efficiency for understanding tasks? Did this bridge the gap with BERTurk?

7. The paper mentions under-training as a potential limitation inhibiting Turna from fully leveraging its parameters. What solutions have been proposed to mitigate this issue and further scale up the model? 

8. Mode switching with different sentinel tokens produced inconsistent results across tasks. What could be some potential reasons for why a particular token improved performance on some tasks but not others?

9. Can you think of some additional strategies that could be used during data filtering of the scientific corpus to further enhance quality?

10. The model uses a predefined tokenizer provided by VNGRS-AI. What modifications could be explored with regards to tokenization and vocabulary to potentially boost model performance?
