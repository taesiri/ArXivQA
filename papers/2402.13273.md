# [Operational Collective Intelligence of Humans and Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13273)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Operational scenarios (sequences of events with defined agents, components and interactions) rely on input from human and machine intelligence. However, agents often have access to unique information that biases their judgments.  
- Typical collective intelligence approaches like wisdom of the crowds can fail in adversarial reasoning scenarios where crowd knowledge becomes biased.
- Aggregative crowdsourced forecasting (ACF) combines predictions and rationales from a diverse crowd along with machine learning aggregation, but has not been applied to operational scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- Explore using ACF to operationalize "collective intelligence" for operational scenarios and decision-making. 
- ACF could provide new capabilities like listening to the most knowledgeable agents, adapting to unpredictable situations by recognizing underspecified machine intelligence, and increasing decision speed.

Key Contributions:
- Identify key research questions on viability of ACF for operational impact, including determinants of practicality, human factors, and machine intelligence factors.
- Review relevant existing work like the SAGE and MATRICS hybrid intelligence systems.
- Discuss potential impacts of operational collective intelligence, including improved decision accuracy, ability to adapt to anomalies, and increased decision speed.  
- Analyze advantages around integrating human and machine intelligence, as well as practicality considerations around data, modeling, and human factors.

In summary, the paper proposes using ACF to achieve operational collective intelligence, analyzes determinants of success, reviews related work, and discusses potential impacts. Key challenges are data, modeling, and human factors. If these can be addressed, ACF could provide new operational capabilities.
