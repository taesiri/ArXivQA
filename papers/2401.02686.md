# [Beyond Fidelity: Explaining Vulnerability Localization of Learning-based   Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02686)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning based vulnerability detectors can effectively detect vulnerabilities but struggle to precisely locate the specific vulnerable code lines. Explanation methods have been used to highlight important features to improve localization. 

- However, there lacks a systematic evaluation of explanation methods for vulnerability detection. Specifically, relying solely on the fidelity metric to evaluate explanation methods can be insufficient.

- Through an illustrative example, the authors show several explanation methods fail to identify known vulnerable lines, raising questions on their reliability.

Methodology:
- The authors evaluate 10 explanation methods on 7 deep learning based vulnerability detectors using graph and sequence representations of code. The detectors are assessed on the SARD and Fan benchmarks. 

- Beyond fidelity, new metrics are introduced - vulnerability line coverage rate and its two sub-metrics - to evaluate if explanations capture vulnerability-relevant code.

- Further experiments are designed to evaluate if detectors learn artifacts unrelated to vulnerabilities and their ability to recognize unseen vulnerability fixing patterns.

Key Findings:
- Explanation methods exhibit varying fidelity scores across detectors and datasets. High fidelity does not necessarily mean explanations are vulnerability-relevant.

- All explanation methods perform poorly in identifying vulnerability triggering and fixing code lines, with coverage rates much below expectations.

- Detectors are susceptible to label-flipping perturbations unrelated to vulnerabilities. They likely learn artifacts distinguishing vulnerable/non-vulnerable code rather than comprehending vulnerability causes.

- Detectors fail to recognize previously unseen fixing patterns, indicating they do not fully understand vulnerability semantics.

Main Contributions:
- Enhanced evaluation of explainers using coverage rate metrics beyond fidelity
- Revealing limitations of vulnerability detectors in capturing semantics
- Identifying reliability concerns with current explainers for vulnerability detection
- New metric (VUR) to assess detector susceptibility to unrelated perturbations

The paper systematically assesses challenges around the use of explainers to improve vulnerability localization, providing valuable insights to guide future research towards more reliable solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper evaluates explanation methods for deep learning-based vulnerability detectors, finding limitations in their ability to accurately localize vulnerabilities due to both deficiencies in the explainers themselves as well as the detectors learning artifacts unrelated to vulnerabilities rather than genuinely comprehending vulnerability semantics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes enhanced evaluation metrics beyond fidelity to assess the performance of explanation methods for deep learning-based vulnerability detectors. Specifically, it introduces the Vulnerability Line Coverage rate (LC) metric with two sub-metrics - Vulnerability-Triggering Code Line Coverage rate (TLC) and Vulnerability-Fixing Code Line Coverage rate (FLC). These provide a more nuanced understanding of how well explainers identify vulnerability-related code.

2. Through extensive experiments, the paper reveals limitations of current deep learning vulnerability detectors - they tend to learn artifacts unrelated to vulnerabilities and are susceptible to irrelevant perturbations that can flip predictions. This calls into question their reliability.

3. The paper provides insights into limitations of existing explanation approaches as well. It shows that high fidelity scores do not necessarily mean explanations capture vulnerability-critical information. The poor TLC and FLC scores indicate explainers struggle to accurately pinpoint vulnerability statements.  

4. To complement evaluation metrics for detectors, the paper introduces a new metric - Vulnerability Unrelated Ratio (VUR) that focuses on the impact of unrelated perturbations. Results show all detectors are affected by such perturbations to varying extents.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous evaluation study that reveals deficiencies in both deep learning-based vulnerability detectors and explanation methods in accurately recognizing and explaining vulnerabilities. The paper proposes enhanced metrics to expose these limitations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Vulnerability detection - The paper focuses on evaluating explanation methods for deep learning-based vulnerability detectors. Vulnerability detection is the main application area.

- Explainability/interpretability - The paper examines various explanation approaches like LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, etc. and evaluates their effectiveness in explaining predictions of vulnerability detectors.

- Fidelity - One of the key metrics used to evaluate how well an explanation method captures the importance of features identified by the detector model.

- Coverage rate - Introduced as an additional evaluation metric beyond fidelity that measures the relevance of explanations to actual vulnerabilities. Two sub-metrics are triggering code line coverage (TLC) and fixing code line coverage (FLC).

- Artifacts - The paper finds that vulnerability detectors may learn certain artifacts or patterns not inherently related to vulnerabilities, which can impact explanation effectiveness. 

- Perturbation analysis - Techniques like GNNExplainer that rely on perturbing inputs to understand feature importance are found to have limitations in evaluating vulnerability detectors.

- Dataset quality - The quality and accuracy of vulnerability datasets, regarding labeling of vulnerable code lines, is found to significantly impact detector and explainer performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper introduces two new metrics, Vulnerability-Triggering Code Line Coverage rate (TLC) and Vulnerability-Fixing Code Line Coverage rate (FLC), to evaluate the ability of explanation methods to identify vulnerability-related code. Can you elaborate on why fidelity alone was not sufficient, and the need for additional metrics like TLC and FLC?

2. The paper finds that none of the explanation methods effectively localize vulnerabilities even when achieving high fidelity scores. What are some potential reasons behind the poor correlation observed between fidelity scores and the ability to pinpoint vulnerability statements?  

3. The Vulnerability Unrelated Ratio (VUR) is proposed in the paper to quantify the susceptibility of models to perturbations unrelated to vulnerabilities. Can you explain the formulation behind VUR and how it aided the analysis regarding suitability of fidelity as an evaluation metric?

4. The paper observes decreased fidelity scores for certain explanation methods on the retrained models compared to the previous models, despite improved localization of vulnerability fixing lines. What might be the reasons behind this contradictory observation?

5. The significant drop in accuracy of detectors when evaluated on manually corrected vulnerability samples versus original corrected samples indicates their inability to recognize previously unseen fixing patterns. What are the implications of this observation regarding the comprehension of vulnerability semantics by current detectors?

6. This paper identifies certain limitations of binary classification based deep learning vulnerability detectors - can you summarize what the key limitations identified are and why the paper suggests subdividing vulnerability detection into multiple sub-tasks?

7. The paper introduces the notion of using a balanced sub-dataset to retrain models and analyze performance of explanation methods. What was the motivation behind using a balanced dataset and how did it aid in the analysis?

8. What might be potential reasons behind the variability in performance of the same explanation method when applied to different datasets and detectors? 

9. The paper identifies certain text features capable of triggering false positives and misclassifications in certain detectors like DeepWuKong. What does this indicate regarding their reliance on textual patterns versus comprehending vulnerabilities?

10. What are some promising future directions suggested in the paper regarding vulnerability detection using deep learning models? How can leveraging recent advances in language models mitigate certain limitations identified?
