# [Improving Medical Report Generation with Adapter Tuning and Knowledge   Enhancement in Vision-Language Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03970)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Medical-Adapted and Knowledge-Enhanced Network (MAKEN) to address the challenging task of medical report generation from medical images. MAKEN builds upon the state-of-the-art BLIP-2 vision-language model and introduces two key innovations - adapter tuning of the image encoder for efficient adaptation to the medical domain, and a medical knowledge enhancement loss to improve assimilation of medical terminology. Specifically, lightweight adapters are inserted between layers of the image encoder, enabling continuous learning of effective features for medical report generation while preserving useful pre-trained knowledge. The medical knowledge loss assigns higher weights to rare medical terms based on their frequencies, guiding the model to accurately generate professional medical concepts. Validation on the ImageCLEFmedical 2023 dataset shows MAKEN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in metrics like ROUGE and CIDEr that evaluate content quality. Qualitative examples demonstrate MAKEN's ability to produce coherent, comprehensive and precise medical captions covering abnormal findings. The robust performance despite scarce labelled data highlights the efficacy of MAKEN's efficient domain adaptation techniques for integrating vision-language foundation models to address medical report generation.
