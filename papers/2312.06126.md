# [Spreeze: High-Throughput Parallel Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06126)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Spreeze, a novel high-throughput parallel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that maximizes the utilization of hardware resources on a single desktop computer to achieve efficient and accelerated RL training. The key innovations include fully asynchronous parallelization of experience sampling, network updates, performance evaluation, and visualization using multiple processes; efficient transmission of experience data via shared memory and network weights via solid-state drive; automated hyperparameter adaptation to optimize resource usage; and actor-critic model parallelism for dual GPU training. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art throughput - 15,000Hz sampling and 370,000Hz network update rate using a 12-core CPU and single GPU desktop, reducing average training time by 73% across tasks compared to existing frameworks. The work provides methods to fully exploit single desktop capabilities as a prerequisite for distributed training, moving towards more extensive, practical, and efficient large-scale RL.
