# [PlayFusion: Skill Acquisition via Diffusion from Language-Annotated Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04549)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes PlayFusion, a method to learn goal-directed robotic skills from unlabeled and unstructured "play" data, which is easier to collect but more noisy than traditional supervised datasets. PlayFusion uses a conditional denoising diffusion model to generate diverse and multimodal robotic behaviors by iterative denoising of the play data conditioned on language annotations provided in hindsight. To encourage the model to acquire discrete and meaningful skills, PlayFusion introduces vector quantization bottlenecks into both the language conditioning pathway as well as the diffusion model itself. Experiments across simulated environments like CALVIN, Franka Kitchen, and Ravens as well as three real-world manipulation setups demonstrate PlayFusion's effectiveness at extracting skills and generalizing to novel instructions. The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches for learning behaviors from play across the board. A key advantage is the ability to handle noisy, diverse data and convert it into useful skills. The discrete bottlenecks allow for better generalization and interpolation between known skills.
