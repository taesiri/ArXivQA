# Self-Supervised Bot Play for Conversational Recommendation with   Justifications

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop an effective conversational recommender system that can justify its suggestions, adapt recommendations based on user feedback, and be trained without requiring large amounts of crowd-sourced dialog data? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Modeling the recommendation conversation as an expert justifying suggestions and a user critiquing subjective aspects will lead to more natural and effective interactions compared to existing approaches.2) Self-supervised bot play can be used to train a conversational recommender without crowdsourced dialog transcripts, allowing the approach to be applied to new domains. 3) Their proposed two-part training framework of pretraining a joint recommendation and justification model followed by bot play fine-tuning will outperform existing conversational recommenders in multi-turn simulated dialogs and with real users.In summary, the central research aims to develop a conversational recommender that can justify suggestions and adapt interactively without relying on large dialog datasets. The key hypotheses are around using a justification-critiquing dialog structure and a bot play training approach to achieve superior performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new two-part framework for training conversational recommender systems without requiring large collections of human dialog transcripts. The key ideas are:1. First training a model to jointly recommend items and generate justifications using sets of subjective aspects extracted from reviews. 2. Then fine-tuning the model using self-supervised bot play based on simulated conversations using the review data.The paper shows this framework can be applied to different base recommendation models (BPR and PLRec) across diverse domains. The resulting conversational agents (BPR-Bot and PLRec-Bot) outperform prior state-of-the-art methods in multi-turn conversational recommendation. Experiments and user studies demonstrate the models trained with this framework provide more useful, helpful and knowledgeable recommendations compared to alternatives.In summary, the main contribution is a new training framework to develop conversational recommender systems without needing expensive human dialog data. The framework is model-agnostic and achieves superior performance to prior methods when evaluated on real-world datasets and with human users.
