# Towards Multi-Turn Empathetic Dialogs with Positive Emotion Elicitation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop multi-turn empathetic dialog systems that can elicit positive emotions from users?Specifically, the key aspects the paper tries to address are:1) Collecting a large-scale multi-turn dialog dataset where the conversations start from any emotional state (positive, neutral or negative) and end at a positive state. This dataset can facilitate research on empathetic dialog systems that can elicit positive emotions. 2) Developing a dialog generation model that can conduct empathetic responses to understand the user's emotional state, while also guiding the conversation towards eliciting positive emotions from the user. 3) Designing suitable automatic evaluation metrics and loss functions to measure both the empathy and positive emotion elicitation capabilities of dialog models trained on this dataset.4) Demonstrating through empirical experiments that the proposed model, loss function and dataset can improve positive emotion elicitation in empathetic dialog systems, compared to prior baseline models.In summary, the core research contribution is developing the capabilities for multi-turn empathetic dialog systems to elicit positive emotions from users, by collecting a suitable dataset and developing an appropriate generation model and evaluation methodology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Presents a novel task of multi-turn empathetic dialog generation with positive emotion elicitation. In this task, the dialog agent aims to elicit positive emotions from the user through multi-turn conversations, while also expressing empathy. 2. Provides a large-scale Chinese dialog dataset called PosEmoDial with over 819k dialogs for studying this task. The dialogs start with any emotion state (positive, neutral or negative) and end with a positive emotion elicited by the agent.3. Proposes a positive-emotion-guided empathetic dialog generation model (PEGE) with a novel loss function design. The loss encourages eliciting positive emotions from the user while ensuring smooth emotional transitions during the dialog.4. Evaluates the proposed model and dataset through automatic metrics and human evaluation. Results confirm the effectiveness of the dataset and model for empathetic dialog generation with positive emotion elicitation.In summary, the key contribution is presenting a new empathetic dialog generation task focused on eliciting positive emotions, along with a large dataset, a novel model, and comprehensive evaluations towards this goal. The work provides a useful resource and benchmark for building dialog agents with emotional support capabilities.
