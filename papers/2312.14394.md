# [AdapTraj: A Multi-Source Domain Generalization Framework for Multi-Agent   Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-agent trajectory prediction is an important task for modeling interactions of objects in dynamic systems. 
- Existing methods assume training and test data come from the same distribution. However, in real-world, there exist inherent distribution shifts across domains, leading to performance degradation.
- Using trajectories from a single source domain is insufficient to capture variations for effective generalization. Directly fusing data from multiple domains causes negative transfer.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose AdapTraj, a multi-source domain generalization framework for multi-agent trajectory prediction. It serves as a plug-and-play module adaptable to various models.
- Explicitly model four types of features: domain-invariant and domain-specific features for both focal agent and neighbors. This enables leveraging knowledge from multiple domains to address negative transfer.
- Use extractors with orthogonal constraints to disentangle invariant and specific features. Employ teacher-student process for domain-specific aggregator to obtain effective domain-specific features at inference time.  
- New causal formulation considers both invariant (e.g. collision avoidance) and specific (e.g. yielding tendencies) features of neighbors.

Main Contributions:
- Identify limitations of obtaining a generalizable trajectory prediction model through experiments.
- Propose AdapTraj framework that harnesses knowledge from multiple domains and achieves better generalization via effectively modeling invariant and specific features.
- AdapTraj serves as a plug-and-play module, adaptable to variety of trajectory prediction models. 
- Extensive experiments on four distinct real-world datasets show consistent and substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
