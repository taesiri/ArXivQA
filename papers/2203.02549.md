# [Structured Pruning is All You Need for Pruning CNNs at Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02549)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can structured pruning at initialization achieve competitive accuracy compared to unstructured pruning at initialization while also being hardware friendly? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) The accuracy of CNN models pruned using pruning-at-initialization (PAI) methods depends only on the fraction of remaining parameters per layer (layer-wise density), not on which specific parameters are pruned.

2) Using a new proxy for model accuracy called Synaptic Expectation (SynExp), PAI can be formulated as a convex optimization problem that directly solves for the optimal layer-wise density. 

3) Based on this formulation, a structured PAI method called PreCrop that prunes models in the channel dimension can achieve accuracy comparable to unstructured PAI methods.

4) A variant called PreConfig can further optimize the channel width of each layer to improve accuracy at almost zero cost compared to standard neural architecture search techniques.

The paper seems to experimentally validate these hypotheses by comparing PreCrop and PreConfig against state-of-the-art unstructured PAI methods like SynFlow on modern CNN architectures and datasets. The key result appears to be that structured pruning via PreCrop/PreConfig can match or exceed the accuracy of SynFlow while also being hardware friendly.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new pruning-at-initialization (PAI) method called Structured Pruning is All You Need for Pruning CNNs at Initialization. The main contributions are:

- They propose to use the expectation of the sum of importance scores, rather than the sum, as a proxy for model accuracy after pruning. This allows them to formulate PAI as a convex optimization problem that directly solves for the optimal layer-wise density.

- They prove a theorem that the accuracy after pruning only depends on the layer-wise density, regardless of the granularity of pruning. This opens up the possibility for coarse-grained structured pruning. 

- They propose a structured PAI method called PreCrop that prunes channels to achieve regularity. Compared to prior unstructured PAI methods like SynFlow, PreCrop achieves higher accuracy with fewer FLOPs on ImageNet.

- They propose PreConfig, which relaxes the density constraints in PreCrop, allowing layers to expand. This provides a way to tune the width of layers at almost no cost. PreConfig achieves higher accuracy than the original models using fewer parameters.

In summary, the key ideas are formulating PAI as a convex optimization problem based on a new accuracy proxy, proving that only layer-wise density matters, and proposing structured pruning methods PreCrop and PreConfig that can match or improve accuracy compared to prior unstructured PAI techniques. The overall contribution is a better structured PAI approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a structured pruning-at-initialization method called PreCrop that prunes CNN models at the channel level based on a convex optimization formulation of layer-wise density, and shows it can achieve higher accuracy than prior unstructured pruning-at-initialization techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on pruning CNNs at initialization compares to other related work:

- It proposes a new theoretical framework and metric (SynExp) for analyzing pruning-at-initialization (PAI) methods, proving an invariance theorem about layer densities. This provides new theoretical insight into why PAI methods work.

- It introduces a new structured PAI method (PreCrop) that prunes channels rather than individual weights. This makes the method more hardware-friendly than prior unstructured PAI techniques.

- Empirically, PreCrop matches or improves accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art PAI method SynFlow across various CNN architectures and datasets. For example, on ImageNet it achieves 2.7% higher accuracy for MobileNetV2.

- The paper proposes a way to optimize layer widths PreConfig as an extremely fast neural architecture search method. This allows tweaking width dimensions at near-zero cost compared to regular NAS.

- Overall, the paper provides both new theory and effective methods to understand and improve pruning of modern CNNs at initialization. The accuracy improvements, hardware-friendly structure, and ultra-fast architecture tuning help advance the state-of-the-art in efficient model compression.

Some key differences compared to prior work are the theoretical analysis framework, structured pruning approach, accuracy improvements on various models/datasets, and formulation as an ultra-fast NAS technique. The paper builds nicely on top of previous PAI research while making several notable contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different proxy functions for model accuracy in the pruning-at-initialization formulation, beyond just the expectation of the sum of importance scores. The authors mention trying other statistics like variance. 

- Applying the proposed structured pruning-at-initialization approach to additional CNN architectures beyond ResNet, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet.

- Further analysis into why the layer-wise density is the key factor determining model accuracy after pruning-at-initialization. The authors suggest theoretical analysis of how the lottery ticket hypothesis relates to their findings.

- Extending the pruning-at-initialization optimization framework to support other resource constraints beyond just FLOPs and parameter counts, like latency, memory usage, etc.

- Leveraging the ultra-fast neural architecture search enabled by PreConfig to do joint search over width, depth, and other dimensions. The authors suggest combining it with techniques like weight sharing.

- Applying the structured pruning techniques to additional domains like natural language processing and investigating their effectiveness.

- Further analysis of the tradeoffs between unstructured vs structured pruning in the context of pruning-at-initialization.

So in summary, the main future directions are exploring new proxy accuracy functions, applying the methods to new models/tasks, theoretical analysis, supporting more constraints, combining with NAS, and analysis of pruning techniques. Overall the authors suggest many interesting avenues for extending their work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a structured and hardware-friendly pruning-at-initialization (PAI) method called PreCrop to prune convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the channel dimension. The key idea is to formulate PAI as a convex optimization problem that directly solves for the optimal layer-wise density (fraction of remaining weights per layer) to maximize a newly proposed expectation-based accuracy proxy named SynExp. The paper proves theoretically that model accuracy after PAI only depends on layer-wise density regardless of pruning granularity. Based on this analysis, PreCrop solves the convex optimization to obtain the optimal layer-wise density, then prunes channels accordingly before training to provide structured sparsity. Experiments on ResNet, MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet demonstrate that PreCrop outperforms existing unstructured PAI techniques, improving accuracy by up to 2.7% on ImageNet compared to state-of-the-art SynFlow. PreCrop also enables efficient reconfiguration of layer width at near-zero cost. With similar FLOPs, reconfigured EfficientNet and MobileNetV2 achieve higher accuracy than original models using 20% fewer parameters on ImageNet. The structured channel pruning of PreCrop enables practical acceleration without sparse matrix operations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new pruning-at-initialization (PAI) method called PreGrouping that can achieve structured pruning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Existing PAI methods prune individual weights based on importance scores, but this results in irregular sparsity that is difficult to accelerate. The key idea of PreGrouping is to formulate PAI as a convex optimization problem that directly optimizes for the layer-wise density (fraction of remaining weights per layer) to maximize the expected sum of importance scores. Through an invariance theorem, the paper shows that the accuracy of a CNN pruned with PAI only depends on the layer densities, regardless of the granularity of pruning. Based on this, PreGrouping performs structured pruning by reducing the number of channels in each layer to match the optimized layer densities. 

The paper empirically evaluates PreGrouping on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using ResNet, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet architectures. The results show that PreGrouping matches or exceeds the accuracy of the state-of-the-art unstructured PAI method SynFlow, while also enabling practical acceleration through structured pruning. PreGrouping is also extended to increase model width in certain layers at nearly zero cost through a technique called PreConfig, resulting in further accuracy improvements. Overall, the paper demonstrates an effective structured PAI method with strong empirical performance across multiple modern CNN architectures and datasets.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method for structured pruning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at initialization. The main ideas are:

1) They show theoretically and empirically that for pruning-at-initialization (PAI) methods, only the layer-wise density (fraction of remaining weights per layer) matters for model accuracy, not which specific weights are pruned. 

2) Based on this, they formulate PAI as a convex optimization problem that directly solves for the optimal layer-wise density subject to model size/FLOPs constraints. This avoids the need to compute importance scores for individual weights.

3) They propose a structured PAI method called PreCropping that prunes channels to achieve a desired layer-wise density. This enables practical speedups compared to unstructured PAI methods.

4) They propose PreConfig, which relaxes the density constraints in PreCropping to expand/shrink layer widths. This allows fast architecture search over layer widths.

5) Experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet show PreCropping matches or improves accuracy over the state-of-the-art unstructured PAI method SynFlow, while also being structured. PreConfig improves accuracy over standard models by optimizing layer widths.

In summary, the key innovation is formulating PAI as direct optimization of layer-wise density, enabling both efficient unstructured and structured PAI. The paper demonstrates strong empirical performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new structured pruning method called "PreCropping" (PreCrop) for pruning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at initialization. The goal is to reduce model size and computational costs without accuracy loss. 

- The paper first analytically shows that for pruning-at-initialization (PAI) methods, only the layer-wise density (fraction of remaining weights per layer) matters, not which specific weights are pruned. Based on this, the paper formulates PAI as a convex optimization problem that directly optimizes for layer-wise density.

- The paper then proposes PreCrop, which prunes entire channels of a CNN to achieve a desired layer-wise density. This makes the pruned model more hardware friendly compared to unstructured pruning methods like Synaptic Flow.

- PreCrop is shown empirically to achieve higher accuracy compared to Synaptic Flow on ImageNet classification for ResNet, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet architectures. For example, PreCrop improves top-1 accuracy by 2.7% on a pruned MobileNetV2 model relative to Synaptic Flow.

- The paper also proposes a variant called PreConfig that can expand layers to reconfigure model width, achieving further accuracy improvements with similar FLOPs as the baseline model. For example, PreConfig improves EfficientNet-B0 accuracy by 0.3% on ImageNet while reducing parameters by 20%.

In summary, the key contribution is a new structured pruning method PreCrop that is designed for CNNs at initialization and achieves better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than prior unstructured methods like Synaptic Flow. The convex formulation and width reconfiguration are additional technical contributions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Structured Pruning-at-Initialization (PreCrop), a method to prune convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a structured way before training starts. The method is based on a theoretical analysis showing that for pruning-at-initialization (PAI) methods, only the layer-wise density (fraction of remaining weights per layer) matters, not which specific weights are pruned. 

The authors formulate PAI as a convex optimization problem that directly optimizes for the optimal layer-wise density under constraints on model size and/or FLOPs. This avoids the need to evaluate importance scores for individual weights like prior PAI methods. 

Based on this formulation, the authors propose PreCrop, which prunes channels of CNNs before training to achieve the optimal densities. For layers with residual connections, a scheme is introduced to handle constraints on matching number of channels. 

Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that PreCrop matches or improves accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art unstructured PAI method SynFlow, while also being structured and hardware-friendly. For example, on ImageNet, PreCrop improves top-1 accuracy by 2.7% and 0.9% over SynFlow for MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 respectively.

The authors also introduce PreConfig, a variant of PreCrop that expands channels for layers where optimal density > 1. This ultra-fast neural architecture search method optimizes channel numbers before training starts and achieves higher accuracy than original models, e.g. +0.3% for EfficientNetB0 on ImageNet with 20% fewer parameters.

In summary, the paper provides a theoretical analysis of PAI methods, and uses it to develop an effective structured PAI approach that matches or improves on unstructured methods while enabling practical speedups. The ultra-fast width optimization method also achieves promising results.
