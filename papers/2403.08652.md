# [Extracting Explanations, Justification, and Uncertainty from Black-Box   Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) act as black boxes, making it hard to understand their predictions or trust them for mission-critical applications. 
- Prior methods for explainable AI like gradient-based attribution or metric learning have limitations in computational efficiency, retraining needs, or explanation quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Use sparse Gaussian processes (SGPs) to extract example-based justifications and uncertainty estimates from pretrained DNNs. 
- SGPs reduce computation compared to regular GPs, allowing application to large datasets.
- Replace previous support neighborhoods with SGP kernel functions to find training samples most relevant to a test sample.
- Use number of nearby inducing points to define support sufficiency for a prediction.
- Estimate epistemic uncertainty from density and coherence of inducing points.

Contributions:
- Efficient approach to get example-based explanations and uncertainty for any black-box DNN without retraining.
- Leverage SGPs for lower memory and compute footprint compared to prior work.  
- Define metric using SGP kernel functions to find most correlated samples between training and test sets.
- Demonstrate accuracy and uncertainty estimation comparable to prior work but with much lower compute time.

In experiments, the SGP method matches baseline accuracy while reducing inference time by 100x on CIFAR-10 images, using only a subset of training data. This enables model justification and uncertainty-aware operation even on edge devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach using sparse Gaussian processes to efficiently extract explanations, justifications, and uncertainty estimates from pre-trained deep neural networks without retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel approach to extract explanations, justifications, and uncertainty estimates from pre-trained deep neural networks using sparse Gaussian processes. Specifically:

- They present an approach that uses sparse Gaussian processes to take the latent embeddings from a pre-trained DNN and predict the model output. This allows estimating prediction uncertainty while leveraging the representation power of the DNN.

- They obtain example-based justifications for the model's predictions by selecting the training set samples that are highly correlated with the test samples, using the sparse GP's kernel functions to determine the correlations. 

- Their approach is computationally efficient both in terms of memory and computation compared to prior work, and can be applied to any black-box DNN without retraining.

- They demonstrate their approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing it can improve interpretability and reliability of DNNs by providing uncertainty estimates and justifications based on influential training examples.

In summary, the main contribution is a new computationally-efficient method to extract explanations and uncertainty from pre-trained DNNs using sparse Gaussian processes.
