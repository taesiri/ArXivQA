# [Secure Domain Adaptation with Multiple Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12124v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the problem of multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA) while preserving privacy across the source domains and between the sources and target. 

The central hypothesis is that the target domain error can be minimized by aligning the target distribution to intermediate distributions that approximate the source domains in a shared latent space, without needing direct access to the source data. This allows knowledge transfer from multiple sources while maintaining privacy.

The key research questions are:

- How can the source domain distributions be approximated without accessing the private source data directly? 

- How can the target distribution be aligned to these intermediate approximations?

- How can the adapted source models be combined to make predictions on the target domain?

The authors propose using Gaussian mixture models to estimate the source distributions in the latent space, aligning these to the target distribution via sliced Wasserstein distance minimization, and pooling adapted model predictions weighted by their reliability on the target domain.

In summary, this work focuses on enabling privacy-preserving MUDA by approximating and aligning distributions across multiple sources and a target domain without directly sharing private data. The core hypothesis is that this indirect alignment can enable effective knowledge transfer and minimize the target error.
