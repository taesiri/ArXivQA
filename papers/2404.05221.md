# [LLM Reasoners: New Evaluation, Library, and Analysis of Step-by-Step   Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating reasoning chains generated by LLMs is challenging. Correct final answers do not necessarily imply sound reasoning processes. Manual evaluation requires extensive human effort.  
- Existing reasoning algorithms have varied formulations and implementations, making systematic analysis difficult. 

Proposed Solutions:

1) \evalname: Fully automated reasoning chain evaluation
- Summarizes common reasoning errors into an evaluation criteria list for each task  
- Instructs GPT-4 to check each step against the criteria
- Achieves strong correlation with human judgement and detects 70.4% false positive reasoning chains

2) \reasoners: Unified perspective and library of reasoning algorithms 
- Formulates as reward-guided search to maximize accumulated rewards
- Key components: reward function, world model, search algorithm
- Provides standardized implementation to reproduce and compose new algorithms

Analysis Findings:  
- Reward-guided search reduces false positives more effectively
- Search breadth more important than depth for expansive spaces  
- Incorporating world models significantly enhances embodied reasoning
- Prompt formats impact tendency for false positives

In summary, the paper proposes an automated evaluation method and unified framework to better understand and improve multi-step reasoning with LLMs. The analysis offers new insights into algorithm designs and LLM capabilities.
