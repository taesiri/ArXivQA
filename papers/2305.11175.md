# VisionLLM: Large Language Model is also an Open-Ended Decoder for   Vision-Centric Tasks

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it aims to address is:How can we develop a unified generalist framework that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to handle vision-centric tasks in an open-ended and customizable manner through language instructions?The key ideas and goals of the paper can be summarized as:- LLMs have shown impressive performance on various NLP tasks through user-tailored prompts/instructions. However, their applicability to vision tasks has been limited due to differences in modality and task format. - The paper proposes VisionLLM, a novel framework to align vision tasks with LLM methodologies using language instructions. This allows flexibly defining and customizing vision tasks like LLMs.- VisionLLM consists of three components: (1) unified language instructions for vision tasks, (2) language-guided image tokenizer, (3) LLM-based open-ended task decoder.- It supports customizable vision tasks at different granularities, from object-level to task-level, through language prompts.- Experiments show it achieves strong performance on diverse vision tasks like detection, segmentation, captioning. Remarkably, it gets 60% mAP on COCO using a generalist LLM-based model.In summary, the key research question is how to develop a generalist vision framework that can harness LLMs' reasoning and language capabilities to handle customizable vision tasks through language instructions in an open-ended manner. The VisionLLM model is proposed as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposes VisionLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address vision-centric tasks in an open-ended and customizable manner through language instructions. 2. Designs a unified language instruction to accommodate both vision and vision-language tasks, allowing flexible task customization.3. Develops a language-guided image tokenizer to encode visual information in alignment with language prompts, and an LLM-based open-ended task decoder to generate outputs.4. Achieves strong performance on diverse vision-centric tasks like object detection, instance segmentation, visual grounding, image captioning, and VQA, showcasing the versatility of the proposed framework.5. Demonstrates the capability to customize tasks at different levels of granularity, from fine-grained object-level to coarse-grained task-level, through language instructions.6. With a generalist LLM-based framework, achieves over 60% mAP on COCO object detection, comparable to specialized detection models, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach.In summary, the key contribution is proposing VisionLLM, a novel generalist framework that unifies vision and language modalities through language instructions, unlocking the reasoning and open-ended capabilities of LLMs for vision-centric tasks. This sets a new direction for building unified vision-language models.
