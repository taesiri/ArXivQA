# [Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04382)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel iterative anomaly detection framework called IADC that improves the performance of base anomaly detectors under data contamination. IADC iteratively trains an ensemble of base anomaly detectors by reweighting the training data through importance sampling. In each iteration, the importance weights are updated to reduce the influence of potential anomalies so that the ensemble focuses more on normal data patterns. A stopping criterion based on the outlier ratio automatically determines convergence during this iterative process. Experiments across various real-world datasets and base detectors show that IADC boosts performance over single models and traditional anomaly detection ensembles. Additional analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of IADC's reweighting scheme in identifying anomalies and producing consistent anomaly scores. Key strengths of this framework are its general applicability to many anomaly detectors without changing model architectures, robustness improvements to contaminated data, interpretable learning process, and strong empirical results. Through its unique iterative approach, IADC advances the field towards more reliable unsupervised anomaly detection.
