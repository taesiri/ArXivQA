# [Reinforcement Learning for Online Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems:   a Replication and Extension Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Testing autonomous driving systems (ADS) is challenging but critical to ensure their safety. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been proposed as a promising technique for online testing of ADS.
- A previous study (Haq et al. 2023) proposed MORLOT, an RL-based testing technique, and showed it outperforms alternatives like random testing. However, replication studies are lacking to validate such claims in empirical software engineering.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper presents a replication and extension of the study by Haq et al. on using RL for online testing of ADS.

Replication: 
- The replication does not confirm the superior performance of MORLOT over random testing. Under the same conditions, MORLOT and random testing have statistically equal effectiveness and efficiency.
- Two key limitations of formulating the RL problem are identified - the reward function provides misleading feedback, and using Q-learning with a continuous state space reduces learning capability.

Extension:
- The extension addresses the limitations by using DQN to handle the continuous state space and focusing on a single safety requirement's reward.
- In most testing routes, the DQN agent significantly outperforms both Q-learning and random testing in triggering safety violations of the ADS under test.
- The extension shows RL can accelerate testing but highlights remaining challenges in formulating states, actions and rewards.

Key Contributions:
- Rigorous replication of a key study on RL-based testing for ADS, enabling reliable future research.
- Identification of limitations in using RL for ADS testing.
- Demonstration that a deep RL agent can significantly improve upon random testing, opening research into more thorough RL formulations.
- Qualitative analysis of learned policies to provide insights for developing more complex test scenarios.
