# [Pedipulate: Enabling Manipulation Skills using a Quadruped Robot's Leg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10837)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Legged robots have potential for tasks like maintenance, home support, and exploration. However, most current legged robots require an additional robotic arm for manipulation capabilities, increasing mechanical complexity and cost. This paper explores using a quadruped robot's own legs for manipulation (pedipulation) to reduce complexity while still enabling real-world skills.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop a reinforcement learning-based controller that can robustly track foot position targets on a quadruped robot (ANYmal). The controller reaches targets in a large workspace through whole-body motions without changing stance, and can also walk on 3 legs towards far-away targets (loco-pedipulation). It is robust to disturbances like slippery floors, interaction forces, etc.

The controller is trained in simulation using PPO and deployed on ANYmal. Various real-world manipulation skills are demonstrated by teleoperating the robot with the controller, including:
- Opening doors and fridges
- Transporting backpack
- Pressing hard-to-reach button  
- Pushing obstacle out of the way
- Collecting rock sample with gripper on foot

Main Contributions:
- Foot position tracking controller using RL that enables various real-world manipulation skills
- Large reachable workspace through whole-body motions without stance change 
- Seamless locomotion for far-away targets (loco-pedipulation)
- Robustness to disturbances like slippery floors, interaction forces
- Demonstration of multiple real-world skills through teleoperation

The work shows many manipulation tasks can be achieved through pedipulation on quadruped robots, reducing complexity compared to using arms, enabling applications like exploration or home robots.
