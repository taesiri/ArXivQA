# GODEL: Large-Scale Pre-Training for Goal-Directed Dialog

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop a large pre-trained dialog model that is effective for adapting to a wide range of downstream dialog tasks requiring external knowledge/information?The key points are:- Existing pre-trained dialog models like DialoGPT are limited in their ability to leverage external knowledge and be adapted to knowledge-grounded dialog tasks. - The authors propose a new model called GODEL (Grounded Open Dialogue Language Model) that is pre-trained in multiple phases, including a grounded dialog pre-training phase using datasets that require responses conditioned on external knowledge.- They evaluate GODEL on a variety of goal-directed dialog tasks like task-oriented dialog, conversational QA, and open-domain grounded dialog. - The paper shows GODEL outperforms existing pre-trained dialog models like DialoGPT in few-shot fine-tuning setups on these downstream tasks in terms of both human and automatic evaluation.- The paper also introduces a notion of utility for evaluating dialog models, assessing the usefulness of responses beyond just communicative quality. This utility-driven evaluation is shown to have better inter-annotator agreement and correlation with automated metrics compared to intrinsic evaluation alone.So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a pre-trained dialog model that can effectively leverage external knowledge/information for improved performance on downstream goal-directed dialog tasks through a multi-phase pre-training approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Introduction of GODEL (Grounded Open Dialogue Language Model), a large pre-trained language model for dialog that is designed for general-domain conversation and fully open-sourced. 2. GODEL is pre-trained in three phases, incorporating data from web text, publicly-available dialog, and existing corpora that support grounded dialog tasks. The grounded pre-training is designed to enable adapting GODEL to downstream dialog tasks that require external knowledge.3. Evaluation of GODEL on a suite of benchmarks spanning task-oriented dialog, conversational QA, and open-domain dialog. The results show GODEL outperforms prior pre-trained dialog models like DialoGPT in few-shot fine-tuning setups. 4. Introduction of a notion of utility for dialog systems that focuses on the usefulness of responses, rather than just intrinsic qualities like fluency. This utility is shown to offer better inter-annotator agreement and correlation with automated metrics.5. Release of GODEL models, data, and code to serve as strong baselines for future research in goal-directed dialog. The models released range from 220M to 770M parameters, as well as a 175B parameter version based on GPT-J.In summary, the main contributions are the GODEL model itself, the utility-focused evaluation methodology, and the public release of models/data to facilitate research in this area. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GODEL for goal-directed dialog tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on skimming the paper, here is a one sentence summary:This paper introduces GODEL, a large pre-trained dialog model with three phases of pre-training (on web text, dialog data, and grounded dialog data) that achieves strong performance when fine-tuned on goal-oriented dialog tasks, outperforming prior models like DialoGPT.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in pre-trained dialog models:- This paper introduces GODEL, a large pre-trained dialog model with three phases of pre-training: on text corpora, dialog data, and grounded dialog datasets. Other models like DialoGPT and BlenderBot are pre-trained primarily on text and dialog data without an explicit grounding phase. Grounding helps GODEL fine-tune better for goal-oriented dialog tasks.- The paper evaluates GODEL more extensively on goal-oriented dialog tasks compared to prior work. Many models focus evaluation on open-domain chitchat. GODEL is tested on grounded response generation, conversational QA, and task-oriented dialog. This tests the model's utility and goal-directedness. - The paper proposes a unified notion of "utility" for dialog evaluation, measured via human evaluation on usefulness. Most prior work uses more task-specific metrics. The utility metric provides a general way to compare models across different dialog tasks and datasets.- The paper analyzes the correlation of different automatic metrics with human judgments of utility. Metrics based on lexical overlap like BLEU and chrF correlate better with utility than embedding-based metrics like BERTScore and BLEURT. This analysis helps determine what automatic metrics may be suitable for goal-directed dialog.- The paper shows GODEL outperforms models like DialoGPT and BlenderBot on goal-oriented datasets in few-shot learning. This demonstrates the benefit of grounding for adapting quickly to new dialog tasks.In summary, this paper advances dialog pre-training by incorporating explicit grounding, focuses more on goal-oriented evaluation, and provides analysis to understand automatic metrics and model performance on goal-directed dialog tasks. The proposed utility metric and few-shot learning setup are useful for benchmarking future research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few future research directions:1. Further exploration of extrinsic vs intrinsic evaluation of dialog systems: The paper advocates for greater use of extrinsic evaluation that focuses on the utility/goal-directedness of dialog systems. They suggest more research is needed in this area to develop better extrinsic evaluation metrics and understand how to optimize systems for extrinsic qualities like usefulness. 2. Mitigating social bias and toxicity: The authors acknowledge that harmful biases may persist in dialog models despite attempts to filter the training data. They suggest further work on model safety and mitigating social bias is an important area for the field.3. Optimizing for utility/goal-directedness to improve safety: The paper notes that goal-directed dialogs tend to also be safer. The authors suggest optimizing conversational AI explicitly for utility/goal-directedness could have the additional benefit of improving model safety. 4. Few-shot learning for goal-directed dialog: The authors evaluate models in few-shot settings and suggest few-shot learning is an important capability since goal-directed datasets tend to be small. More research into effective few-shot learning for dialog is suggested.5. Grounded dialog research: The paper focuses on grounded dialog with external knowledge sources. Further research into grounded dialog models that can effectively leverage knowledge is proposed.In summary, the main future directions highlighted are: 1) advancing extrinsic evaluation, 2) improving model safety, 3) few-shot learning for dialog, and 4) knowledge-grounded dialog research. The authors propose goal-directedness and utility as a key focus to drive progress in conversational AI.
