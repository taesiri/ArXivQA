# [Do Large Language Models Understand Logic or Just Mimick Context?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12091)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on logical reasoning tasks when provided with in-context examples, but it is unclear if they truly understand logical rules or just rely on statistical patterns. 

- The paper investigates whether LLMs genuinely comprehend logical reasoning or just mimic expected outputs based on contextual clues.

Methodology: 
- The authors systematically divide in-context examples into text, reasoning chains, and patterns. They also provide definitions of logical symbols.

- They test model robustness by replacing or modifying these components and examining if performance declines. Replacement uses in-domain or out-of-domain text.  

- Modification swaps definitions of AND/OR symbols then checks if models interchange usage in outputs, indicating comprehension.

Key Findings:
- In-context learning substantially improves LLM logical reasoning performance. More examples and larger models show bigger gains.

- Larger models are quite robust to distorted in-context data but smaller models decline sharply. Out-of-domain text can even boost smaller models.

- Altering logical definitions produces negligible true modification rates in outputs, suggesting lack of deeper logical understanding across models.

- Additional prompting and examples improve modification rates but high accuracy still requires in-context demonstration.

Main Contributions:  
- First study to systematically evaluate logical comprehension in LLMs using counterfactual analysis.

- Reveals that in-context learning enables statistical pattern matching rather than genuine logical understanding in state-of-the-art LLMs. 

- Underscores need for alternative training strategies focused on processing longer dependencies for enhanced reasoning.
