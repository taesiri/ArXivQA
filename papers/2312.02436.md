# [MUFFIN: Curating Multi-Faceted Instructions for Improving   Instruction-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02436)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Muffin, a new scheme for curating instruction-following datasets by scaling the number of tasks per input text. Unlike prior paradigms that scale input-output pairs per task (Scaling-Inputs) or scale the number of input-free tasks (Scaling Input-Free Tasks), Muffin's Scaling Tasks per Input paradigm diversifies tasks for each input text to enhance instruction following. To address challenges in task diversity and classification-generation balance, the authors propose an input-facet-oriented instruction generation approach along with a classification expansion method. Experiments using GPT-3.5 tune show Muffin consistently outperforms prior schemes across instruction datasets and benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal Muffin's superiority stems from effectively controlling model sensitivity to inputs and increased diversity. By scaling tasks tailored to each input, Muffin enhances instruction adherence and generalizability. The comprehensive results prove the promise of this new Scaling Tasks per Input scheme for building superior instruction-following abilities.
