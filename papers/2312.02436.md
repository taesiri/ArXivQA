# [MUFFIN: Curating Multi-Faceted Instructions for Improving   Instruction-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02436)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Muffin, a new scheme for curating instruction-following datasets by scaling the number of tasks per input text. Unlike prior paradigms that scale input-output pairs per task (Scaling-Inputs) or scale the number of input-free tasks (Scaling Input-Free Tasks), Muffin's Scaling Tasks per Input paradigm diversifies tasks for each input text to enhance instruction following. To address challenges in task diversity and classification-generation balance, the authors propose an input-facet-oriented instruction generation approach along with a classification expansion method. Experiments using GPT-3.5 tune show Muffin consistently outperforms prior schemes across instruction datasets and benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal Muffin's superiority stems from effectively controlling model sensitivity to inputs and increased diversity. By scaling tasks tailored to each input, Muffin enhances instruction adherence and generalizability. The comprehensive results prove the promise of this new Scaling Tasks per Input scheme for building superior instruction-following abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new dataset curation paradigm called "Scaling Tasks per Input" for improving instruction-following in large language models, and introduces a corresponding dataset called Muffin that outperforms existing schemes on several benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It proposes a new paradigm called "Scaling Tasks per Input" for crafting instruction-following datasets. This paradigm focuses on diversifying the tasks for each input text rather than simply amplifying input-output pairs (\ScaleInput) or enlarging input-free tasks (\ScaleInputFree).

2. It develops a novel instruction synthesis framework that takes into account inputs' various facets to increase task diversity and instruction-input relevance. The paper also introduces \OurDataName, the first instruction-following dataset aligning with the proposed \ScaleTaskPerInput paradigm.

3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that language models trained on \OurDataName exhibit superior instruction-following capabilities compared to models trained on datasets constructed using previous paradigms. This is shown through strong performance on four challenging zero-shot evaluation benchmarks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Instruction following - The capability of large language models to follow given instructions to accomplish tasks or generate outputs. A core focus of the paper.

- Dataset curation paradigms - The paper discusses different paradigms for creating instruction-following datasets, including scaling input-output pairs, scaling input-free tasks, and the proposed scaling of tasks per input.  

- Task diversity - Generating varied tasks and instructions for the same input text to improve instruction following. One of the main goals of the proposed approach.

- Facet-based instruction generation - Leveraging different textual facets or attributes of inputs to stimulate the creation of diverse and relevant instructions. A key technique proposed.  

- Supervised neural instructions (SuperNI) - An existing human-annotated instruction following dataset used for evaluation.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing approaches for enhancing instruction-following in large language models (LLMs) primarily adopt two schemes: (i) Scaling input-output pairs per task (\ScaleInput); (ii) Expanding input-free tasks (\ScaleInputFree). 
- \ScaleInput tends to make models over-sensitive to inputs, causing misinterpretation of instructions. \ScaleInputFree requires substantial tasks but struggles on \ScaleInput tasks.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduces \ScaleTaskPerInput - a new scheme that diversifies tasks per input to improve instruction-following. 
- Develops \OurDataName, the first dataset aligning with \ScaleTaskPerInput. It has two key technical contributions:

1. Instruction Brainstorming: Generates varied instructions based on different textual facets of each input using LLMs like ChatGPT. Improves relevance between inputs and instructions.  

2. Instruction Rematching: Reuses existing high-quality human instructions and matches them to inputs using LLMs, filtering out irrelevant ones.

- Additionally handles class imbalance by expanding classification tasks.

Main Results:
- Experiments on 4 zero-shot benchmarks with 3B and 11B parameter LMs.
- LLMs trained on \OurDataName consistently outperform \ScaleInput and \ScaleInputFree schemes.
- Human evaluation shows substantially higher acceptance ratios over baselines.
- Analyses reveal contributions of each module and low similarity between \OurDataName and test tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Novel \ScaleTaskPerInput paradigm for instruction dataset creation.
- \OurDataName dataset and automated creation framework.
- Demonstrates enhanced instruction-following for LLMs, outperforming prior schemes.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the proposed solution methodology, main results achieved, and primary contributions made in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
