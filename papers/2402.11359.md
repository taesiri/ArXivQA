# [Training Language Model Agents without Modifying Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reframing large language models (LLMs) as agents has enabled them to automate complex tasks using specialized functions. However, creating good functions is challenging - it requires manual effort and iterations. Finetuning the LLM weights to improve function usage is also difficult since many LLMs are inaccessible/proprietary. 

Solution - Agent Training Paradigm:
The paper proposes a new paradigm to train LLM agents without modifying LLM weights. The key ideas are:

(1) Treat functions as "agent parameters" instead of model parameters. 

(2) Draw an analogy between model training and agent training: model parameters ↔ agent functions; loss function ↔ agent’s historical performance.

(3) Use LLM-based "AgentOptimizer" to update agent functions based on execution history, replacing numeric optimizers like SGD.

(4) Update functions progressively via add/modify/remove actions instead of regenerating the whole set.

(5) Use roll-back and early-stop to avoid performance drops during training.

Contributions:

(1) Proposed the agent training paradigm to create specialized LLM agents without finetuning weights.

(2) Developed key components like AgentOptimizer and the training algorithm. 

(3) Showcased significant performance boosts by training GPT-4+ and ReAct agents on mathematical reasoning, tabular processing, general real-world tasks. 

(4) Analyzed agent behavior - learning curves, domain transferability, function complexity.

The paradigm provides an alternative way to build LLM agents that does not require weight tuning access. It iteratively optimizes functions to adapt agents to downstream tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel paradigm for training language model agents without modifying the language model weights by treating the agent's functions as learnable parameters and using a tailored AgentOptimizer based on the language model's capabilities to iteratively update the functions over training epochs according to the agent's execution history.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm for training language model agents without modifying the underlying language model weights. Specifically:

1) It introduces a novel analogy between the learnable parameters in traditional machine learning models and the operational functions of language model agents. It also draws an analogy between models' loss functions and agents' execution history over training data. Based on these analogies, it develops a tailored training regime to enhance agents' capabilities.

2) To realize this paradigm, the paper proposes the AgentOptimizer, which leverages language models' exceptional capabilities to iteratively update agents' functions based on their performance over training data. It uses natural language to guide the optimization process.

3) The paper presents an agent training algorithm using the AgentOptimizer along with two strategies - roll-back and early-stop - to streamline the training process. 

4) It conducts extensive experiments on multiple datasets and tasks to demonstrate that this paradigm of agent training without modifying language model weights can significantly improve the performance of representative language model agents like GPT-4+ agent and ReAct agent.

In summary, the key innovation is a new paradigm and methodology for training language model agents to make them more capable at downstream tasks without needing to fine-tune the underlying large language models.

The paper introduces a new paradigm called "agent training" to train language model agents without modifying the underlying language models. The key idea is to treat functions as "learnable parameters" for the agents and leverage language models to iteratively update these functions, similar to how models are trained in traditional AI. Concepts like the AgentOptimizer, roll-back, early-stop, and progressive function update are proposed to realize this agent training framework. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, tabular processing, and general real-world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. So the core focus is on developing specialized language model agents through optimizing their functions, rather than modifying the base language models.
