# [Small But Funny: A Feedback-Driven Approach to Humor Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18113)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs) to small language models (SLMs) works well for simpler tasks, but there is a substantial performance gap for more complex and creative tasks like humor generation. The gap likely stems from the fact that creative tasks are harder to learn purely through imitation and may require additional guidance.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel distillation framework with two phases - imitation followed by critical feedback. In the imitation phase, the SLM is trained on humorous text pairs generated by the LLM teacher. In the feedback phase, the LLM takes on an additional role as a "critic" to evaluate and provide preferences on SLM-generated candidate text pairs. This feedback is then used to further train the SLM.

Key Contributions:
- Novel dual role for the LLM as both a teacher for generating data and a critic for providing feedback to guide the SLM.
- New feedback-based objectives like Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) and BRIO ranking loss to incorporate the critic's preferences.
- Experiments on humor generation revealing that feedback narrows the performance gap between SLMs and LLMs significantly compared to just imitation.
- Analysis of the effect of design choices like feedback frequency and data size on student performance.
- Investigation into potential biases in LLM critics and their effect on student training.

Overall, the work highlights the promise of using feedback as an extra teaching signal alongside imitation for distilling creative abilities like humor generation into smaller, more efficient models. The analysis also motivates future work to mitigate issues in LLM evaluation.
