# [Churn Reduction via Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02654v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to reduce model churn when updating a machine learning model on new data, while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, the paper proposes using knowledge distillation to reduce churn and provides theoretical and empirical justification.

The key hypothesis is that training a model on a distillation loss that mixes the original labels with the softened predictions from the base model will lead to lower churn while maintaining accuracy compared to other methods like warm starting or anchor loss.

In summary, the main research question is: Can knowledge distillation be an effective technique for reducing churn in machine learning models during updating, and if so, why? The hypothesis is that distillation can reduce churn more effectively than other techniques. The theoretical and empirical analyses aim to justify this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing knowledge distillation as a method to reduce classifier churn, and providing theoretical and empirical analysis to support using distillation for this purpose.

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Framing the problem of classifier churn, which measures the change in predictions between an updated model and an original base model. This is an important problem in machine learning model deployment.

- Proposing knowledge distillation as a solution, where the updated model is trained to mimic the softened predictions of the base model. 

- Providing theoretical analysis that shows distillation can find the optimal trade-off between accuracy and churn when using proper scoring rules.

- Empirically evaluating distillation against several baselines on a range of datasets and model architectures. The results demonstrate that distillation consistently provides low churn without sacrificing accuracy.

- Analyzing the connections between distillation and the anchor loss method for churn reduction, and showing distillation performs better.

Overall, the paper makes a compelling case for using distillation as a practical and principled approach to reduce classifier churn during model updates. The theoretical grounding combined with strong empirical results on real datasets are the key contributions.
