# [MagicStick: Controllable Video Editing via Control Handle   Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03047)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Video editing tasks like changing object shapes, sizes, locations, and motions remain challenging. Applying image edits to video frames causes issues like flickering and lack of temporal consistency. Previous video editing methods focused more on style transfer or replacing objects, not properties like geometry and motion. 

Method - MagicStick:
The key idea is to edit the properties of a video by transforming control signals (like object sketches or human poses) in keyframes and propagating the transforms. This allows geometry edits while retaining appearance. 

The method has four main components:

1. Video Customization Network: Tuned from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate the appearance of the input video based on a text prompt and control signals. Uses added temporal attention and tuning strategies.

2. Control Handle Transform: The user selects an object and edits its control signal (sketch, pose, etc.) in one keyframe. The edit is propagated to other frames.

3. Controllable Inversion + Generation: The edited control signals guide the inversion to get latent codes and the generation to create the edited video.  

4. Attention ReMix Module: Blends the self-attention from inversion and explicit guidance from the control signals during generation. This localizes edits.

Main Contributions:

- First method to demonstrate controllable editing of geometric properties like shape, size, location, and motion in videos using a pre-trained text-to-image model

- Effective Attention ReMix module to isolate edits to specific regions and retain unrelated content  

- Experiments show ability to perform a variety of edits by transforming control signals, and advantages over recent video editing methods in quality and consistency

The method expands the capabilities of video editing using pre-trained generative models. Limitations are trouble with large motion trajectory changes. Future work may test on video diffusion models.
