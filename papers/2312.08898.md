# [Detection and Defense of Unlearnable Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08898)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper demonstrates the detectability and defensibility of unlearnable examples, which are a type of data poisoning attack proposed for privacy preservation. The authors first prove that certain unlearnable attacks result in linear separability of the poisoned dataset. Based on this theoretical finding and the observation that unlearnable noises are robust to large bias shifts, they propose two effective detection algorithms - Simple Networks Detection and Bias-Shifting Noise Test. Experiments across CIFAR and TinyImageNet datasets show that these algorithms can identify all major unlearnable attacks with high accuracy. Furthermore, the authors develop a defense strategy focused on destroying detectability of unlearnable examples, using stronger data augmentations coupled with adversarial noises generated by simple networks. This approach not only degrades detectability but also achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against common unlearnable attacks based on the key insight that breaking detectability is essential. Finally, the paper establishes theoretical criteria on the relationship between poison and adversarial defense budgets that determine the success of robust unlearnable attacks and failure of adversarial training defenses. Overall, this work significantly advances understanding of the limitations of unlearnable examples.
