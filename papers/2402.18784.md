# [Brain-inspired and Self-based Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18784)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current AI lacks a sense of "self" and true subjective self-awareness like humans. Without constructing a sense of self in AI, it is fundamentally impossible to develop machines that truly "think". 

- Existing cognitive architectures and AI methods do not adequately capture higher-order cognition such as self-awareness that is crucial for human-level intelligence.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new Brain-inspired and Self-based AI (BriSe AI) paradigm that aims to endow AI with a genuine understanding of self, environment and others under self-supervision. 

- BriSe AI is based on a hierarchical framework of Self, consisting of 5 levels: Perception & Learning, Bodily Self, Autonomous Self, Social Self and Conceptual Self.

- The positive mutual promotion between learning strategies and Self is the key driving force for BriSe AI to achieve advanced general intelligence. 

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive self framework introduced into an AI cognitive architecture with demonstration of various self-related cognitive capabilities.

- Realization of multiple self-based functions ranging from bodily self-perception, decision making, ToM to empathy on robots.

- A spiking neural network based implementation that integrates components like neurons, learning rules, encoding schemes from BrainCog infrastructure.

- Mutual enhancement between learning strategies (e.g. unsupervised, reinforcement, transfer learning) and Self, enabling leap from information processing to deeper understanding.

In summary, this paper proposes a paradigm shift rooted in self-supervision to endow machines with genuine intelligence, and demonstrates initial progress towards this goal. The BriSe AI paradigm highlights the crucial role of self in shaping advanced AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces BriSe AI, a new paradigm for AI based on a hierarchical framework of Self including multiple levels ranging from perception and learning to conceptual self, which aims to achieve human-level intelligence through the mutual promotion between learning strategies and Self.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces a new paradigm for AI called Brain-inspired and Self-based Artificial Intelligence (BriSe AI). The main contributions are:

1. Proposes a hierarchical framework of Self for AI, including 5 levels: Perception & Learning, Bodily Self, Autonomous Self, Social Self, and Conceptual Self. This provides a practical framework for self-modeling in AI.

2. Realizes various self-based cognitive functions, from bodily self-perception to social abilities like theory of mind and affective empathy. This shows the potential of self-based AI for more human-like intelligence. 

3. Describes the mutual promotion between learning and Self, where self-based learning strategies help realize different levels of Self, and Self modulates learning for deeper understanding. This interaction is key for BriSe AI's adaptability and advanced intelligence.

4. Implements the BriSe AI paradigm using spiking neural networks and the BrainCog infrastructure to integrate cognitive functions and learning strategies in a biologically realistic manner.

5. Provides a new paradigm and roadmap for future AI research focused on self-based modeling and consciousness, with the goal of achieving artificial general intelligence and harmonious human-AI coexistence.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and realizing a new self-based AI paradigm called BriSe AI to work towards more human-like artificial general intelligence. The hierarchical Self framework and its implementation are key to this paradigm.
