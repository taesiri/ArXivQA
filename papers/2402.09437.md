# [Managing Household Waste through Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09437)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- The world is facing an escalating global waste crisis that is projected to increase 70% by 2050. Efficient waste identification and management is crucial to mitigate climate change impacts and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
- Absence of a standardized waste classification system has resulted in regional disparities.
- Existing works have limited number of waste categories and do not examine model carbon emissions.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage transfer learning models like EfficientNetV2, ResNet, and MobileNet pre-trained on ImageNet to classify waste into 10 categories: metal, glass, paper, battery, trash, cardboard, shoes, clothes and plastic.
- Compare model performance on metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, IoU and carbon emissions. 
- Apply data augmentation and model enhancement techniques like early stopping and hyperparameter optimization to improve model accuracy.
- Benchmark carbon emissions of model development, training and deployment using CodeCarbon.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of transfer learning models for multi-class (10 categories) waste classification using Garbage dataset.
- First study to examine ecological impact through carbon emissions of models.  
- Showed EfficientNetV2S achieves best accuracy of 96.41% with moderate emissions.
- ResNet50 outperforms ResNet101 in accuracy and emissions. 
- MobileNet has lowest accuracy and emissions.
- Demonstrated model enhancement techniques can further improve accuracy.
- Research highlights need to consider sustainability of ML models alongside accuracy.

In summary, the paper leverages transfer learning for multi-class waste classification while analyzing model carbon emissions to identify the most accurate and sustainable approach. Key findings show EfficientNetV2S reaches 96.41% accuracy with moderate carbon footprint demonstrating that model accuracy and ecological impact should be jointly optimized.
