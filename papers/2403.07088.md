# [SPA: Towards A Computational Friendly Cloud-Base and On-Devices   Collaboration Seq2seq Personalized Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to high memory and computational requirements. 
- Privacy risks arise when sensitive user data is processed on the cloud during training or inference.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Side Plugin Adaptation (SPA), a lightweight architecture for fast on-device inference while retaining privacy. 
- SPA establishes collaboration between a pretrained LLM on the cloud and additive parameters on the device to leverage knowledge from both the LLM and private personal features.
- A classifier is introduced to choose between using the LLM or the on-device model, minimizing adapter usage while maximizing inherent LLM capabilities. This reduces transmission latency.

Main Contributions:
- The proposed SPA framework significantly reduces the difficulty of fully deploying LLMs on-device via separable adapters.
- The introduced classifier improves efficiency of cloud-device transmission while maintaining performance.
- Comprehensive evaluations show SPA performs well on-device with lower transmission latency compared to traditional approaches.
- SPA provides a solution for deploying adapters on-device while keeping general parameters on the cloud server to reduce privacy risks.

In summary, the paper introduces SPA, an innovative cloud-device collaborative architecture using adapters and a classifier for fast on-device LLM inference while ensuring privacy. Evaluations demonstrate SPA's advantages over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes SPA, a lightweight architecture for fast on-device inference and privacy retention in seq2seq personalized generation through a collaboration between a cloud-based pretrained LLM and additive parameters on the device.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. The paper proposes the SPA (Side Plugin Adaptation) framework, which achieves deployment of large language models on devices by separating adapters from pre-trained models. This significantly reduces the difficulty of fully deploying large models on the edge and provides a feasible and efficient solution.

2. The paper introduces a classifier to determine whether to use adapter content for inference. This innovative classifier design greatly improves the efficiency of cloud-to-edge transmission while maintaining task performance. 

3. The SPA framework has been thoroughly evaluated on multiple datasets. Experiments show that the framework performs well on devices. Additionally, SPA-LST can achieve results close to the original model with lower transmission latency.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) proposing the SPA framework for efficient on-device deployment of large language models; (2) introducing a classifier to selectively use adapters to improve efficiency; and (3) demonstrating the performance of SPA across multiple datasets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Side Plugin Adaption (SPA): The proposed framework for deploying large language models on devices using adapters to incorporate user-specific features.

- Cloud-base and on-devices collaboration: The overall concept of collaborating between a cloud server with a large pretrained model and adapters/small models on edge devices. 

- Adapters: Additional feedforward layers used to efficiently fine-tune large language models for downstream tasks. Help embed new knowledge while minimizing added parameters.

- Classifier: The component in SPA that decides whether to use the cloud model or edge model output during inference. Reduces latency.

- Parameter efficient transfer learning: Methods like adapters for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs using only a small subset of trainable parameters.

- On-device ML optimization: Techniques for reducing model size, latency, memory and computation costs to deploy models on devices. Quantization, distillation, compression/pruning etc.

- Generative tasks: Tasks like text summarization, question answering that generate text outputs. SPA is evaluated on such downstream NLP tasks.

In summary, the key focus is on efficient deployment of large pre-trained language models on resource constrained edge devices via adapters and classifiers, to collaborate between the cloud and device for optimized inference.
