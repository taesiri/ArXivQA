# [Benchmarking and Analyzing Robust Point Cloud Recognition: Bag of Tricks   for Defending Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16361)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research questions and hypotheses appear to be:- How vulnerable are deep neural networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud recognition to adversarial examples? - Can existing defense strategies effectively counter adversarial attacks on point clouds? What are their limitations?- Is it possible to construct a robust defense framework against point cloud adversarial attacks by combining effective defense techniques?The authors argue that existing point cloud attacks and defenses have three main limitations:1) They rely on unrealistic white-box attack/defense scenarios where the adversary has full access to the model. 2) There is a lack of a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate adversarial robustness. 3) Existing defense strategies have poor generalization against diverse adversarial example types.To address these limitations, the main hypotheses tested are:- A hybrid training approach that combines different types of adversarial examples can enhance robustness compared to prior augmentation methods.- Integrating effective defense modules like statistical outlier removal (SOR), 3D reconstruction, and hybrid training can construct a robust defense framework.The paper aims to comprehensively evaluate point cloud attacks/defenses, propose improvements, and derive findings to guide future research towards more robust point cloud recognition models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The paper proposes the first comprehensive and systematic point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark. The benchmark provides a unified evaluation protocol and metrics to enable fair comparison of attacks and defenses for point cloud deep neural networks. 2. The paper collects and evaluates various defense tricks like pre-processing, reconstruction, and augmentation methods through extensive experiments. Based on the analysis, the paper identifies effective defense components and integrates them to construct a robust defense framework that achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness.3. The paper proposes a hybrid training augmentation method that considers diverse types of point cloud adversarial attacks during training to improve robustness. Experiments show this hybrid training approach outperforms existing augmentation techniques.4. Through the benchmark evaluation and experiments, the paper provides several new findings and insights regarding the transferability, imperceptibility, and effectiveness of different point cloud attacks and defenses. In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the first comprehensive point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark along with extensive experiments and analysis to identify effective defense strategies, leading to a robust defense framework and new understandings that can guide future research. The benchmark and codebase developed are also valuable contributions to the community.
