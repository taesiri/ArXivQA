# [Benchmarking and Analyzing Robust Point Cloud Recognition: Bag of Tricks
  for Defending Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16361)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research questions and hypotheses appear to be:

- How vulnerable are deep neural networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud recognition to adversarial examples? 

- Can existing defense strategies effectively counter adversarial attacks on point clouds? What are their limitations?

- Is it possible to construct a robust defense framework against point cloud adversarial attacks by combining effective defense techniques?

The authors argue that existing point cloud attacks and defenses have three main limitations:

1) They rely on unrealistic white-box attack/defense scenarios where the adversary has full access to the model. 

2) There is a lack of a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate adversarial robustness. 

3) Existing defense strategies have poor generalization against diverse adversarial example types.

To address these limitations, the main hypotheses tested are:

- A hybrid training approach that combines different types of adversarial examples can enhance robustness compared to prior augmentation methods.

- Integrating effective defense modules like statistical outlier removal (SOR), 3D reconstruction, and hybrid training can construct a robust defense framework.

The paper aims to comprehensively evaluate point cloud attacks/defenses, propose improvements, and derive findings to guide future research towards more robust point cloud recognition models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper proposes the first comprehensive and systematic point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark. The benchmark provides a unified evaluation protocol and metrics to enable fair comparison of attacks and defenses for point cloud deep neural networks. 

2. The paper collects and evaluates various defense tricks like pre-processing, reconstruction, and augmentation methods through extensive experiments. Based on the analysis, the paper identifies effective defense components and integrates them to construct a robust defense framework that achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness.

3. The paper proposes a hybrid training augmentation method that considers diverse types of point cloud adversarial attacks during training to improve robustness. Experiments show this hybrid training approach outperforms existing augmentation techniques.

4. Through the benchmark evaluation and experiments, the paper provides several new findings and insights regarding the transferability, imperceptibility, and effectiveness of different point cloud attacks and defenses. 

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the first comprehensive point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark along with extensive experiments and analysis to identify effective defense strategies, leading to a robust defense framework and new understandings that can guide future research. The benchmark and codebase developed are also valuable contributions to the community.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on adversarial attacks and defenses for 3D point cloud recognition:

- This paper establishes a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating adversarial robustness of point cloud DNNs than prior work. It includes a wider range of attack methods (11 vs 1-3 in prior papers) and defense strategies (8 vs 1-2 typically) to enable more rigorous analysis. 

- The paper provides a systematic evaluation and comparison of various defense components like preprocessing, reconstruction networks, and data augmentation. This modular analysis is more comprehensive than most prior work that tend to focus on a single defense strategy.

- The proposed hybrid training data augmentation method combining multiple attack types is novel. Most prior augmentation-based defenses just used one attack method like PGD for adversarial training. Evaluations show this hybrid approach improves robustness over single augmentation methods.

- The attacks are evaluated in a black-box setting which better reflects real-world conditions than white-box attacks commonly used in prior work. However, transferability of adversarial examples between models is still limited.

- Compared to general robustness benchmarks like ModelNet-C, this work is focused specifically on adversarial (worst-case) perturbations rather than random corruptions. This allows more systematic analysis of adversarial examples.

- While model architectures tested are standard ones like PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN etc., the benchmarking framework is extensible to include newer models. But most novel models proposed haven't yet been included.

Overall, the standardized benchmarking protocol and analysis of defenses in this paper are more comprehensive than prior work. The hybrid training approach also shows promise for improving robustness. However, developing more broadly effective defenses against diverse adversarial attacks on point clouds remains an open challenge.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Designing more transferable adversarial examples for point cloud models. The paper found that current point cloud adversarial examples have limited transferability compared to 2D image examples. Further research is needed to develop attacks that can transfer better across different model architectures and training settings. 

- Reducing the training costs of hybrid training and other robust training methods. The hybrid training defense proposed in the paper is effective but computationally expensive. New techniques to reduce the costs while maintaining accuracy would be valuable.

- Enriching the point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark with more model architectures, attacks and defenses over time. The authors encourage the research community to contribute implementations to expand the benchmark and further advance the field.

- Investigating more advanced 3D reconstruction networks for improving adversarial robustness. The performance of ConvONet in the experiments suggests reconstruction ability is important for defense. More research can explore how reconstruction networks can help defend point cloud models.

- Developing robust training techniques that combine different modalities of adversarial examples like the hybrid training method. Combining different attacks like adding, removing and shifting points may lead to defenses that generalize better.

- Exploring how geometric properties and inductive biases can make point cloud models more inherently robust. Understanding model robustness in terms of geometric principles could lead to new architectures.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more transferable and imperceptible attacks, reducing training costs of defenses, expanding the benchmark, leveraging reconstruction techniques, combining adversarial modalities, and analyzing geometric model properties. Advancing these areas could significantly improve the robustness and security of point cloud models.
