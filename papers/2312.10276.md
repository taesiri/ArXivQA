# [Asymmetric Norms to Approximate the Minimum Action Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10276)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of learning goal-conditioned policies in reward-free reinforcement learning. Specifically, it focuses on learning a representation of states such that the distance between state embeddings corresponds to the minimum number of actions needed to transition between states (Minimum Action Distance or MAD). Learning such a representation allows goal-conditioned planning by minimizing the distance between the current state and goal state in the embedding space. However, prior methods that use symmetric norms to embed states fail to capture asymmetry in transition dynamics, hurting planning performance.

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to learn an asymmetric embedding of states using Wide Norms, which can model both symmetric and asymmetric distances. This allows accurately approximating the asymmetric MAD even in environments with inherent asymmetry. In addition, the paper proposes learning a transition model in the embedding space to enable planning by optimizing distances to goal states.  

Key Contributions:

- Formalizes the notion of Minimum Action Distance (MAD) which measures the minimum actions needed to transition between pairs of states

- Shows how to learn an approximation of MAD from state trajectories using a constrained optimization objective 

- Introduces the use of asymmetric Wide Norms to embed MAD, unlike prior work that relied on symmetric norms

- Proposes an approach to learn action conditioned transition models in the embedding space  

- Empirically demonstrates that asymmetric Wide Norm embeddings can accurately capture MAD in both symmetric and asymmetric MDPs, outperforming methods based on symmetric norms

- Provides useful state representations and transition models to enable goal conditioned policy learning in reward-free RL

In summary, the key innovation is an asymmetric state representation learning approach that can provably approximate minimum action distances even in asymmetric MDPs. This representation enables planning to satisfy goals specified as target states.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes learning an asymmetric state representation for reward-free MDPs that accurately approximates the minimum number of actions needed to transition between state pairs, enabling effective goal-conditioned planning even in environments with inherent asymmetry.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an asymmetric norm parametrization to approximate the minimum action distance (MAD) between states in Markov decision processes (MDPs). 

Specifically, the paper:

- Formalizes the notion of minimum action distance (MAD), which corresponds to the minimum number of action steps needed to transition between any pair of states in an MDP.

- Shows that the MAD is inherently asymmetric and does not satisfy the symmetry property of norms.

- Presents a method to learn an approximate MAD embedding using symmetric norms (e.g. L1 norm), but shows this is insufficient for asymmetric MDPs.

- Introduces the use of asymmetric wide norms to parameterize the MAD embedding, enabling accurate approximation of the asymmetric MAD in asymmetric MDPs.

- Empirically demonstrates that the asymmetric wide norm parametrization matches the ground truth MAD in asymmetric MDPs, while the symmetric L1 norm fails.

So in summary, the key contribution is using asymmetric wide norms to learn state embeddings that accurately represent the inherent asymmetry in the minimum action distance between states in asymmetric MDPs. This representation enables more effective planning and policy learning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and contents, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Minimum Action Distance (MAD): A measure defined as the minimum number of decision steps to transition between any pair of states in a Markov decision process (MDP).

- Asymmetric distance function: The MAD is characterized as an asymmetric distance function to capture directional transitions in asymmetric MDPs.  

- State embeddings: Learning parametric state embeddings such that distances between embedded state pairs correspond to the MAD between those states.

- Asymmetric norm parametrization: Introducing asymmetry into the norm used to compute distances between embedded states, enabling better MAD approximation in asymmetric MDPs.  

- Goal-conditioned policies: Using the learned asymmetric state embeddings and MAD to enable planning and goal reaching.

- Symmetric vs. asymmetric environments: Comparing performance of symmetric and asymmetric norms/embeddings on both symmetric and asymmetric MDPs.

So in summary, key ideas have to do with approximating minimum action distances using learned asymmetric state embeddings, with a focus on handling inherent asymmetry in environments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning an asymmetric embedding of states to approximate the minimum action distance (MAD). Why is an asymmetric embedding more suitable for this task compared to a symmetric embedding? What are the limitations of using a symmetric embedding?

2. The paper introduces the concept of trajectory distance (TD) between states along a trajectory. How does the trajectory distance provide an upper bound for the minimum action distance? Why is this relationship useful?

3. The paper formulates the problem of learning the MAD embedding as a constrained optimization problem first and then converts it into an unconstrained loss with a penalty term. Walk through the details of this formulation. What is the motivation behind this approach?

4. Explain what a Wide Norm is and how it can represent both symmetric and asymmetric norms/semi-norms. How does using a Wide Norm allow enforcing the triangle inequality in the learned state embedding?

5. The MAD embedding is combined with a learned transition model to enable planning. Explain how the planning process works by minimizing distances in the latent space. What are the advantages of planning in the learned embedding space?

6. Analyze the objective function for learning the transition model in Equation 8. What properties should this learned model satisfy so that effective planning can be performed using latent space distances?

7. The empirical evaluation compares L1 norm and WideNorm embeddings on both symmetric and asymmetric environments. Summarize the results. What can we conclude about the two embedding methods based on these experiments?  

8. Can you think of other asymmetric environments where using an asymmetric embedding would be beneficial compared to a symmetric embedding? What kinds of tasks might favor asymmetric embeddings?

9. The method relies on passively collected uncontrolled trajectories. How might the quality and diversity of trajectories impact learning of the MAD embedding? When might active data collection be more suitable?

10. The paper focuses on finite MDPs. What complications arise when trying to apply this method to environments with continuous state spaces? How might the approach be extended?
