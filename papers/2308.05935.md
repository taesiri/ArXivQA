# [LittleMu: Deploying an Online Virtual Teaching Assistant via   Heterogeneous Sources Integration and Chain of Teach Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05935)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 After reviewing the paper, it appears the main research question is: How can we develop an effective virtual teaching assistant (VTA) to provide question answering and conversational services for students in online Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)?

The key challenges outlined are:

- Integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources to answer a wide range of questions.

- Answering complex questions that require reasoning beyond simple retrieval. 

- Developing an easily adaptable VTA that can generalize to new courses without heavy retraining. 

To address these challenges, the paper proposes "LittleMu", a two-stage VTA system consisting of:

1) A retrieval module that integrates structured, semi-structured, and unstructured knowledge sources using a concept-aware ranking metric.

2) A generation module that uses prompting techniques to exploit large pre-trained language models to handle complex questions and chit-chat without course-specific fine-tuning.

The central hypothesis seems to be that by combining heterogeneous knowledge retrieval with prompt-based generation, they can develop an effective and transferable VTA to provide better interactivity for MOOC learners. The paper presents both offline evaluations and real-world deployment results to demonstrate LittleMu's performance on this task.

In summary, the key research question is how to build an effective and generalizable VTA, and the main hypothesis is that integrating retrieval with prompting techniques can achieve this goal. The paper presents the LittleMu system as a solution and provides empirical results to validate its effectiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

1. The paper presents LittleMu, a virtual teaching assistant system to provide question answering and chat services for students on MOOC platforms. 

2. LittleMu has two main modules - heterogeneous retrieval and prompt-based generation. The retrieval module integrates knowledge from structured, semi-structured and unstructured sources to answer simple questions. The generation module uses prompts to exploit pre-trained language models for complex reasoning and chit-chat.

3. The paper designs a "Chain of Teach" prompting method to guide language models to provide explainable reasoning for complex questions, utilizing retrieved concepts. 

4. The paper conducts both offline evaluations and online deployment of LittleMu on the XuetangX MOOC platform. Results show improvements in dialogue coherence, informativeness, helpfulness compared to baseline models. 

5. Since deployment in 2020, LittleMu has served over 80,000 users with 300,000 queries across 500+ courses on XuetangX. This demonstrates the applicability and scalability of the system.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating an integrated retrieval-generation framework for knowledge-grounded virtual teaching assistants on MOOCs, with innovations in knowledge integration and instructional prompting. The large-scale deployment proves its effectiveness in real-world online education scenarios.
