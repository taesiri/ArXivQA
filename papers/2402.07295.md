# [Training Heterogeneous Client Models using Knowledge Distillation in   Serverless Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning models across distributed clients while keeping data decentralized. Existing FL systems assume all clients have the same global model architecture. However, this assumption fails to address challenges like computational heterogeneity and statistical data heterogeneity in practical FL systems.

- Computational heterogeneity refers to clients having different compute, memory and storage capacities. Enforcing a complex global model on resource-constrained clients is infeasible. 

- Statistical data heterogeneity refers to differences in feature distributions, class imbalances and biases across different clients' private data. In extreme cases of heterogeneity, enforcing a uniform global model leads to poor performance due to high variance among client models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using knowledge distillation (KD) to enable heterogeneous client models in serverless FL. KD facilitates transfer of knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a smaller, efficient student model via softened outputs rather than raw model parameters.

- The paper adapts and optimizes two conventional federated KD algorithms called FedMD and FedDF to work efficiently in a serverless setting using functions-as-a-service (FaaS).

- Novel optimized serverless workflows are designed for FedMD and FedDF that leverage FaaS functions for clients and introduce parallelism in certain steps using distributed computing frameworks like Ray.

Contributions:
- First system to demonstrate training of heterogeneous client models via KD in serverless FL

- Extensions to open-source system FedLess to support model heterogeneity and optimized KD training

- Comprehensive analysis of FedMD and FedDF in serverless setting across multiple datasets and model architectures for accuracy, timing and costs

- Demonstrated FedDF is faster, incur lower costs and more robust to extreme non-IID data than FedMD

In summary, the paper enables heterogeneous clients in practical FL systems via serverless knowledge distillation, making the training process more efficient and affordable.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes novel optimized serverless workflows for two popular conventional federated learning knowledge distillation techniques, FedMD and FedDF, integrates them into the open-source FedLess system through extensions, and evaluates their convergence, accuracy, performance, and costs across multiple datasets using heterogeneous client models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing novel optimized serverless workflows for two popular conventional knowledge distillation (KD) techniques in federated learning (FL), namely FedMD and FedDF. 

2) Implementing the two workflows by introducing several extensions to an open-source serverless FL system called FedLess. This represents the first system to support training heterogeneous client models using serverless KD.

3) Comprehensively evaluating the implemented strategies on multiple datasets across varying levels of client data heterogeneity using heterogeneous client model architectures with respect to accuracy, fine-grained training times, and costs.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing, implementing, and evaluating serverless workflows to enable knowledge distillation for heterogeneous client models in federated learning using a serverless system.
