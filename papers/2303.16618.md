# [Personalised Language Modelling of Screen Characters Using Rich Metadata   Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16618)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions are:

1) RQ1 (in Section 3.1): How can rich character profiles be used to model the characters' speaking styles? 

2) RQ2 (in Section 3.2): How can a language model be personalized for a specific character solely by learning from data for characters with similar profiles?

3) RQ3 (in Section 3.3): Which character metadata are the most cost-effective for personalization?

The key hypothesis seems to be that rich metadata about characters and productions can be leveraged to personalize language models in a scalable manner, allowing them to better capture individual speaking styles and patterns compared to a one-size-fits-all model. The authors test this hypothesis by training personalized models on two corpora with rich annotations, evaluating their ability to model seen and unseen speakers, and analyzing the cost-effectiveness of different annotation types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Cornell-rich dataset: The paper introduces Cornell-rich, a new dataset that contains rich metadata annotations (e.g. gender, age, profession, quotes) for characters in the Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus. This allows linking dialogue utterances to detailed speaker profiles.

2. Language model personalization: The paper shows how to leverage the rich metadata in Cornell-rich to personalize language models for individual speakers. Their proposed LMCue model uses the metadata embeddings as context to adapt the generated text. This approach improves perplexity over non-personalized LMs and performs comparably to speaker-specific fine-tuning.

3. Zero-shot transfer: The paper demonstrates that LMCue can generalize to unseen speakers at test time, relying only on their metadata profile rather than requiring speaker-specific fine-tuning data. This makes the approach more robust for new characters.

4. Cost-benefit analysis: An analysis is provided of which metadata attributes are most useful for personalization versus how costly they are to collect. Textual attributes like quotes and descriptions are found to be most cost-effective.

In summary, the key contributions are introducing a new rich dialogue dataset, proposing a metadata-based method to personalize language models, showing it can generalize zero-shot, and analyzing the cost-effectiveness of different metadata attributes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a richly annotated dialogue dataset called Cornell-rich, and shows how leveraging speaker and production metadata as context can be used to build personalized language models that adapt their predictions based on the input context, reducing perplexity and working comparably to speaker-specific fine-tuning approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper introduces a new richly annotated dataset called Cornell-rich for personalizing language models. Many prior works have used less rich metadata for personalization, often just age and gender. The Cornell-rich dataset provides much richer speaker profiles with 14 distinct types of metadata. This allows for more thorough investigation of metadata-based personalization.

- The paper shows strong perplexity reductions from incorporating speaker profiles into an adapted Transformer architecture called LMCue. Prior work has shown perplexity gains from using simpler metadata, but the richer profiles here allow for larger gains of up to 6.5% over baselines.

- For unseen test speakers, the paper still shows solid perplexity reductions and speaker modeling ability using the metadata, whereas most prior work assumes some speaker-specific data is available. This shows the approach generalizes better to new speakers.

- The paper examines the cost-effectiveness of different annotation types. This provides useful insights for where to focus annotator time and resources. Descriptions and quotes are shown to be most useful.

- The adaptation approach works by learning associations between metadata profiles and language patterns. Some recent work has tried instead to distill speaker attributes explicitly as latent variables or embeddings. The results here seem competitive without that added complexity.

Overall, the paper pushes forward metadata-based personalization in language modeling by using much richer annotations than prior work. It also provides novel analysis of cost-effectiveness and generalizability that move the field forward. The adapted Transformer approach delivers strong results, demonstrating the utility of rich profiles for personalization even without speaker-specific data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluate the proposed approach on other dialogue datasets/domains beyond movies and TV shows. The authors suggest it would be interesting to see if similar metadata-based personalization is effective for other genres like books, plays, etc. 

- Explore using additional types of metadata not considered in this work, such as information about characters' speech patterns, accents, education level, etc. The authors believe an even richer set of annotations could further improve personalization.

- Conduct experiments with other model architectures and objectives beyond the standard transformer encoder-decoder models used in this work. The authors suggest exploring recurrent networks, BERT-style models, and other objectives like mutual information maximization.

- Explore personalization for other NLP tasks beyond language modeling, such as dialogue generation, translation, summarization, etc. The authors propose their metadata-based personalization approach could be beneficial in other text generation settings.

- Develop better evaluation metrics beyond perplexity and speaker MRR to more directly measure improvements in language modeling from personalization. The authors suggest this is an open research question.

- Conduct further analysis into why certain metadata attributes are more useful than others through ablation studies. The relative usefulness of different attributes is still not fully understood.

- Explore personalization in a multilingual setting by leveraging metadata annotations in different languages. The authors suggest this could be a promising direction.

In summary, the main future directions focus on applying and evaluating the proposed personalization approach on new datasets, tasks, models, and languages, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of which metadata attributes are most useful through further analysis and annotation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method for personalizing language models for screen characters using rich metadata annotations. The key points are:

- They create a new dataset called Cornell-rich which contains manual annotations for 863 characters from the Cornell Movie Dialog corpus, including gender, age, profession, description, quotes, etc. They also collect metadata for most of the source films. 

- They propose an architecture called LMCue which takes speaker and production metadata as input to an encoder, and generates personalized text. This performs better than baseline LMs, with perplexity reductions of 5-6%.

- LMCue works well for adapting to new, unseen speakers in a zero-shot setting by relying on metadata. It achieves speaker mean reciprocal rank scores showing the model assigns highest probability to the correct speaker's dialogue.

- They analyze which metadata attributes are most cost-effective for reducing perplexity vs annotation effort. Textual attributes like quotes and descriptions are much more useful than discrete attributes like gender and age.

- Overall, the paper shows rich metadata can be leveraged to personalize language models and scale to unseen speakers, reducing the need for fine-tuning on dialogue samples. The new Cornell-rich dataset facilitates further research in this area.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to build personalized language models for characters in TV shows and movies by leveraging rich metadata about the characters and productions. They introduce a new dataset called Cornell-rich which contains detailed annotations for over 800 characters from the existing Cornell Movie Dialog corpus. The annotations include gender, age, profession, description, quotes, etc. They also collect metadata about the films such as genre, writers, release year, etc. 

They experiment with an encoder-decoder transformer architecture called LMCue which takes embeddings of the metadata as input to the encoder and is trained to predict the character's dialogue. They show that using the metadata about speaker and production significantly improves perplexity over baseline language models. The method works well even for new, unseen speakers by relying on their metadata. They also analyze which metadata attributes are most useful for personalization vs their annotation cost. Key findings are that textual attributes like quotes and descriptions are very effective, while discrete attributes like gender have lower utility. The personalized models are able to capture nuances of character speech based on their profiles.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes using rich metadata annotations about movie characters and films to personalize language models for scripted dialogue. The authors collect a new dataset called Cornell-rich, which augments the existing Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus with manual annotations capturing 14 metadata fields for characters, including gender, age, profession, description, and quotes. They also collect 6 automatically extracted metadata fields for the source films. They then train a Transformer-based language model called LMCue where the encoder takes as input contextual embedding vectors representing the speaker and production metadata. These metadata embedding vectors are obtained by pooling the outputs of a MiniLM model fine-tuned as a sentence encoder on the metadata fields. At test time, providing the metadata for a particular speaker personalizes the language model to predict the types of utterances that speaker is likely to say. The authors show this metadata-based personalization approach reduces perplexity compared to non-personalized models, and works well even for completely unseen speakers by relying on their metadata profile similarity to seen speakers. They also do an analysis of which metadata fields are most useful for personalization compared to the annotation cost.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to leverage rich metadata annotations of characters and films/TV shows to personalize language models for predicting dialogue. Specifically, it aims to answer the following research questions:

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a method for personalizing language models to capture individual speaking styles by leveraging rich metadata annotations. The authors contribute a new dataset called Cornell-rich, which augments the Cornell Movie Dialog corpus with 14 metadata fields like age, gender, profession, religion and descriptive quotes for over 800 speaking characters. They also propose an architecture called LMCue that utilizes these metadata fields as input embeddings to condition text generation. Experiments demonstrate that LMCue reduces perplexity by 5-6% on in-domain test sets compared to a baseline LM, performing similarly to speaker-specific fine-tuning. Remarkably, it also generalizes well to unseen speakers in a zero-shot setting when relying solely on their metadata profile to capture speaking style. The authors evaluate which metadata fields are most useful for personalization, finding rich textual attributes like character descriptions and quotes to be more beneficial than categorical fields like gender and age bracket. Overall, this work effectively shows how diverse metadata can be exploited to build personalized language models that are sensitive to speaker context, even for new individuals at test time.

 The paper proposes using rich metadata annotations for characters and films/TV shows to personalize language models in a scalable manner, improving perplexity compared to non-personalized models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using rich metadata annotations about characters and films/TV shows to personalize language models for generating scripted dialogue. The authors collect a new dataset called Cornell-rich, which augments the Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus with detailed speaker profiles (e.g. age, gender, profession, quotes) for over 800 characters across hundreds of films. They also use an in-house TV show dataset with similar metadata. The proposed LMCue model leverages these annotations as context vectors to bias its predictions towards the speaking style of individual characters. Experiments show LMCue reduces perplexity by 5-6% over strong baselines, and performs similarly to finetuning on speaker dialogue when available. LMCue also transfers reasonably well to unseen speakers in a zero-shot setting. The results suggest rich textual metadata like character descriptions and quotes are most useful for personalization. Overall, the paper demonstrates the value of contextual metadata for adapting language models to generate personalized, character-appropriate dialogue without needing speaker-specific finetuning.
