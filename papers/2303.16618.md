# Personalised Language Modelling of Screen Characters Using Rich Metadata   Annotations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions are:1) RQ1 (in Section 3.1): How can rich character profiles be used to model the characters' speaking styles? 2) RQ2 (in Section 3.2): How can a language model be personalized for a specific character solely by learning from data for characters with similar profiles?3) RQ3 (in Section 3.3): Which character metadata are the most cost-effective for personalization?The key hypothesis seems to be that rich metadata about characters and productions can be leveraged to personalize language models in a scalable manner, allowing them to better capture individual speaking styles and patterns compared to a one-size-fits-all model. The authors test this hypothesis by training personalized models on two corpora with rich annotations, evaluating their ability to model seen and unseen speakers, and analyzing the cost-effectiveness of different annotation types.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Cornell-rich dataset: The paper introduces Cornell-rich, a new dataset that contains rich metadata annotations (e.g. gender, age, profession, quotes) for characters in the Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus. This allows linking dialogue utterances to detailed speaker profiles.2. Language model personalization: The paper shows how to leverage the rich metadata in Cornell-rich to personalize language models for individual speakers. Their proposed LMCue model uses the metadata embeddings as context to adapt the generated text. This approach improves perplexity over non-personalized LMs and performs comparably to speaker-specific fine-tuning.3. Zero-shot transfer: The paper demonstrates that LMCue can generalize to unseen speakers at test time, relying only on their metadata profile rather than requiring speaker-specific fine-tuning data. This makes the approach more robust for new characters.4. Cost-benefit analysis: An analysis is provided of which metadata attributes are most useful for personalization versus how costly they are to collect. Textual attributes like quotes and descriptions are found to be most cost-effective.In summary, the key contributions are introducing a new rich dialogue dataset, proposing a metadata-based method to personalize language models, showing it can generalize zero-shot, and analyzing the cost-effectiveness of different metadata attributes.
