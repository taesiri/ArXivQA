# [On the Efficient Marginalization of Probabilistic Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04005)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on developing efficient methods to extract probabilistic beliefs from autoregressive sequential models, beyond just next-step predictions. Autoregressive models are commonly used to model sequential data, factorizing joint distributions into conditional distributions of next steps given previous history. While they are often used just for one-step ahead forecasting, the models encode richer beliefs over longer-range future possibilities that are not utilized. Exactly computing these long-range probabilities is challenging, as it requires marginalizing over many intermediate steps.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper develops novel techniques to efficiently estimate a variety of probabilistic queries from autoregressive models, including hitting times, ordering of events, probability of regions being visited in a certain sequence, etc. This is done for various classes of sequential models (discrete sequences, temporal point processes, stochastic jump processes) using importance sampling to estimate probabilities by sampling restricted futures that avoid potential query-violating cases. Analytic solutions are derived for simpler model classes, while sampling-based estimators are shown to dramatically reduce variance across model types. Crucially, all methods rely solely on access to the next-step conditional distributions and sampling, ensuring broad applicability without retraining models.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of probabilistic query classes for discrete sequences, temporal point processes, and stochastic jump processes
- Analytical solutions derived for queries on Markovian sequence models
- Novel importance sampling-based estimators for hitting times and more complex probabilistic queries, with theoretical efficiency guarantees 
- Methods to handle missing data in temporal point processes via principled marginalization 
- Introduction of generalized hitting times for stochastic jump processes and tractable estimation procedures
- Empirical validation across real-world data spanning text, human behavior, climate, finance demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in variance

In summary, the paper enables extracting rich beliefs from existing autoregressive models through efficient and broadly-applicable marginalization techniques, unlocking their applicability for complex probabilistic queries without requiring model retraining.
