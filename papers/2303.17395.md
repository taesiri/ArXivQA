## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2-paragraph summary of the key points from the research paper:

The paper proposes WavCaps, a new weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset containing around 400k audio clips paired with captions generated from raw online descriptions using ChatGPT. To build this dataset, audio clips and raw textual descriptions were collected from various web sources including FreeSound, BBC Sound Effects, SoundBible, and a subset of AudioSet. The raw web descriptions underwent a 3-stage pipeline to filter out irrelevant data and convert descriptions into natural sentence captions. First, basic filtering removed very short clips and repetitive descriptions. Next, ChatGPT took the noisy raw text and generated concise, sound-focused captions after removing location details, people names, etc. Finally, post-processing refined any remaining issues in the ChatGPT captions. 

Experiments demonstrate the value of the large-scale WavCaps dataset. Models trained on WavCaps achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream audio-language tasks including retrieval, captioning, zero-shot classification, and text-to-sound generation. For example, an HTSAT-BERT model achieved top results on retrieval using WavCaps pretraining. Ablations highlight the impact of processing raw web text into higher-quality captions using ChatGPT. Overall, the work introduces a new large-scale audio captioning resource created with an innovative ChatGPT data processing pipeline. Experiments validate the dataset's ability to advance audio-language multimodal research across diverse tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a three-stage processing pipeline to create a large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset called WavCaps. First, minimal pre-filtering is applied to remove very short clips and highly repetitive raw descriptions from the harvested web data. Next, the authors employ ChatGPT to further filter and transform the remaining raw descriptions into proper caption-like sentences. ChatGPT is provided prompts and examples to remove extraneous details, convert non-sentences to complete sentences, and summarize descriptions into concise captions. Finally, a post-processing stage uses named entity recognition to identify and remove any remaining unwanted details like numbers and names. This three stage process results in around 400k audio clips with corresponding descriptive captions suitable for multimodal learning tasks. By utilizing ChatGPT's natural language understanding capabilities, the authors are able to process noisy web data into a large-scale, high-quality dataset without extensive manual effort or a high discard rate.
