## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents the 6th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition, part of a workshop held with CVPR 2024. The competition aims to advance techniques for understanding human emotions and behaviors from facial and speech data. There are 5 sub-challenges:

1) Valence-Arousal Estimation: Estimate continuous valence (positive to negative) and arousal (active to passive) values from videos in the Aff-Wild2 database. Only valence-arousal annotations can be used for model training. 

2) Expression Recognition: Classify video frames into 1 of 8 facial expression categories (6 basic expressions + neutral + other) using Aff-Wild2 data. Only expression labels can be used for training.

3) Action Unit Detection: Detect 12 facial action units in individual video frames from Aff-Wild2. Only action unit annotations can be used for training.  

4) Compound Expression Recognition: Recognize 7 compound expression classes in the C-EXPR-DB database. Any existing data/models can be used for training.

5) Emotional Mimicry Intensity: Estimate intensity of 6 emotions in the Hume-Vidmimic2 multimodal dataset.

For the first 3 challenges, baseline systems using ResNet50 and VGG16 architectures are presented, utilizing datasets splits provided. Preprocessing via RetinaFace face detection and alignment is also described. Evaluation metrics for each task are detailed, including CCC, F1 scores, and Pearson correlation. 

The paper gives comprehensive details on the competition corpora, evaluation protocols, and baseline results to allow participants to develop improved techniques for these facial analysis tasks. The competition aims to advance multimodal emotion recognition and benchmark new techniques.
