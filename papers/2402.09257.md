# [TDViT: Temporal Dilated Video Transformer for Dense Video Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09257)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing video models (3D CNNs or transformers) are designed for sparse video tasks (one prediction per video) but have challenges when adapted to dense video tasks (one prediction per frame), including:
    1) High computational cost, limiting deployment
    2) Less effective with redundant frames 
    3) Difficult to capture long-range temporal correlations
- Current state-of-the-art methods for dense video tasks use hybrid solutions with 2D image models + temporal modules, instead of end-to-end 3D models

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Temporal Dilated Video Transformer (TDViT) as an end-to-end backbone for dense video tasks 
- Key component is a temporal dilated transformer block (TDTB) which has:
    1) Memory structure to store previous frame features  
    2) Temporal dilation to control sampling frequency and reduce redundancy
    3) Query tokens from current frame, key/values from memory â†’ efficient multi-frame modeling
- Hierarchical TDTBs enable exponentially expanded temporal receptive field to capture long-range correlations  

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end transformer backbone designed specifically for dense video tasks
- TDTB enables efficient multi-frame feature extraction, handles redundancy, captures long-range patterns
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency on ImageNet VID (object detection) and YouTube VIS (instance segmentation)
- Simple yet effective design allows TDViT to serve as a general-purpose dense video backbone

In summary, the paper proposes a novel temporal dilated video transformer tailored for dense video tasks, with architectural innovations for efficiency, redundancy handling, and modeling longer temporal dynamics. Experiments validate superior performance.
