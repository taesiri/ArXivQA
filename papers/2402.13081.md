# [IT Intrusion Detection Using Statistical Learning and Testbed   Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13081)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of automated intrusion detection in an IT infrastructure. Specifically, it considers the challenges of (1) identifying the start time of an attack, (2) predicting the type of attack, and (3) predicting the sequence of actions an attacker takes during the attack. Traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems are difficult to maintain against evolving attacks. Hence, the authors investigate statistical learning methods that can automatically learn models from data.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) for mapping sequences of infrastructure measurements and alerts to sequences of predicted attacker actions. They introduce a machine learning pipeline that reduces the high-dimensional observation space to a small set of features to make the methods computationally feasible. The models are trained on a large dataset collected from an in-house emulation testbed on which various attack scenarios are executed.

Key Contributions:

- Systematic comparative study of HMM, LSTM and RFC for predicting attack start time, type, and action sequence in a realistic IT infrastructure setting.

- Collection of a large labeled dataset from an emulation testbed with implemented attack scenarios. Introduction of a pipeline for reducing the dimensionality of the measurement space.

- Insight that small sets of IDS alerts and server statistics are sufficient for accurate automated prediction. LSTM outperforms HMM and RFC but requires more training data and resources.

- Demonstration that HMM provides high prediction accuracy comparable to LSTM in this setting. HMM supports both supervised and unsupervised learning as well as online prediction.

In summary, the paper provides a feasible automated intrusion detection approach based on HMM that can leverage IDS alerts and predict attacks with high accuracy given sufficient training data. The testbed environment allows for systematic evaluation unavailable in related work.
