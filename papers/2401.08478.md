# [Solving Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning with Decision   Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08478)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of continual offline reinforcement learning (CORL), which combines continuous learning and offline RL. CORL aims to enable agents to learn multiple tasks from static offline datasets without forgetting prior tasks. A key challenge is balancing plasticity (ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks) and stability (preventing forgetting of old tasks). Existing CORL methods use actor-critic structures and experience replay, but suffer from distribution shifts, low efficiency, and limited knowledge sharing. 

Solution:
The paper proposes using Decision Transformer (DT), an offline RL method based on transformers, as a more suitable framework for CORL. Experiments show DT offers benefits like faster learning, avoiding distribution shift issues, and better generalization. However, vanilla DT suffers from more serious forgetting during supervised updates. To address this, two DT variants are introduced:

1. Multi-Head DT (MH-DT): Uses multiple heads to store task-specific knowledge and shares common components. Adds distillation loss and selective rehearsal to enhance learning on current task.

2. Low-Rank Adaptation DT (LoRA-DT): Merges less influential DT weights for sharing and adapts the crucial MLP layer via low-rank tuning. Saves the adapted parameters to avoid forgetting.

Main Contributions:

- First work to propose DT as a suitable framework for CORL and analyze its advantages and disadvantages.

- MH-DT leverages multiple heads, distillation loss and selective rehearsal to balance plasticity and stability when replay buffers are available.

- LoRA-DT shares knowledge via weight merging and adapts crucial parts of DT to new tasks, while saving parameters to prevent forgetting when buffers are unavailable.

- Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show the proposed methods outperform prior CORL techniques in sample efficiency, forgetting metrics, and knowledge sharing.

In summary, the key innovation is using DT's transformer structure to facilitate continuous learning across offline RL tasks, while mitigating its forgetting issue through task-specific heads and efficient parameter adaptation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using Decision Transformer as a more suitable offline continuous learner for balancing plasticity and stability in continual offline reinforcement learning, and introduces methods to mitigate Decision Transformer's catastrophic forgetting issue when learning sequentially from static datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. The authors propose that compared to offline RL methods employing the Actor-Critic structure, methods utilizing Decision Transformer (DT) as the foundational model are better suited for addressing the continual offline RL (CORL) problem. They point out the advantages of DT and problems that need to be solved in the CORL setting.

2. When the replay buffer is available, the authors propose a multi-head DT (MH-DT) method to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem of DT. MH-DT stores task-specific knowledge in separate heads and facilitates knowledge sharing with common components. It also employs distillation and selective rehearsal to enhance current task learning.

3. When the replay buffer is unavailable, the authors propose a low-rank adaptation DT (LoRA-DT) method. LoRA-DT merges less influential weights for knowledge sharing and fine-tunes the decisive MLP layer in DT blocks with LoRA to adapt to the current task. This avoids substantial forgetting and saves memory.

4. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DT-based methods outperform state-of-the-art CORL baselines on various continuous control tasks in terms of standard evaluation metrics. The experiments also showcase the enhanced learning capabilities and superior memory efficiency of the methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing DT-based methods MH-DT and LoRA-DT to address the CORL problem, which demonstrate improved performance over prior methods.

- Distillation loss
- Selective rehearsal
- Low-rank adaptation DT (LoRA-DT)

The paper proposes using Decision Transformer models rather than traditional actor-critic methods for continual offline RL, in order to mitigate issues like distribution shift. Key contributions include introducing a multi-head DT model with distillation loss and selective rehearsal when a replay buffer is available, and a low-rank adaptation DT method when there is no replay buffer. Comparisons are made to prior CORL algorithms on benchmark environments. The main focus is balancing plasticity and stability in the context of avoiding catastrophic forgetting, through Decision Transformer adaptations.
