# [Advancing Generative AI for Portuguese with Open Decoder Gervásio PT*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of large, open source language models specifically optimized for handling Portuguese language. Existing models are either closed source, restricted for commercial use, only cover one variant of Portuguese (Brazilian or European), or lack proper documentation.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors fine-tune the open source LLaMA-2 model by continuing its pre-training on Portuguese data to create the Gervásio-PT model. 
- Gervásio-PT has 7 billion parameters and comes in two variants tailored for Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese.
- The model is trained on machine translated GLUE and SuperGLUE datasets plus additional datasets created specifically for Portuguese.
- It is fully open source, released under MIT license without restrictions, fully documented, and matches state-of-the-art performance.

Main Contributions:
- Gervásio-PT - a 7B parameter decoder-based transformer model for Portuguese that is open source, achieves SOTA results, available in both Brazilian and European variants.
- New Portuguese datasets for pre-training - translated GLUE, SuperGLUE sets plus augmented versions.
- Performance matches or exceeds existing models like Sabaia-7B despite being fully open source and free for commercial use.
- Sets new SOTA for open source Portuguese models. Enables further research/innovation in Portuguese NLP.

In summary, the paper presents Gervásio-PT, an open source Portuguese language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by fine-tuning LLaMA-2 model on new Portuguese datasets. It is fully documented, available in 2 variants and advances Portuguese NLP capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Gervásio PT, the first competitive, fully open 7 billion parameter decoder-based Transformer model specifically improved for both European and Brazilian Portuguese through instruction tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting new open-source transformer-based decoder models specifically developed and optimized for the Portuguese language. The models, called "Gervásio PT", are 7 billion parameter decoders covering both European and Brazilian Portuguese. They outperform other publicly available models of similar size and represent the current state-of-the-art in open decoders for Portuguese. 

The paper also introduces the instruction tuning datasets created specifically to train these models, which are also openly released to support further research. The models and data aim to advance natural language processing capacity for Portuguese by being fully open and documented, allowing community access and improvement.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What was the motivation behind developing instruction-tuned models specifically for the Portuguese language? Why focus on Portuguese instead of other languages?

2. The paper mentions resorting to tasks and datasets from GLUE and SuperGLUE - what was the rationale behind selecting only certain tasks like MRPC and excluding others like COLA? What linguistic considerations guided that selection process?  

3. The paper talks about machine translating the selected GLUE/SuperGLUE datasets into European and Brazilian Portuguese - what translation system was used and why? What steps were taken to ensure the quality and suitability of the resulting translated datasets?

4. For the instruction templates crafted for each task, what was the process of manually creating them? How did the authors determine the optimal phrasing, terminology, and approach for formulating the instructions?

5. In the augmented training datasets utilizing techniques like question generation and excerpt generation, what methods and systems were leveraged to augment the data? Were any validations performed on the augmented data?

6. The paper states Gervásio models exhibit better performance on textual similarity and inference tasks versus question answering - why might that be the case? Does the training data account for that discrepancy at all?

7. What are some of the unique challenges faced in evaluating generative Portuguese language models compared to more traditional classifiers? How does the free-generation nature impact determining correctness?

8. Since Gervásio models outperform Sabiá on some metrics despite Sabiá's more constrained answer selection approach, what conclusions can be drawn in terms of the generative capacity?

9. With the model openly available under an MIT license, what new research opportunities are enabled by having full access to an open, documented, state-of-the-art Portuguese language model?

10. Given that consumer-grade hardware can still run 7 billion parameter models like Gervásio, how might ongoing hardware advancements continue expanding access and usable scale for generative Portuguese models?
