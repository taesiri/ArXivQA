# [TigerBot: An Open Multilingual Multitask LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08688)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem and Motivation:
Recently there has been extremely rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), with breakthroughs from both proprietary models like GPT-3 and open-source models like Llama. The authors aim to further push the progress by introducing TigerBot, a new family of open-source LLMs ranging from 7 billion to 180 billion parameters. 

The goals are to achieve state-of-the-art performance, make LLMs more accessible by keeping costs low, cover more languages beyond just English, and focus on real-world applications.

Proposed Solution - TigerBot Models:
- Pretrained decoder-only transformer models based on Llama and BLOOM architectures
- Sizes of 7B, 13B, 70B and 180B parameters 
- Trained on a diverse 500B token multilingual dataset focusing on Chinese and English
- Both base and task-focused "chat" models released
- Quantized down to 4-bit and dynamic quantization for efficient deployment

Key Innovations:
- Careful data filtering and cleaning for higher quality 
- Combining multiple forms of parallelism and optimizations for efficient large scale training
- Adding a small portion of supervised data into pretraining for better instruction following
- Recursive prompt-based approaches for summarization and other tasks 
- Role-playing through retrieval augmented generation for game NPCs

Outcomes:
- Outperforms Llama and leading benchmarks across various datasets and languages
- Entire model pipeline from data to training to deployment covered
- Shared detailed methodology to spur open innovation 
- Suite of tools and real-world applications demonstrated

In summary, the authors push forward open-source LLMs in terms of scale and efficiency while keeping costs low, cover more languages, focus on practical use cases, extensively share knowledge, and achieve state-of-the-art results.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a special tokenization method to improve Chinese and other Asian language representation in the tokenizer. Can you explain in more detail how this tokenization approach works and why it is beneficial?

2. When discussing the training framework optimizations, the paper states that smaller tensor parallelism sizes yield better global efficiency. What is the reasoning behind this? How does tensor parallelism across nodes negatively impact efficiency?

3. For the holistic training approach, what is the methodology behind mixing a small portion of instruction completion data into the pretraining data? How does this lead to improved instruction following capabilities before alignment learning? 

4. When covering long sequence capabilities, the paper discusses differences between interpolation techniques like Dynamic and YaRN for position embeddings extrapolation. Can you explain what the key differences are and why the TigerBot approach can improve output consistency?

5. In the section on reinforcement learning with human feedback, the paper utilizes rejection sampling and direct preference optimization. Can you explain why direct preference optimization was chosen over other policy gradient methods? What are the advantages?

6. When discussing training hardware, the paper mentions using NVLink and RoCE for intra-node and inter-node GPU connectivity. Why are these interconnect technologies important for large scale model training?

7. For the evaluation methodology, can you explain the reasoning behind using next token prediction on a subset of data during training? What insights does this provide over full benchmark evaluation?

8. In the long context QA application, the paper employs a filtering approach to narrow down relevant context segments. How does this query-guided filtering work and why is it advantageous over standard dense retrieval?

9. For the function calling application, what techniques are used during pretraining and finetuning to improve structured data extraction capabilities critical for argument extraction? 

10. When describing the role playing application, why is an extraction and retrieval augmented approach used instead of just finetuning? What are the benefits of this methodology?
