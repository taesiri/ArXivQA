# [MMMModal -- Multi-Images Multi-Audio Multi-turn Multi-Modal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11297)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal models lack capability to handle multiple images, multiple audio inputs and multi-turn dialogues within a single session. 
- There is a lack of multimodal datasets that incorporate multi-images, multi-audio and multi-turn interactions.
- Little consideration has been given to developing multimodal models tailored for the Malaysian context.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces MMMModal, a bilingual multimodal large language model capable of understanding multi-images, multi-audio and combinations thereof within a multi-turn dialogue. 
- Two model sizes are proposed - TinyLlama (1.1B parameters) and Mistral (7B parameters).
- A systematic data generation methodology is utilized to create tailored synthetic datasets encompassing multi-image, multi-audio and multi-turn instructions for English and Malay.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of MMMModal, an advanced multimodal LLM tailored for multi-images, multi-audio and multi-turn interactions.
- Creation of synthetic datasets for audio instructions, visual Malaysian context, multi-images relationships, multi-audio relationships and multi-images-multi-audio relationships. 
- A two-stage training procedure involving pretraining for feature alignment and finetuning using synthetic instruction datasets.
- Qualitative examples demonstrating MMMModal's capability in processing queries across diverse modalities and turns.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions through MMMModal and its systematic data generation techniques to advance multimodal modeling capabilities for the unique Malaysian context. Both model architecture and data curation account for multi-images, multi-audio and conversational understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces MMMModal, a multimodal large language model capable of comprehending multi-images, multi-audio, and multi-images-multi-audio within a single multiturn dialogue session.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing MMMModal, a multimodal large language model designed to comprehend multi-images, multi-audio, and multi-images-multi-audio within a single multiturn session. The key highlights are:

1) It introduces a groundbreaking multimodal large language model capable of handling multiple images, multiple audio inputs, and combinations of both in a conversational, multi-turn setting. 

2) It utilizes state-of-the-art visual and audio encoders (SigLIP and Whisper) along with alignment pretraining and finetuning to enable seamless integration of diverse modalities.

3) Two versions are unveiled - TinyLlama (1.1B parameters) and Mistral (7B parameters). Both are bilingual, supporting English and Malay simultaneously.

4) It presents methods for generating synthetic datasets tailored for multi-image, multi-audio, multi-turn interactions in the Malaysian context.

5) It demonstrates the model's capabilities through examples of comprehending and reasoning across multi-images, multi-audio and combinations within a single multiturn session.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling a single multimodal LLM to handle multi-turn interactions across multiple images, multiple audio inputs and combinations, with a focus on the Malaysian and bilingual context.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions adopting a two-stage training approach for creating an effective multimodal model. Can you elaborate on why this two-step process of pretraining for feature alignment and then finetuning is more effective than end-to-end training? 

2. In Section 3.1 on generating synthetic audio instruction datasets, you describe utilizing the Mixtral model to generate multi-turn dialogues based on the audio context. What modifications or constraints did you impose on Mixtral to ensure the dialogues produced were natural, relevant and aligned with the audio content?

3. When preprocessing the audio data in Section 2, why did you choose to use the Whisper encoder specifically? What unique capabilities did it provide over other speech/audio encoders in extracting features suitable for your approach?

4. The paper talks about introducing new tokens like <image> and </image> to mark the projected visual output. What challenges did you face in learning and filling in these image spans during training and how did you overcome them? 

5. You have tested two versions of the model - TinyLlama and Mistral. What were the factors and tradeoffs considered when deciding on the model sizes in terms of number of parameters?

6. In section 5.2 on Instruction Finetuning, you mention the issue of data shuffling across devices leading to inconsistent gradients. How exactly does your proposed solution of adding empty image/audio placeholders resolve this problem during distributed, multi-GPU training?

7. What quantitative results and metrics could better validate the efficacy of your approach over baseline multimodal models? Are there any benchmark datasets that this model was evaluated on?

8. How does your synthetic multi-images/audio relationship dataset generation methodology ensure coverage of varied, nuanced and complex relationships between the multi-modal contents?

9. You mention supporting both English and Malay simultaneously in a bilingual setting. What modifications were made to the training process or model architecture to enable bidirectional translations and code-switching between languages?

10. The conclusion mentions potential future work like incorporating videos. What are the engineering and data challenges to be addressed in extending this model to support video understanding along with existing modalities?
