# [Dictionary Learning Improves Patch-Free Circuit Discovery in Mechanistic   Interpretability: A Case Study on Othello-GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12201)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Interpreting complex behaviors of transformer models like language generation remains challenging due to the "superposition hypothesis", where models cram more features into a representation space than its dimensions. 
- Existing methods for finding interpretable circuits rely on activation patching/ablation, which can cause out-of-distribution issues and quadratic complexity.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use sparse dictionary learning to decompose activations into more interpretable additive features. 
- Decompose outputs of modules writing to residual stream (embeddings, attention, MLPs).  
- Trace information flow from any activation back to lower-level features through linearized attention and approximate direct contribution for MLPs.
- Discover interpretable circuits in a patch-free manner with linear complexity.

Contributions:
- Compare choices of where to decompose dictionaries. Claim decomposing residual stream modules is preferred.  
- Apply dictionary learning to find interpretable Othello game features automatically.
- Discover meaningful Othello circuits tracing information flow across moves and board positions. 
- First work finding transformers' interpretable circuits without relying on activation patching/ablation.
- Achieves optimal linear complexity and avoids out-of-distribution issues.

In summary, the paper proposes using dictionary learning for patch-free circuit discovery in transformers, with applications to understanding an Othello game playing model. The method traces information flow across interpretable features in a linear complexity manner while avoiding distribution shift issues.
