# [Enhancing LLM-Based Coding Tools through Native Integration of   IDE-Derived Static Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03630)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper addresses the problem of repository-level code completion using large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown success in code completion tasks, they struggle with repository-level completion as they lack cross-file context beyond a single file. Existing approaches try to identify and integrate cross-file contexts into the LLMs, but have limitations in accuracy and relevance of contexts, as well as properly fusing contexts while respecting LLM length limitations. 

The paper proposes a new framework called IDECoder that utilizes the native static analysis and linting capabilities of integrated development environments (IDEs) to enhance LLMs for repository-level completion. Specifically, IDECoder leverages IDE features like symbol tables and reference indexing to accurately identify relevant cross-file contexts reflecting developer intentions. It collects docstrings and method/class signatures from user code (not just full code) to provide a concise yet informative cross-file context. IDECoder uses a chain-of-thought methodology to model the context sequentially for the LLM. Finally, IDECoder refines the LLM's code completion output using IDE linting to ensure correctness and quality.

The main contributions are: 1) Accurate identification of cross-file contexts using IDE analysis features, ensuring relevance. 2) Concise fusion of contexts via docstrings/signatures to inform LLMs without exceeding length limits. 3) Sequential context modeling using chain-of-thought to generate coherent completions. 4) Self-refinement of completed code using IDE linting feedback. Preliminary experiments validate improved performance over baseline approaches. The integration of IDE information and diagnostic outputs is a promising direction to enhance LLMs for repository-level code intelligence tasks.
