 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Boosting Few-Shot Learning via Attentive Feature Regularization":

Problem: 
Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to classify novel categories with limited labeled data. A common approach is to extract features from a pre-trained model and use them to train a classifier. However, the feature representation ability is limited due to the scarcity of data. Although manifold regularization methods like Mixup and CutMix can improve performance, they mix features randomly which can introduce irrelevant noise and weaken discriminative patterns.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Attentive Feature Regularization (AFR) to enhance the representativeness and discriminability of features for few-shot classification. The key ideas are:

1) Use semantic similarity to select relevant base categories to regularize novel features instead of random selection. This reduces unrelated noise. 

2) Design instance-level attention to leverage complementary information from the selected base categories through adaptive interpolation. This avoids weakening the novel patterns during mixing.

3) Introduce channel-level attention to emphasize discriminative channels in the regularized features, helping the classifier focus on representative content. 

4) Combine instance-level and channel-level attentions into an end-to-end framework for attentive feature regularization.

Main Contributions:

- Purposeful selection of base categories using semantic knowledge instead of random selection for better regularization.

- Instance attention to adaptively integrate complementary base information without diluting novel patterns.  

- Channel attention to highlight discriminative channels in mixed features.

- State-of-the-art performance on Mini-ImageNet, Tiered-ImageNet and Meta-Dataset, especially in 1-shot setting. 

- Consistent performance gains when combined with existing methods like Meta Baseline, FRN, BML etc. showing wide applicability.
