# [APT: Adaptive Pruning and Tuning Pretrained Language Models for   Efficient Training and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12200)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) is expensive in terms of memory and compute resources. 
- Existing methods either reduce training costs (e.g. parameter-efficient fine-tuning) or inference costs (e.g. model pruning), but not both.
- Simply combining these methods (pruning + efficient tuning) leads to substantial performance loss or extra training costs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Adaptive Pruning and Tuning (APT), which adaptively identifies parameters to prune and tune during fine-tuning. 
- APT uses a lightweight salience metric to score parameter importance and prune unimportant ones early in training.
- It also dynamically adds more tuning parameters in salient LM layers to recover performance.
- APT uses a self-distillation loss to further improve performance of the pruned LM with low overhead.

Key Contributions:
- APT provides both training efficiency (8x faster, 70% less memory) and inference efficiency (2.4x faster, 78% less memory) over strong baselines when pruning RoBERTa and T5.
- When pruning large LLMs like LLaMA-13B, APT maintains 86% performance with 70% sparsity and only 30% fine-tuning memory cost.
- Ablations validate the adaptive pruning, tuning and distillation components. Analysis shows early pruning and controlled tuning improve efficiency.
- APT shapes a new paradigm for efficiently pruning LMs under limited resources, making large LMs more accessible.

In summary, APT co-optimizes for efficiency and accuracy when pruning LMs by adaptively identifying what and when to prune/tune parameters based on importance, enabling significant resource savings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes APT, an adaptive pruning and tuning method that improves the efficiency of language model training and inference by dynamically identifying salient parameters to tune while pruning irrelevant ones based on a lightweight outlier-aware scoring function.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing APT (Adaptive Pruning and Tuning), a method that adaptively identifies model parameters for pruning and fine-tuning during language model training. The key benefits highlighted are:

1) APT prunes small language models faster while pruning large models with less memory consumption compared to prior methods. For example, it prunes RoBERTa and T5 8x faster than the LoRA + pruning baseline.

2) APT maintains high task performance when aggressively pruning models. For instance, it maintains 98% of RoBERTa and T5 performance with only 40% of parameters left. For the large LLaMA model, it keeps 86.4% performance with 70% parameters remaining.

3) APT reduces the training memory footprint substantially. It uses only 30% memory compared to the state-of-the-art pruning method for LLaMA and 70% memory relative to fine-tuning for RoBERTa and T5.

4) APT improves both training and inference efficiency through its adaptive pruning and tuning of parameters based on a salience scoring function. This allows removing irrelevant parameters early while recovering performance by adding parameters in salient tuning layers.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the APT method for efficient language model pruning and fine-tuning during training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Adaptive Pruning and Tuning (APT): The proposed method to dynamically prune less salient parameters and add more tuning parameters during language model fine-tuning. Aims to improve both training and inference efficiency.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT): Methods like adapters and LoRA that update only a small subset of parameters to reduce fine-tuning memory usage. 

- Structured pruning: Removing consistent blocks of parameters like attention heads or feedforward layers to improve inference speed.

- Training efficiency: Measured in terms of faster convergence (time to accuracy) and lower peak memory usage during fine-tuning. 

- Inference efficiency: Measured by higher throughput (sequences processed per second) and lower peak memory usage during inference.

- Salience scoring: Quantifying the importance of parameters for a task by looking at the magnitude of their contribution to the loss. Used to determine what to prune.

- Self-distillation: Sharing parameters between the teacher and student network during knowledge distillation to avoid duplicate memory costs.

- Adaptive tuning: Dynamically adding more tuning parameters to salient adapter layers during fine-tuning to recover performance of the pruned model.
