# [Distributed Model Predictive Control for Cooperative Multirotor Landing   on Uncrewed Surface Vessel in Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of safely landing a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) that is travelling through waves. This is a difficult problem for two main reasons: (1) it requires coordination between the vehicles with limited communication, and (2) the motion of the USV in waves makes identifying a safe landing location and timing challenging.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel sequential distributed model predictive control (MPC) scheme. The key idea is that instead of communicating full planned trajectories between vehicles, each vehicle has its own tracking MPC that incorporates an additional "artificial" goal location. The vehicles exchange these artificial goal locations in order to cooperatively determine a consensus landing location and timing. Furthermore, the MPCs leverage a spatial-temporal wave model to help select a landing location and time on the USV when the tilt angle is minimized, enabling a smooth landing.   

Main Contributions:
1. A distributed MPC framework for safe UAV-USV cooperative landing that integrates a spatial-temporal wave model to coordinate both the location and timing of landing.

2. Demonstrated in simulation the ability of the approach to simultaneously achieve consensus on a landing location between vehicles and time the UAV landing to occur when the USV tilt angle is small for a smooth landing.

The key novelty is the integration of the spatial-temporal wave model into the distributed MPC scheme, allowing the vehicles to cooperatively determine both where and when to land the UAV on the moving USV in waves in a decentralized manner with minimal communication between vehicles. Simulations showcase the performance of the approach.
