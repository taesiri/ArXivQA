# [Distributed Model Predictive Control for Cooperative Multirotor Landing   on Uncrewed Surface Vessel in Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of safely landing a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) that is travelling through waves. This is a difficult problem for two main reasons: (1) it requires coordination between the vehicles with limited communication, and (2) the motion of the USV in waves makes identifying a safe landing location and timing challenging.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel sequential distributed model predictive control (MPC) scheme. The key idea is that instead of communicating full planned trajectories between vehicles, each vehicle has its own tracking MPC that incorporates an additional "artificial" goal location. The vehicles exchange these artificial goal locations in order to cooperatively determine a consensus landing location and timing. Furthermore, the MPCs leverage a spatial-temporal wave model to help select a landing location and time on the USV when the tilt angle is minimized, enabling a smooth landing.   

Main Contributions:
1. A distributed MPC framework for safe UAV-USV cooperative landing that integrates a spatial-temporal wave model to coordinate both the location and timing of landing.

2. Demonstrated in simulation the ability of the approach to simultaneously achieve consensus on a landing location between vehicles and time the UAV landing to occur when the USV tilt angle is small for a smooth landing.

The key novelty is the integration of the spatial-temporal wave model into the distributed MPC scheme, allowing the vehicles to cooperatively determine both where and when to land the UAV on the moving USV in waves in a decentralized manner with minimal communication between vehicles. Simulations showcase the performance of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel distributed model predictive control strategy for cooperative multirotor landing on an uncrewed surface vessel that leverages a spatial-temporal wave model to simultaneously find a consensus landing location in real-time between the vehicles and optimize the timing of landing to minimize tilt of the surface vessel due to waves.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The development of a novel distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework for safe unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) - uncrewed surface vessel (USV) cooperative landing that leverages a spatial-temporal wave model. 

2) Demonstrating in simulation how the proposed approach can simultaneously coordinate in real-time both a safe landing location and execute the landing task for a UAV on a USV under wave conditions.

Specifically, the paper proposes a distributed MPC scheme that combines standard tracking MPCs for the UAV and USV with additional artificial intermediate goal locations to enable cooperation. The key novelty is the integration of a spatial-temporal wave model that maps location and time to the tilt of the USV. The proposed MPC framework is shown to simultaneously find a consensus safe landing location between the UAV and USV, track this landing goal, and time the UAV's landing to limit severe tilt of the USV caused by waves.

The paper proposes a distributed model predictive control approach for enabling the safe cooperative landing of a multirotor UAV on a moving uncrewed surface vessel in waves. Key aspects include optimizing a safe landing location and timing using spatial-temporal wave models, integrating consensus algorithms to enable cooperation between the vehicles, and handling communication delays/losses.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a sequential distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme. What are the key advantages of formulating the cooperative control problem this way compared to using a centralized MPC?

2. The paper introduces artificial intermediate goals for both the multirotor and USV that are sequentially optimized. Explain the motivation behind this approach and why it enables consensus without explicit trajectory sharing between vehicles. 

3. The spatial-temporal wave model is a key component of the proposed approach. Discuss how this model is leveraged in the MPC formulations and the specific costs designed to enable both spatial and temporal cooperation.  

4. What is the effect of the weighting parameters $\lambda_s$ and $\lambda_m$ on the cooperative strategy? Explore the trade-offs involved in tuning these parameters.

5. The paper demonstrates robustness to communication losses between vehicles. Analyze the underlying reasons why the consensus is maintained during these losses and the behaviors of each vehicle.

6. Compare and contrast the three cooperative strategies presented in the results: "Cooperative", "Calm" and "Ride the Wave". What are the relative advantages and limitations of each one?  

7. The safe landing conditions play an important role in activating the multirotor's tilt cost. Critically analyze if alternative conditions could be used and their potential impact.

8. Discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, including assumptions made and areas for improvement in future work.

9. The spatial-temporal wave model is assumed known in this work. Speculate how an online learned model may impact or be integrated into the cooperative control scheme.

10. The results are demonstrated in simulation. Discuss challenges associated with implementation on real hardware and experimental validation.
