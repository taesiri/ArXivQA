# [FengWu-GHR: Learning the Kilometer-scale Medium-range Global Weather   Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Developing high-resolution global weather forecast models is critical for more accurate predictions, especially of extreme weather events. However, existing ML models are limited to low resolutions due to lack of training data and computational constraints.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FengWu-GHR, the first ML-based global weather forecast model with 0.09Â° resolution, close to the operational IFS-HRES model.

- A meta model based on Vision Transformer is first pre-trained on low-resolution data. 

- A Spatial Identical Mapping Extrapolation (SIME) method allows the model to operate on high-resolution data by decomposing it into multiple low-resolution samples that preserve spatial mappings.

- Decompositional and Combinational Transfer Learning (DCTL) further enhances the model by enabling it to capture small-scale weather patterns from high-resolution analysis data.

- Low-Rank Adaptation helps reduce error accumulation over long forecast horizons.

Main Contributions:

- FengWu-GHR reaches over 9x higher resolution compared to previous ML weather models, with over 4 billion parameters.

- It demonstrates superior performance over IFS-HRES and other models across various metrics like RMSE, ACC, bias and activity over multiple variables and pressure levels.

- Notably, it predicts extreme events like heatwaves and winter storms more accurately and with longer lead times compared to other models. 

- The framework enables advancing other ML weather models to higher resolutions with minimal additional data requirements.

- FengWu-GHR produces the most detailed and reliable operational weather forecasts to date using ML approaches. Its high resolution unlocks finer-grained predictions to guide decision making across sectors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents FengWu-GHR, the first machine learning-based global weather forecasting model operating at a high resolution of around 9km, which introduces novel methods to tackle key challenges like lacking high-resolution training data and achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing leading numerical weather prediction models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting FengWu-GHR, the first machine learning-based global weather forecasting model operating at a high spatial resolution of around 9km. Specifically, the paper highlights three key contributions:

1) FengWu-GHR achieves the highest resolution among existing ML-based weather forecasting models, effectively enhancing the grid density by approximately eightfold compared to prior advanced AI models. 

2) It has the largest number of learnable parameters (over 4 billion) among existing forecasting models in atmospheric science. 

3) The methodologies introduced in FengWu-GHR, such as the spatial identical mapping extrapolate (SIME) method and the decompositional and combinational transfer learning (DCTL) approach, provide a general framework to upgrade ML-based weather forecast models from low to high resolution with minimal cost while preserving excellent performance.

In summary, FengWu-GHR spearheads the transition of large-scale weather forecasting models into the high-resolution era, delivering more accurate and detailed weather predictions compared to state-of-the-art physical and data-driven global forecasting models.
