# [Data Acquisition via Experimental Design for Decentralized Data Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13893)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Acquiring high-quality training data is critical for current ML models, especially in data-scarce domains like healthcare. Data markets incentivize data sellers to supply more data by allowing buyers to purchase valuable data points. 
- However, selecting the most useful data points from sellers in a decentralized way is challenging. Prior data valuation techniques assume centralized data access or use a validation set, which can overfit.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a federated data selection approach for buyers inspired by linear experimental design. 
- The key insight is to directly estimate the benefit of acquiring seller data for improving test set predictions, avoiding issues with using a validation set. 
- They formulate an optimization problem to maximize prediction accuracy on the buyer's unlabeled test data under a budget constraint.
- The gradient and objective function can be computed locally using only the buyer's test point and each seller's individual data point.
- They employ the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to efficiently solve this in an iterative, federated manner with minimal communication.

Main Contributions:
- Analyze issues with current data valuation methods like overfitting and centralized access assumptions.
- Formulate a novel data acquisition procedure based on experimental design that uses buyer test data.
- Design a scalable federated algorithm using Frank-Wolfe optimization.
- Demonstrate improved test accuracy and efficiency over baselines on several real-world medical datasets.
- Provide both a multi-step variant and fast single-step approximation.

In summary, this paper proposes a decentralized data selection technique for data markets that directly estimates the value of seller data for improving buyer test set predictions. This avoids issues with typical data valuation approaches and can be optimized efficiently in a federated manner.
