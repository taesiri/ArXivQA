# [RobotGPT: Robot Manipulation Learning from ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01421)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promising capabilities for robotic control through natural language. However, directly executing the code generated by ChatGPT on robots can be unpredictable and unsafe. ChatGPT lacks an understanding of the physical constraints and limitations of robots, and may provide inconsistent outputs for the same input.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a framework called RobotGPT that utilizes ChatGPT's intelligence to assist in robotic manipulation tasks, while prioritizing stability and safety. The key ideas are:

1) An effective prompting structure to help ChatGPT deeply understand the environment, available APIs, task goals etc. This includes background context, objects info, environment info, task specifics and examples.  

2) A self-correction module that executes the code line-by-line to catch runtime errors, asks ChatGPT to fix them, and iterates until successful.

3) Getting another ChatGPT instance to generate eval code for verifying task success. Humans check the correctness of this eval code.

4) Using the verified ChatGPT code to generate demonstrations for training a robotic manipulation agent through imitation learning. This results in a more reliable RobotGPT agent.

Main Contributions:

1) Explored an effective prompting structure to unlock ChatGPT's capabilities for robotic planning. Tested tasks of varying difficulties to analyze ChatGPT's limitations.

2) Proposed a RobotGPT framework that absorbs ChatGPT's intelligence into a robotic agent through imitation learning. This achieves an average of 91.5% task success rate compared to 38.5% by directly using ChatGPT.

3) Demonstrated RobotGPT's ability to collect demonstration data in simulation and achieve stable performance when deployed to real robots.

4) Conducted an AB testing with humans which showed RobotGPT's advantages in solving open-ended tasks compared to non-LLM methods.

Overall, this paper provides valuable insights into effectively utilizing ChatGPT for robotics by combining it with imitation learning to achieve predictable and safe systems. The RobotGPT framework ensures stability while leveraging the knowledge and creativity from large language models.
