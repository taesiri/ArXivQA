## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Causally graph Attention network for Trimming heterophilic graph (CAT) to improve the node classification performance of graph attention networks (GATs) on heterophilic graphs. The key idea is that enabling the central node to concentrate more on itself while reducing the distraction caused by some neighbors can avoid the discrimination ability degradation of GATs on heterophilic graphs. Specifically, the CAT method leverages causal inference to estimate the distraction effect of neighbors on the central node's attention learning process. It then identifies and removes high distraction neighbors, which are viewed as "distraction neighbors". This graph trimming process allows the GAT model to achieve better node classification by maintaining high self-attention for the central node. Extensive experiments on seven heterophilic graph datasets demonstrate that the proposed CAT method can significantly boost the performance of various GAT models for node classification, without needing to alter the original GAT architectures. The CAT framework is model-agnostic and can be readily applied to any local attention-based GAT models. Overall, this work provides a novel graph trimming perspective to address the challenge of applying GATs on heterophilic graphs.
