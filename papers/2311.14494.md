# [MVControl: Adding Conditional Control to Multi-view Diffusion for   Controllable Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14494)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes MVControl, a novel neural network architecture for controllable text-to-multi-view image generation. The method builds on top of MVDream, a pretrained multi-view diffusion model. A trainable control network module is designed to incorporate spatial control signals like edge maps, interacting with the frozen base model to enable conditional text-to-multi-view image synthesis. A new conditioning mechanism is introduced to handle both local and global control based on the input conditions. Once trained, MVControl can provide multi-view consistent 3D guidance for controllable text-to-3D generation via score distillation optimization. A two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization strategy is employed - first optimizing geometry guided by the hybrid diffusion prior from MVControl and Stable Diffusion, then extracting and fixing it to optimize texture details at a higher resolution. Experiments demonstrate MVControl's ability to generate high-quality, controllable multi-view images and 3D assets given spatial conditions like edge maps along with text prompts. The method advances controllable generation for multi-view images and 3D content.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called MVControl that enhances existing multi-view 2D diffusion models by incorporating additional input conditions like edge maps to enable controllable generation of multi-view images and view-consistent 3D content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel network architecture called MVControl to achieve fine-grain controlled text-to-multi-view image generation.

2. Once MVControl is trained, it can be exploited to serve as a part of a hybrid diffusion prior for controllable text-to-3D content generation via score distillation sampling (SDS) optimization. 

3. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that the proposed method is able to deliver high-fidelity multi-view images and 3D assets, which can be fine-grain controlled by an input condition image (e.g. edge map) and text prompt.

4. Discussing that besides being used for controllable 3D generation, MVControl could benefit the general 3D vision/graphics community for various application scenarios in the future.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the MVControl network architecture and methodology for controlled text-to-multi-view and text-to-3D generation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel conditioning mechanism that predicts an embedding to encapsulate the input spatial and view conditions. Can you explain in more detail how this embedding is predicted and how it enables control over the generated images both locally and globally? 

2. The paper exploits a hybrid diffusion prior relying on both a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model and the trained MVControl network during the 3D asset generation process. What are the rationales behind using this hybrid prior instead of just the MVControl network? What are the advantages?

3. The method performs a coarse-to-fine 3D asset generation process consisting of a coarse stage and a fine stage. Why is this two-stage approach beneficial compared to a single-stage approach? What specific representations and objectives are used in each stage? 

4. How does the paper deal with the mismatch between the relative camera poses used in the conditioning module and the absolute poses used to pre-train the base MVDream model? Explain the role of the additional network M2 in bridging this gap. 

5. What dataset(s) are used to train the MVControl network? What are the major considerations and preprocessing steps involved in preparing the training data? 

6. The method can generate controllable multi-view images given an edge map as input condition. What other types of spatial conditions (e.g. depth, sketch) could likely be used without modification to the approach? Would any change to the network architecture be required?

7. Explain the formulation behind the hybrid SDS loss calculation in Eq. 4. What are λ1 and λ2 and how should their values be set? What factors do they control?

8. How does the method quantitatively evaluate the quality of the generated 3D assets? What specific metrics are reported? What are the limitations of these metrics?  

9. The method currently only explores generating 3D assets based on edge map conditions. What other potential application scenarios could this controllable multi-view image generation approach be beneficial for?

10. What are some of the limitations of the current method? What ideas could be explored to address these limitations in future work?
