# VORNet: Spatio-temporally Consistent Video Inpainting for Object Removal

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to remove undesired objects from videos in a spatio-temporally consistent manner. The key hypothesis is that combining optical flow warping to capture motion information with image-based inpainting models can generate higher quality and more temporally coherent video inpainting results compared to using image-based models alone.Specifically, the paper proposes a novel learning-based architecture called VORNet that combines optical flow warping and image inpainting to address the video object removal task. The main research questions and hypotheses can be summarized as:- How can optical flow warping be incorporated to propagate information between frames and improve temporal consistency for video inpainting?- Can existing image inpainting models like generative networks be adapted to generate spatially coherent content for video object removal? - Will combining optical flow warping and image inpainting in a learning framework improve both spatial and temporal consistency compared to image-based models alone?The paper introduces the VORNet architecture that combines warping, inpainting and refinement networks to test these hypotheses. Experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate VORNet's ability to generate higher quality and more temporally consistent video object removal results compared to state-of-the-art image-based or video inpainting methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing VORNet, a novel deep learning based architecture for video object removal. VORNet is the first learning-based method for this task.- Designing a combination of spatial content losses (reconstruction, perceptual, GAN) and temporal coherent loss to train the model for spatially and temporally consistent video generation. - Creating the first large-scale Synthesized Video Object Removal (SVOR) dataset based on YouTube-VOS for training and evaluation.- Achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods like patch-based video inpainting and image-based inpainting through quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluation.In summary, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for the challenging task of video object removal, enabling learning-based methods to be applied. The proposed VORNet can generate spatially and temporally coherent results by combining information from warping, inpainting and refinement networks. The SVM dataset and losses allow effective training. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of VORNet over other methods.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- This paper focuses specifically on video object removal, which aims to remove a foreground object from a video and fill in the missing region with a plausible background. This is a fairly niche research area, with limited prior work compared to image inpainting. - Most prior video inpainting methods are patch-based, which struggle with large missing regions and lack ability to generate novel content. This paper proposes the first learning-based approach using deep neural networks, allowing generating realistic appearances.- For learning methods, there is some related work on making image inpainting models temporally consistent when applying to videos. But those require the original unprocessed frames as references. This paper presents a novel architecture to train the model directly on object removed video pairs.- Compared to the only other learning-based video object removal paper by Wang et al. concurrently developed, this method can utilize state-of-the-art image inpainting models like Yu et al. for better spatial quality. It also uses more advanced loss functions like perceptual loss and temporal GAN loss.- The proposed VORNet combines strengths of warping, inpainting network, and refinement network for temporally coherent results. The large-scale synthesized dataset for training is also a contribution.- Limitations include reliance on optical flow and inefficient use of warped frames. End-to-end learned warping could be an area of improvement. But overall, this paper advances the state-of-the-art in video object removal specifically.In summary, this paper makes meaningful contributions by proposing the first deep learning approach for video object removal, an under-explored problem. The model design and training strategy demonstrate effectiveness. But there is still room for improvement as this research direction is still relatively new.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest the following future research directions:- Improving the temporal attention and warping network to replace optical flow warping. They point out limitations with using optical flow, such as extra computation time, parameters, and blurriness. They suggest designing an end-to-end trainable temporal attention and warping network could improve performance.- Extending the approach to irregular mask inpainting. The current method focuses on inpainting bounding box regions, but could be extended to handle irregular mask shapes. - Exploring unconditional video synthesis after inpainting. The paper focuses on inpainting conditioned on the input video, but suggests exploring using the model for unconditional video synthesis as future work.- Applying the method to real video object removal. The method is demonstrated on a synthesized dataset, so applying and evaluating it on real videos is noted as an important direction.- Speeding up the model for real-time usage. The current model runs at 2.5 FPS, so improving the efficiency for real-time video object removal applications is suggested. In summary, the main future directions are improving the temporal warping component, extending the approach to irregular masks, exploring unconditional synthesis, applying to real videos, and improving speed - in order to make the approach more practical for real world video editing tasks.
