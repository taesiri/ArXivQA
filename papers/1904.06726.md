# VORNet: Spatio-temporally Consistent Video Inpainting for Object Removal

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to remove undesired objects from videos in a spatio-temporally consistent manner. The key hypothesis is that combining optical flow warping to capture motion information with image-based inpainting models can generate higher quality and more temporally coherent video inpainting results compared to using image-based models alone.Specifically, the paper proposes a novel learning-based architecture called VORNet that combines optical flow warping and image inpainting to address the video object removal task. The main research questions and hypotheses can be summarized as:- How can optical flow warping be incorporated to propagate information between frames and improve temporal consistency for video inpainting?- Can existing image inpainting models like generative networks be adapted to generate spatially coherent content for video object removal? - Will combining optical flow warping and image inpainting in a learning framework improve both spatial and temporal consistency compared to image-based models alone?The paper introduces the VORNet architecture that combines warping, inpainting and refinement networks to test these hypotheses. Experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate VORNet's ability to generate higher quality and more temporally consistent video object removal results compared to state-of-the-art image-based or video inpainting methods.
