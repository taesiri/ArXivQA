# [End-to-End Diffusion Latent Optimization Improves Classifier Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13703)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we enable more flexible and precise control over image generation in denoising diffusion models using guidance from external classifiers, without needing to retrain noise-aware classifiers or rely on approximate one-step guidance signals?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By directly optimizing the diffusion noise latents with respect to a classifier loss on the final denoised pixels, more accurate and semantically meaningful guidance can be achieved compared to using gradients from a one-step denoising approximation.

2) Using an invertible diffusion process like EDICT allows backpropagation through the full denoising chain during optimization with constant memory cost, overcoming the prohibitive computational requirements of caching activations.

3) This proposed approach, Direct Optimization of Diffusion Latents (DOODL), will enable new capabilities and improved results across various forms of classifier guidance, including text conditioning, vocabulary expansion, entity personalization, and aesthetic improvement.

So in summary, the central research question is how to enable flexible classifier-based control over diffusion model generations without some of the drawbacks of prior methods, with the key hypothesis being that directly optimizing the latents end-to-end will achieve this.
