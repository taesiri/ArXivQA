# [nuScenes Knowledge Graph -- A comprehensive semantic representation of   traffic scenes for trajectory prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for trajectory prediction lack robustness, explainability and safety, partially due to only learning statistical correlations rather than causal models. 
- Most works fail to utilize rich map context which is considered important for trajectory prediction. Map information is rarely fully exploited due to limited data representations.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a comprehensive ontology to represent driving scene concepts like agents, lanes, traffic signs, etc and their hierarchies and relationships.
- Generate a knowledge graph called nSKG for the nuScenes dataset based on this ontology to provide structured scene representation.
- Construct a trajectory prediction dataset called nSTP from the knowledge graph that contains input-output pairs readily usable for training graph neural networks.  

Main Contributions:
- A rigorous agent and map ontology tailored for modelling nuScenes driving scenes
- nSKG - a large-scale knowledge graph for nuScenes with over 56 million triples capturing trajectories, map elements and their semantics
- nSTP - the first rich trajectory prediction dataset with over 40,000 examples that can directly be used to train graph networks

The key idea is to provide a structured symbolic representation of driving scenes that can enable research into neuro-symbolic methods for safe and explainable trajectory prediction. The knowledge graph and dataset aim to make the wealth of contextual information in nuScenes readily exploitable.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive ontology and knowledge graph to represent traffic scenes from the nuScenes dataset, as well as a ready-to-use trajectory prediction dataset extracted from the knowledge graph to facilitate training neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A comprehensive agent and map ontology that models driving scenes in detail.

2. nSKG, a knowledge graph generated for the nuScenes dataset, based on the defined ontology.

3. nSTP, a ready-to-use scene graph dataset for training graph neural networks (GNNs) for trajectory prediction.

So in summary, the main contributions are:

1) An ontology for modeling driving scenes
2) A knowledge graph for the nuScenes dataset based on this ontology 
3) A trajectory prediction dataset built from the knowledge graph that can be used to train GNNs

The key novelty is using knowledge graphs to provide a semantic, structured representation of driving scenes, including details on agents, map elements, trajectories, and their relationships. This representation can then be used by both symbolic and subsymbolic methods for trajectory prediction.
