# [nuScenes Knowledge Graph -- A comprehensive semantic representation of   traffic scenes for trajectory prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09676)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models for trajectory prediction lack robustness, explainability and safety, partially due to only learning statistical correlations rather than causal models. 
- Most works fail to utilize rich map context which is considered important for trajectory prediction. Map information is rarely fully exploited due to limited data representations.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a comprehensive ontology to represent driving scene concepts like agents, lanes, traffic signs, etc and their hierarchies and relationships.
- Generate a knowledge graph called nSKG for the nuScenes dataset based on this ontology to provide structured scene representation.
- Construct a trajectory prediction dataset called nSTP from the knowledge graph that contains input-output pairs readily usable for training graph neural networks.  

Main Contributions:
- A rigorous agent and map ontology tailored for modelling nuScenes driving scenes
- nSKG - a large-scale knowledge graph for nuScenes with over 56 million triples capturing trajectories, map elements and their semantics
- nSTP - the first rich trajectory prediction dataset with over 40,000 examples that can directly be used to train graph networks

The key idea is to provide a structured symbolic representation of driving scenes that can enable research into neuro-symbolic methods for safe and explainable trajectory prediction. The knowledge graph and dataset aim to make the wealth of contextual information in nuScenes readily exploitable.
