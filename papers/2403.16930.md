## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning models across decentralized edge devices without sharing their local raw data. However, FL faces the key challenge of "data incompleteness" - where some classes are underrepresented in the distributed datasets across devices. This leads to biased and inaccurate models. Common strategies like oversampling do not work well and violate privacy. There is a need for sophisticated privacy-preserving techniques to address data incompleteness.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FLIGAN, a federated learning framework that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate high-quality synthetic data and augment incomplete datasets. Key aspects:

1) Federated GAN model training: Separate GAN models are trained in federated manner for each class label using classwise sampling and grouping nodes by data volume. Helps capture complex data distributions.

2) Step-by-step synthetic data addition: GANs generate synthetic data which is incrementally added to nodes' datasets to balance class imbalance without overfitting.

3) Federated model training: Enhanced datasets are used to train an accurate and robust federated classification model.

Main Contributions:
- Novel privacy-preserving federated GAN model to generate high-quality synthetic data
- Techniques like classwise sampling and node grouping to improve GAN training 
- Methodology to incrementally inject synthetic data to augment incomplete datasets
- Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that shows improved model accuracy over baselines

The proposed FLIGAN framework effectively tackles data incompleteness in an efficient and privacy-preserving manner, while improving model accuracy significantly.
