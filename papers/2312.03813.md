# [Improving Activation Steering in Language Models with Mean-Centring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03813)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Activation steering aims to control language model outputs, but current methods either require identifying precise counterbalancing behaviors or are computationally expensive. 
- Engineers typically don't know how concepts are represented within language models, making it difficult to construct good steering vectors.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose a simple technique called "mean-centring" to create steering vectors using only a dataset exhibiting the target behavior.  
- They compute the average activation vector from running the target dataset through the model. They then subtract the average activation vector computed on the training set to remove the inherent bias.
- This residual vector captures directions related to the desired behavior and can be used to steer the model.

Main Contributions:
- The authors show mean-centring performs comparably to existing methods for making language model continuations of toxic prompts non-toxic.
- They demonstrate the versatility of mean-centring by steering story genres, a task not easily achieved with counterbalancing behaviors. Genre-specific words increase under steering.
- Applying mean-centring to extract "function vectors" that trigger capabilities significantly improves accuracy over previous baselines across various natural language tasks.

In summary, mean-centring provides an effective and simple way to leverage only a target dataset to extract steering vectors. It expands the applicability of activation steering methods to more contexts. The strong performance suggests it is a promising technique for controlling language model outputs.
