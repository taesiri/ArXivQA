# [Efficient Data Access Paths for Mixed Vector-Relational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15807)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Efficient mixed vector-relational search is challenging as it requires optimizing both relational predicate evaluation and approximate nearest neighbor search. Different access methods like scanning or using indexes have tradeoffs.

- There is a lack of guidance on selecting the best access path based on parameters like dimensionality, batch size, selectivity etc.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare three scan-based approaches - explicit SIMD vectorization, function calls, and tensor formulation 

- Analyze performance based on dimensionality, batch size and selectivity to show when each performs best

- Extend index to support predicates and compare scan vs index access paths

Key Findings:
- Explicit SIMD is best for low batch sizes where computation dominates

- Tensor formulation outperforms with high dimensionality and large batches due to better cache locality 

- Relational filtering dominates cost so explicit SIMD wins for selective predicates

- Index with pre-filtering outperforms scanning at high selectivity and large batches

- Choosing optimal access path based on parameters improves performance significantly

Main Contributions:
- First extensive study comparing scan vs index access methods for vector search under relational predicates

- Analysis and insights on when each method is most efficient

- Demonstrates need for selectivity-driven access path selection in vector databases/systems

The key insight is that judiciously selecting between different access methods based on dimensionality, batch size and predicate selectivity results in orders of magnitude better performance compared to a one-size-fits-all approach.
