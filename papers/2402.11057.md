# [Are you Struggling? Dataset and Baselines for Struggle Determination in   Assembly Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11057)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Determining when someone is struggling with a task from video is an important capability for understanding actions and skills. It could enable systems to provide real-time assistance. 
- However, struggle determination from video is an underexplored problem with no existing datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new dataset with videos of people performing 3 assembly tasks: assembling plumbing pipes, pitching tents, and solving Tower of Hanoi puzzles.
- The videos are annotated for struggle on a 4-point scale from definitely not struggling to definitely struggling. Annotations are obtained from both crowdsourcing and an expert.
- They propose 3 tasks: struggle classification, regression of struggle level, and struggle label distribution learning.
- They provide baseline results on these tasks using various deep learning architectures including 2D ConvNets, 3D ConvNets and transformer-based models.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset specifically for struggle determination with over 5 hours of video and 725K frames.
- Collection methodology balancing expert and crowd annotations.
- Formulation of struggle determination into classification, regression and label distribution learning tasks.
- Benchmark deep learning models and baseline results on the 3 struggle tasks.
- Analysis and ablation studies on the importance of temporal information.

In summary, this paper introduces a new problem of determining struggle from video, provides a dataset to support research, and defines tasks and baseline models to quantify and detect struggle. This could help build systems that recognise when someone needs assistance during complex manual tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new dataset with egocentric videos of people performing assembly tasks, annotated for struggle vs non-struggle and degree of struggle, to enable research on automated struggle determination for future assistive systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Surfacing the problem of struggle determination for finer-grained assembly understanding in egocentric videos.

2) Introducing a public dataset with three assembly activities (plumbing pipes, pitching camping tents, solving Tower of Hanoi puzzle) and corresponding annotations for struggle determination. The dataset contains about 5.1 hours of video and 725,100 frames.

3) Presenting three benchmark tasks for struggle determination using the dataset: classification (binary and 4-way), regression, and label distribution learning. All tasks use weakly supervised learning with only video-level labels. 

4) Providing initial benchmark results for several video understanding models on the struggle determination tasks, thus establishing baseline performance. The results demonstrate the importance of motion information for this task.

In summary, the main contribution is creating a novel dataset specifically for struggle determination and defining benchmark tasks and baseline results to motivate further research on this problem towards assistive systems and finer-grained video understanding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset for struggle determination. What were the key considerations and trade-offs when selecting the assembly tasks/scenarios for data collection? How might the choice of activities impact model performance?

2. The paper uses a forced 4-point rating scale for struggle annotation. What are the potential benefits and downsides compared to using a continuous rating scale or binary labels for struggle? How might this impact inter-annotator agreement?  

3. The struggle annotations rely on both expert and crowd-sourced ratings. What steps were taken to validate the reliability of the crowd-sourced ratings? How was the expert annotator selected and what domain knowledge did they leverage?

4. The paper proposes three struggle determination tasks: classification, regression, and label distribution learning. What are the key differences between these formulations and what insight does each provide about model performance? 

5. For the deep learning models, only backbones were fine-tuned while classifier heads were trained from scratch. What is the motivation behind this training strategy? How might end-to-end joint training impact performance?

6. The paper reports performance gaps between model accuracy and human baselines. What factors contribute to this gap? What modifications to the models or data could help close this gap?

7. The ablation study investigates the importance of temporal modeling via multi-frame inputs and ordered frames. How do the results support the claim that smooth motions are crucial struggle cues? What other ablation studies could provide insight?

8. Attention visualization highlights model focus on hands and active objects. Does struggle manifest differently across the three activities? How can attention patterns expose model limitations? 

9. The tent assembly task proved most challenging potentially due to complexity and outdoor setting. How could domain adaptation techniques help improve cross-task generalization?

10. The paper focuses on video-level struggle determination. How could the dataset and models be extended to support temporal localization of struggle segments within long videos?
