# [Are you Struggling? Dataset and Baselines for Struggle Determination in   Assembly Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11057)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Determining when someone is struggling with a task from video is an important capability for understanding actions and skills. It could enable systems to provide real-time assistance. 
- However, struggle determination from video is an underexplored problem with no existing datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new dataset with videos of people performing 3 assembly tasks: assembling plumbing pipes, pitching tents, and solving Tower of Hanoi puzzles.
- The videos are annotated for struggle on a 4-point scale from definitely not struggling to definitely struggling. Annotations are obtained from both crowdsourcing and an expert.
- They propose 3 tasks: struggle classification, regression of struggle level, and struggle label distribution learning.
- They provide baseline results on these tasks using various deep learning architectures including 2D ConvNets, 3D ConvNets and transformer-based models.

Main Contributions:
- First dataset specifically for struggle determination with over 5 hours of video and 725K frames.
- Collection methodology balancing expert and crowd annotations.
- Formulation of struggle determination into classification, regression and label distribution learning tasks.
- Benchmark deep learning models and baseline results on the 3 struggle tasks.
- Analysis and ablation studies on the importance of temporal information.

In summary, this paper introduces a new problem of determining struggle from video, provides a dataset to support research, and defines tasks and baseline models to quantify and detect struggle. This could help build systems that recognise when someone needs assistance during complex manual tasks.
