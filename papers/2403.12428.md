# [Transfer in Sequential Multi-armed Bandits via Reward Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers a sequential stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting where an agent interacts with the bandit over multiple episodes. The reward distributions of the arms remain fixed within an episode but can change across episodes. This models practical scenarios like changing user preferences in recommender systems over time. The goal is to leverage knowledge from previous episodes to improve the cumulative regret over all episodes.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an All Sample Transfer UCB (AST-UCB) algorithm that transfers reward samples from previous episodes to the current episode. Specifically, in addition to a regular UCB estimate using only current episode samples, an auxiliary UCB estimate using all samples is maintained. The optimistic rewards of the two estimates are combined by taking the minimum, which gives a tighter confidence interval leading to better decisions.

Main Contributions:
- Development of AST-UCB algorithm that transfers samples from previous episodes to improve regret over multiple episodes in a stochastic MAB setting.

- Regret analysis quantifying the benefit of transfer - the bound explicitly shows the reduction compared to not having transfer. Conditions on number of episodes for transfer to be beneficial are derived.

- Numerical experiments validating the proposed algorithm and showing significant regret reduction compared to UCB with no transfer, especially when episodes are "similar" (formalized through a parameter).

In summary, the paper provides an effective sample transfer framework in stochastic MABs over multiple episodes/tasks, with theoretical and empirical evidence of performance improvement. Key aspects are the AST-UCB algorithm and analysis quantifying transfer benefit.
