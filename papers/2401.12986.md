# [Crowdsourced Adaptive Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12986)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional surveys struggle to identify emerging issues or track changes in information environments. Approaches like computerized adaptive tests rely on fixed item banks, while wiki surveys may not work well for measuring attitudes on continuous scales. There is a need for more flexible and adaptive survey methods.

Solution - Crowdsourced Adaptive Survey (CSAS) Method:
The paper proposes a novel crowdsourced adaptive survey (CSAS) methodology that leverages natural language processing and adaptive algorithms. Participants provide open-ended responses that are converted into structured survey questions using large language models. These questions are added to an evolving question bank. An adaptive algorithm (multi-armed bandit) determines which questions to prioritize based on participant ratings, focusing on the best performing questions.

Key Steps:
1) Gather open-ended responses from participants
2) Convert responses into structured questions using LLMs 
3) Apply toxicity and redundancy filters 
4) Participants rate their own and other questions 
5) Update question bank priorities using adaptive algorithm

Contributions:
- Demonstrates CSAS ability to uncover emerging issues and information missed by traditional surveys
- Crowdsources questions directly from participants making instruments more democratic  
- Adaptive design allows exploring a broader set of questions while minimizing survey length
- Method is flexible - can be paired with fixed batteries or used across survey waves
- Provides template to facilitate implementation of CSAS methodology

Overall, the CSAS methodology introduces an adaptive and customizable survey approach that evolves based on participant contributions and has applications for tracking opinion dynamics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a crowdsourced adaptive survey methodology that uses natural language processing and multi-armed bandit algorithms to generate evolving question banks from open-ended user input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new survey methodology called the Crowdsourced Adaptive Survey (CSAS) method. The key ideas behind CSAS are:

- It uses open-ended responses from participants to generate structured survey questions that are added to an evolving question bank. This allows the survey to adapt in real-time to uncover emerging issues or beliefs.

- It leverages large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to convert open-ended text into structured questions. LLMs can summarize responses into concise questions.

- It implements a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select the best-performing questions from the question bank to present to participants. This balances exploring new questions while focusing on the most useful ones.

- It is applied to two cases - gauging Latino beliefs about political misinformation and measuring issue importance. The method is able to uncover niche issues and claims that would likely be missed by traditional survey approaches with fixed questions.

So in summary, the main contribution is a new dynamic survey methodology that uses participant input and adaptive algorithms to generate an evolving set of survey questions in real-time. This allows surveys to better capture emerging trends in public opinion.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the crowdsourced adaptive survey (CSAS) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using Gaussian Thompson sampling to select questions from the item bank. Can you explain in more detail how this algorithm works and why it was chosen over other adaptive algorithms like upper confidence bound (UCB)? 

2. When converting open-ended responses to structured questions using large language models (LLMs), what steps did you take to fine-tune the models and ensure high-quality output? Were certain models better suited for this task than others?

3. For the study on Latino information environments, what criteria did you use to determine whether a claim was considered "highly-rated"? Could you share more details on the threshold used and how it was selected?

4. In the issue importance study, you found some divergence between the Gallup "most important issues" and the top issues uncovered using CSAS. To what extent do you think this reflects limitations in the Gallup approach versus real differences in issue salience across groups?

5. You mention guardrails like toxicity filters and redundancy checks that can be implemented with CSAS. In testing these, did you encounter any false positives or false negatives, where acceptable questions were blocked or inappropriate ones allowed through? How might researchers balance quality control while still capturing a diversity of views?  

6. For researchers new to working with APIs and databases, what advice would you have for implementing the CSAS architecture on a practical level? Are there shortcuts that avoid the need to set up one's own database and server?

7. You used both proprietary models like GPT-3 and open-source alternatives like Mixtral for processing text. In which CSAS applications might open-source models still fall short, and how rapidly are their capabilities advancing?

8. How sensitive are the results from CSAS studies to the specific prompt wording and instructions given to participants for open-ended questions? What best practices did you follow when developing effective prompts?

9. In comparing subgroups in the studies, you focus on factors like WhatsApp usage and partisanship. Along which other dimensions might it be useful to analyze heterogeneity in future CSAS studies?  

10. If you were to select one additional area of research to apply CSAS to next, which would it be and why? What aspects of public opinion could especially benefit from adaptive, participant-guided surveys?
