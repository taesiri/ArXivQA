# [Supporting Mitosis Detection AI Training with Inter-Observer Eye-Gaze   Consistencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01656)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Developing AI systems for pathology image analysis is challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality labeled data from pathologists. Manual annotation is time-consuming and availability of pathologists is limited.  
- Using eye-tracking to collect doctors' gaze data as labels for training AI systems has shown promise, but pathology images tend to have higher noise and variability compared to radiology images. Also, pathology tasks like object detection require localization, unlike classification tasks.
- Prior work has limitations - requiring doctors to explicitly fixate to provide labels disrupts workflow; also directly using raw gaze data suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio.

Proposed Solution:
- Collect eye-gaze data from 14 non-medical participants viewing 800 pathology images of meningioma brain tumors, with and without mitoses. 
- Generate labels from inter-observer consistent eye-gaze fixations instead of raw gaze data to reduce noise.
- Assess quality of labels generated from varying groups of 3-14 participants. Include more participants to get better precision and recall.   
- Use these eye-gaze labels to train CNNs for mitosis detection. Compare performance against CNNs trained on heuristic baseline and ground truth labels from pathologists.

Main Contributions:
- Introduced a pipeline to create labels from consistent inter-observer eye-gaze fixations on pathology images, without disrupting routine interpretation workflow.
- Demonstrated the efficacy of these eye-gaze labels for training CNNs for mitosis detection, significantly outperforming heuristic baselines. Performance approached those trained on ground truth labels.
- Established the utility of leveraging inter-observer gaze consistencies to extract meaningful signals from low SNR eye-tracking data for medical imaging AI.
- Presented a case study focused on mitosis detection, but the methodology can be generalized to other pathology tasks involving object detection.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards overcoming the bottlenecks in acquiring labels for developing AI systems in digital pathology, with a novel approach using eye-gaze data. The consistency-based label generation method manages to extract meaningful training signals despite gaze data noise.
