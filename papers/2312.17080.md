# [Challenge LLMs to Reason About Reasoning: A Benchmark to Unveil   Cognitive Depth in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17080)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing math problem benchmarks like GSM8K focus only on final answer accuracy and overlook the reasoning process. This allows models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the underlying concepts.
- Benchmarks also lack ability to differentiate reasoning abilities between models. Models can have similar benchmark scores but differ greatly in actual reasoning capabilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a new "reason about reasoning" evaluation paradigm that challenges models to assess the correctness of different reasoning paths to solve a problem. 
- Developed a new benchmark called DiagGSM8K based on this paradigm, where models must determine solution correctness, identify the first error step in incorrect solutions, and explain the error reason.

Key Findings:
- State-of-the-art models like GPT-4, Claude, GPT-3 struggle significantly on DiagGSM8K, with accuracy as low as 4.3% in identifying error reasons. This reveals deficiencies in their reasoning abilities.
- Performance varies greatly between models on DiagGSM8K despite similar scores on GSM8K. Shows it can effectively differentiate model capabilities.
- Targeted fine-tuning helps improve performance on DiagGSM8K but doesn't enhance conceptual mastery. Models still lack genuine understanding. 

Main Contributions:
1) Introduces new "reason about reasoning" evaluation principle and DiagGSM8K benchmark to assess model's capability for meta-reasoning.
2) Analysis shows current models and training methodologies have critical deficiencies in reasoning capabilities. Advocates changes in training paradigms.  
3) Demonstrates new paradigm and benchmark can effectively differentiate model abilities unlike traditional benchmarks.

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the proposed benchmark and evaluation framework introduced to tackle this issue, the experiment results and analysis, and highlights the main contributions made in this research.
