# [IndicLLMSuite: A Blueprint for Creating Pre-training and Fine-Tuning   Datasets for Indian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06350)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- There is a lack of open-source datasets and models for Indian languages compared to English, hindering progress in building large language models (LLMs).  
- There are no standardized pipelines to aggregate data from diverse sources like websites, books, videos for Indian languages.
- There is limited Indian-grounded instruction fine-tuning data to adapt LLMs for Indian-centric tasks.

Proposed Solution - IndicLLMSuite
- Sangraha (251B tokens) - Pretraining data spanning 22 Indian languages collected from verified websites, books, videos etc. using a custom pipeline. Combines human-verified, unverified and synthetic data.
- Setu - A spark-based pipeline for cleaning, filtering and deduplicating the Sangraha data from diverse sources. Also includes translation and transliteration pipelines.
- IndicAlign (74.8M pairs) - Diverse prompt-response pairs for instruction fine-tuning, created by aggregating existing datasets, translating English datasets into 14 Indian languages, using LLMs like LLaMA to create grounded conversations from Indian wikipedia/wikihow articles and getting human inputs.
- IndicAlign-Toxic (123K pairs) - Toxic prompt and refusal response pairs in 14 languages to teach models to refrain from responding to inappropriate inputs.

Main Contributions
- First standardized dataset and pipeline covering 22 Indian languages tailored for pretraining and fine-tuning LLMs
- Combines human-verified, unverified and synthetic data to balance quality and scale
- Open-sources all data, tools and models to drive Indic LLM research and development  

The work aims to catalyze progress in Indic language LLM development through community collaboration. The resources are released under permissive licenses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces IndicLLMSuite, a comprehensive framework for developing Indic language large language models, comprising Sangraha (251B tokens for pre-training), Setu (pipeline for data cleaning/filtering), IndicAlign-Instruct (74.8M prompt-response pairs for instruction tuning), and IndicAlign-Toxic (123K toxic prompts with non-toxic responses for safety alignment).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Sangraha: A large multilingual pre-training corpus containing 251 billion tokens covering 22 Indian languages, comprising verified data from websites, PDFs and videos (64 billion tokens), unverified but filtered web data (24 billion tokens), and synthesized/translated data from English Wikipedia and other sources (162 billion tokens).

2. Setu: A Spark-based pipeline for cleaning, filtering, deduplicating and synthesizing large multilingual datasets through translation and transliteration while preserving document structure.

3. IndicAlign: A collection of over 74 million prompt-response pairs for instruction tuning, created by aggregating existing datasets, translating English datasets, generating grounded conversations from Indian Wikipedia, and collecting new prompts.

4. IndicAlign-Toxic: 123K prompt-response pairs for safety alignment in Indian languages, generated by classifying toxic prompts and then producing refusal responses.

So in summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive suite of datasets, tools and frameworks focused specifically on developing resources for pre-training and fine-tuning large language models for Indian languages. The goal is to advance Indic NLP and establish a blueprint for extending such efforts to other languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- IndicLLMSuite - The overarching framework introduced in this paper encompassing datasets, pipelines, and other resources for developing Indic language models.

- Sangraha - The pre-training dataset comprising over 250 billion tokens across 22 Indic languages, with splits for verified, unverified, and synthetic data.

- Setu - The data cleaning and processing pipeline for crawling, extracting, filtering, and deduplicating multilingual data.

- IndicAlign - The prompt-response collection for instruction tuning of Indic models, containing both instruct and toxic alignment datasets.  

- Anudesh - The crowdsourcing platform created for collecting grounded, conversational data between users and assistant models.

- Model-generated data - Referring to the use of existing models like LLaMa to produce synthetic datasets, both for pre-training and instruction tuning.

Other key ideas include translation, transliteration, OCR of books/PDFs, speech data sources, bounding box suppression for PDF layout parsing, perplexity-based filtering, word embeddings for deduplication, and balancing quality with scale in data collection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a comprehensive framework called IndicLLMSuite for building pre-training and fine-tuning datasets for Indian languages. Can you elaborate on the key components of this framework and how they aim to address current limitations in Indic language model development?

2. The paper takes a balanced approach of using human-verified, unverified, and synthetic data for the Sangraha pre-training corpus. What are some of the trade-offs between focusing solely on quality versus quantity that influenced this design choice? 

3. Sangraha Verified seems to place an emphasis on sourcing data from diverse modalities like websites, books, and speech. What are some of the challenges introduced by aggregating multi-modal data at scale and how does the proposed Setu pipeline aim to address them?

4. The paper highlights issues with relying solely on a single LID model for language identification. Can you explain the ensemble approach proposed and why it might be better suited for Indic languages compared to existing solutions?

5. The IndoWordNet fine-tuning dataset is an interesting idea to teach models grammar and language creativity. What are some ways this structured lexical resource could be leveraged for other downstream tasks as well?

6. The paper takes a unique approach of using a taxonomy to synthetically generate toxic alignment data. Do you think this methodology can generalize well or could it potentially suffer from coverage issues?

7. What are some of the ethical considerations regarding consent and data privacy that need to be addressed when aggregating data from sources like Common Crawl and crowdsourcing? 

8. Human evaluation of model outputs on the proposed fine-tuning datasets could reveal useful insights. What aspects of language quality and conversational ability should such evaluations focus on?

9. The paper calls for collaborative LLM training by pooling community resources. What are some ways this can be coordinated and what precedents already exist for such large-scale distributed efforts?

10. The proposed framework has highlighted some geographical and demographic disparities in the curated data. How can the data collection process be refined to make it more inclusive and representative of minority groups?
