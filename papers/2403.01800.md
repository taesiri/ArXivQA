# [AtomoVideo: High Fidelity Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to generate a vivid video from a single reference image while maintaining fidelity to the image details. This is challenging as it requires balancing motion coherence against preserving fine-grained image details.

Method: 
- Proposes AtomoVideo, a framework for high-fidelity I2V generation. It is based on a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model with additional temporal layers that are trained.
- Injects image information at input via concatenated image feature channels to preserve low-level details. Also attends to an encoded image representation to capture high-level semantics.   
- Employs training strategies like zero terminal SNR and v-prediction that improve video stability without relying on a noisy prior.
- Flexibly extends to video prediction by iteratively predicting future frames given preceding frames. Enables generating longer videos.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on multiple metrics like temporal consistency, image fidelity, motion intensity. Qualitative results also showcase more coherent motion without compromising on image detail preservation.
- Framework is compatible with personalised text-to-image models by only retraining the temporal components. Allows for easy integration with existing model ecosystems.
- Does not require a prior noise distribution seeded with image information. Generates videos directly from Gaussian noise to enable greater motion freedom.

In summary, the paper introduces AtomoVideo, a novel high-fidelity I2V generation framework that pushes the state-of-the-art on multiple fronts while also providing flexibility for integration with personalised models.
