# [SH2: Self-Highlighted Hesitation Helps You Decode More Truthfully](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA demonstrate great performance in text generation, but still suffer from hallucinations, generating non-factual and incorrect information.
- Existing methods try to address this either through retrieval augmentation (using external knowledge bases) or decoding reformulation (rescaling probabilities). However, they have limitations in relying on additional data/models or not fully eliciting the knowledge inside the LLM itself. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2), an inference-time method to help LLMs decode more truthfully using only the LLM itself.
- It selects the hardest, lowest probability tokens from the input as "key tokens", which likely carry factual information. 
- These key tokens are highlighted and concatenated to the input to construct "hesitations", forcing the LLM to repeatedly read them and hesitate before generation.
- Contrastive decoding is used to emphasize the probability difference brought by the hesitation.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates the relation between lower probability tokens and factual information through POS tag analysis.
- Introduces the concepts of key tokens, hesitations and contrastive decoding over hesitations.
- Achieves significant improvements over baselines on multiple hallucination benchmarks and metrics using only the LLM itself, no external data/models.
- Shows the ability of SH2 to elicit factual knowledge inside LLMs and guide them to generate more truthfully.
- Proposes a new paradigm leveraging model uncertainty to make LLMs more truthful.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective inference-time method called SH2 to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs by highlighting uncertain key tokens and decoding over hesitations. It demonstrates strong performance improvements using only the LLM's own knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2) that helps large language models decode more truthfully by selecting key tokens that are hardest to predict, hesitating on them to focus the model's attention, and contrasting the difference in output probabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel inference-time method called Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2) to help large language models (LLMs) decode more truthfully. Specifically:

- SH2 selects key tokens from the input text that have lower prediction probabilities, as these tokens tend to be more informative and factual. 

- It constructs "hesitations" by highlighting these key tokens and forcing the model to repeatedly read them before generation. This gives the model more time to comprehend the factual information.

- It also adopts contrastive decoding during generation to emphasize the difference in output probabilities with and without the hesitations. 

- Experiments show that SH2 can effectively elicit factual knowledge inside LLMs and help mitigate their hallucination issues, without needing any additional data or models. It achieves significant improvements on multiple hallucination benchmark tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is using the prediction probabilities of the LLM itself to highlight informative tokens, create hesitations focused on those tokens, and guide the model's decoding process - all towards generating more truthful and factual responses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2): The proposed method to help language models decode more truthfully by highlighting informative tokens that are hard to predict and forcing the model to hesitate on them.

- Key tokens: Tokens that are assigned lower probabilities by the language model and are more likely to be informative and factual. The paper analyzes the relation between low probability tokens and factual information.

- Hesitations: Constructed text consisting of the key tokens that models are prompted with to focus more on factual information before generating text. 

- Contrastive decoding: Reformulating the output probability distribution using the difference in model confidence on text with and without the hesitations. 

- Hallucinations: Non-factual information generated by language models. The paper evaluates methods on multiple "hallucination tasks/benchmarks" designed to measure truthfulness.

- Truthfulness: The focus of the paper is helping language models decode more truthfully and elicit factual knowledge to reduce hallucinations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the SH2 method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the relation between key tokens and factual information provide intuition for using key tokens to reduce hallucination? Explain the analysis done in Section 3.2.

2. The paper proposes highlighting key tokens by selecting those with the lowest prediction probabilities. Discuss alternative strategies for selecting which tokens to highlight and why selecting low probability tokens is most effective.  

3. Explain the motivation behind introducing the hesitation text constructed from key tokens. How does this provide more opportunities for the model to focus on factual information?

4. Contrastive decoding is used to incorporate the difference in confidence brought by the hesitation text. Explain why directly using the hesitation text as a prompt may not be enough to reduce hallucination. 

5. Analyze the effect of different values of the hyperparameter α used in contrastive decoding. How does α allow trading off the base probability versus the confidence difference?

6. The analysis studies three different choices for which tokens are highlighted - key, easy, random. Compare the performance of models using these different highlighting approaches. Why does highlighting key tokens work best?

7. The paper experiments with different manners for the hesitation text - repetition, pausing, key tokens. Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in improving truthfulness. 

8. How does the number of key tokens highlighted impact performance when using contrastive decoding? Explain why very few key tokens can still provide significant gains.

9. Discuss the bias observed in the HaluEval summarization dataset between performance on hallucinated and factual summaries. How does the SH2 method help mitigate this imbalance?

10. The SH2 method requires no additional data or models. Analyze the tradeoffs versus approaches like retrieval augmentation that incorporate external knowledge bases. When might each approach be more viable?
