# [ChartInstruct: Instruction Tuning for Chart Comprehension and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09028)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Charts are widely used for data analysis and conveying insights, but understanding and answering queries about charts poses challenges. 
- Existing chart-related downstream tasks like question answering and summarization typically fine-tune models originally trained on vision and language tasks. However, such models may not be optimal for chart tasks as they don't explicitly model chart structures and relationships. 
- Recent chart-specific models are limited to certain chart sources/styles and narrow tasks, constraining real-world applicability.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce ChartInstruct - a new chart instruction-following dataset with 191K instructions for 71K real-world charts from 157 online sources covering diverse styles.
- Leverage advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to generate instructions for a wide array of tasks including summarization, QA, fact checking, reasoning, and even novel LLM-proposed tasks.
- Present two systems: 
   1) End-to-end model connecting UniChart vision encoder with LLM decoder
   2) Pipeline extracting data table from chart and inputting into LLM
- Finetune systems on ChartInstruct dataset to enhance alignment with user intent across tasks.

Main Contributions:
- ChartInstruct dataset with broad coverage of chart tasks and styles
- Two specialized systems incorporating chart-specific encoders tailored for instruction tuning
- State-of-the-art performance across 4 downstream benchmarks
- Human evaluation shows enhanced adherence to instructions and ability to address new real-world chart analysis scenarios beyond existing benchmarks

The paper introduces ChartInstruct, a new chart instruction-following dataset and specialized tuning methodology to enhance chart comprehension and reasoning abilities across a diverse range of real-world applications.
