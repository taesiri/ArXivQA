# [RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Existing retrieval augmented language models retrieve only short, contiguous passages of text as context during inference. This limits their understanding of broader discourse structure and thematic comprehension required for complex question answering.  

Proposed Solution - RAPTOR
- Introduces a novel tree-based retrieval system that recursively clusters, summarizes, and embeds chunks of texts to construct a multi-layered tree structure. This captures both high-level themes and granular details.
- During inference, traverses this tree structure to retrieve relevant nodes at different levels of abstraction as context for the language model.
- Employs two querying mechanisms - tree traversal and collapsed tree search to retrieve relevant nodes.

Key Outcomes
- Controlled experiments across 3 datasets (NarrativeQA, QuALITY, QASPER) and 3 language models (GPT-3, GPT-4, UnifiedQA) show RAPTOR outperforms current retrieval techniques like BM25 and DPR.
- Further experiments demonstrate new SOTA results when pairing RAPTOR with GPT-4 and sometimes even UnifiedQA on the 3 QA datasets. For e.g. 20% absolute accuracy gains on QuALITY benchmark.
- Ablation studies validate the utility of the multi-layered tree structure in handling diverse queries ranging from specific details to high-level themes.

Main Contributions
- Novel idea of recursive text summarization for encoding documents at multiple levels of abstraction to allow retrieval augmentation at different scales.
- Empirically demonstrates improved performance across several QA datasets, with new SOTA results on a few.
- Highlights the importance of modeling discourse structure for complex reasoning.

In summary, RAPTOR is an effective retrieval augmentation technique that provides contextual information at varying levels of abstraction to aid language model performance on complex QA tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces RAPTOR, a novel tree-based retrieval system that recursively clusters, summarizes, and embeds chunks of text to construct a multi-layered tree capturing information at different levels of abstraction. Experiments demonstrate that retrieval augmentation with RAPTOR's hierarchical structure significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on several QA datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The idea of using text summarization to allow retrieval augmentation of context at different scales, and demonstrating its effectiveness in experiments on collections of long documents.

Specifically, the paper introduces RAPTOR, a novel tree-based retrieval system that recursively clusters and summarizes chunks of text to construct a tree capturing details at different levels of abstraction. This structure enables retrieving information across lengthy documents at different granularities. Controlled experiments show that retrieval with RAPTOR's recursive summaries significantly improves performance over traditional retrieval methods on several question answering tasks.

The paper introduces a new model called RAPTOR that utilizes recursive summarization to build a tree structure indexing lengthy texts. This allows retrieval of information at different scales to improve language model performance on complex question answering tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning. The key ideas focus on text summarization, tree-based retrieval, recursively generating text summaries, and evaluating on challenging QA datasets. The proposed RAPTOR model with retrieval augmentation is shown to achieve new state-of-the-art results on several datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the RAPTOR method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the recursive clustering and summarization process allow RAPTOR to capture information at different levels of abstraction in the text? What are the trade-offs with simply retrieving raw passages of text?

2. The paper argues that RAPTOR scales linearly in terms of computation time and tokens used. Can you explain how the tree construction process contributes to this scalability? What are limitations on the size of corpora it could handle?  

3. What motivated the design choice of using soft clustering for grouping text chunks in RAPTOR? How does allowing membership in multiple clusters help capture interrelated information across the text?

4. How exactly does the querying process differ between the tree traversal and collapsed tree methods? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each?

5. Why does RAPTOR couple summarization with the language models instead of doing summarization separately beforehand? What impact would decoupling these have on performance?

6. The paper finds minimal hallucination from the summarization model. However, how might the type of dataset impact risks of hallucination propagation in RAPTOR? 

7. What specifically about the multi-layer tree structure makes RAPTOR better suited than traditional methods for answering thematic, multi-hop questions? Can you give examples?

8. How do choices in clustering hyperparameters like number of neighbors in UMAP impact the breadth versus depth of relationships captured in the tree structure?

9. The results show RAPTOR helps various LMs. What differences between LMs change the relative benefits of RAPTOR's retrieval? Why does it help even huge LMs?

10. What types of corpora or applications do you think would NOT be suitable for RAPTOR? Can you adapt the technique for other use cases like open-web browsing?
