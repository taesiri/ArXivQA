# [MM-REACT: Prompting ChatGPT for Multimodal Reasoning and Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11381)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems the central hypothesis of this paper is that integrating large language models like ChatGPT with existing specialized vision models through proper prompting and textualization can achieve advanced visual intelligence capabilities, without requiring expensive joint fine-tuning like in some recent vision-language models. 

The key ideas appear to be:

- Leveraging ChatGPT's strong instructional capabilities to teach it how to invoke different vision experts through textual prompts.

- Converting visual inputs like images/videos into textual placeholders (file paths) that ChatGPT can reason about. 

- Serializing the outputs of vision models into text that ChatGPT can further process.

- Demonstrating that with the right prompt design and vision expert integration, this approach can enable ChatGPT to perform well on a variety of complex visual understanding tasks that normally require expensive joint training of vision and language models.

So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that prompting and composing existing models is an effective alternative to joint finetuning for multimodal reasoning and understanding. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis across different task settings.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding, the key point of the paper is that it proposes MM-ReAct, a system that combines ChatGPT with specialized vision models/experts through prompts and text interfaces to achieve enhanced multimodal reasoning and visual understanding capabilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work:

- The key distinction from prior vision+language models is that this paper proposes composing existing vision experts with LLMs in a flexible way, rather than joint finetuning a unified model. This allows utilizing the strengths of specialized vision models.

- It builds off recent NLP methods like ReAct that combine reasoning and action abilities of LLMs, and extends this paradigm to the multimodal domain. The core ideas are prompting ChatGPT to break down problems via reasoning text and invoke vision experts as executable actions through watchwords. 

- In comparison to concurrent works Visual ChatGPT and ViperGPT:

1) Visual ChatGPT focuses more on image generation/editing, while this work focuses on visual understanding. 

2) ViperGPT uses LLMs to generate Python code in a one-round query, while this is a multi-round dialogue system that can flexibly combine multiple vision experts.

Overall, the key novelties seem to be:

- Extending the reasoning + action paradigm from NLP to multimodal scenarios 
- Flexible integration of existing vision models without joint finetuning 
- Multi-round dialogue interface powered by reasoning and tool invocation

The proposed MM-ReAct system demonstrates intriguing capabilities for advanced visual understanding tasks through this framework. The design provides flexibility for upgrading modules and utilizing specialized vision experts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the authors do not explicitly suggest specific future research directions. The paper introduces a system called MM-ReAct that combines ChatGPT with computer vision experts to achieve multimodal reasoning and action. The key contributions seem to be:

1) Defining and exploring advanced vision tasks that may exceed capabilities of existing vision and vision-language models. 

2) Introducing a prompt design to represent text, spatial coordinates, and file names to process multimodal inputs with ChatGPT.

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of MM-ReAct in solving visual understanding tasks through zero-shot experiments.

4) Comparing the system paradigm to an alternative approach of extending language models for multimodality through joint finetuning.

While no explicit future work is mentioned, the limitations acknowledged by the authors suggest some potential research directions:

- Developing benchmarks to systematically evaluate performance on visual understanding in the wild.

- Expanding and improving the integrated vision experts to enhance capabilities.

- Exploring optimal representations beyond converting visual signals to text.

- Automating the prompt engineering process.

Overall, the paper seems to introduce a promising approach and system, but does not strongly point to specific future work. The limitations provide some clues, but the authors do not directly suggest research directions to pursue.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MM-ReAct, a system that integrates ChatGPT with a pool of vision experts to achieve multimodal reasoning and action for advanced visual intelligence tasks. MM-ReAct introduces a textual prompt design to represent images/videos via file paths so ChatGPT can accept and process multimodal inputs. The prompts also instruct ChatGPT to generate "action requests" with watchwords (e.g. "Assistant") to invoke different vision experts as needed. The experts' outputs are serialized as text observations for ChatGPT to assimilate. Through this prompted synergy of ChatGPT and vision experts, MM-ReAct demonstrates capabilities in multi-image reasoning, open-world concept understanding, video summarization, and other complex visual tasks. The system follows a flexible paradigm allowing upgrades like using GPT-4 instead of ChatGPT. Experiments show MM-ReAct achieving strong results without expensive joint training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MM-ReAct, a system that integrates ChatGPT with a pool of vision experts to achieve multimodal reasoning and action. MM-ReAct introduces a textual prompt design that can represent text descriptions, spatial coordinates, and file names to process images and videos. This allows language models like ChatGPT to accept and process multimodal information by seeking help from specialized vision experts. The system's flowchart shows how user input, ChatGPT responses, vision expert execution, and observations are combined in a loop to gather information and generate final responses. Through instructional prompting, ChatGPT learns when and how to invoke different vision experts based on the user's query. Experiments demonstrate MM-ReAct's effectiveness in addressing advanced visual understanding tasks like multi-image reasoning, open-world concept understanding, and video summarization without additional multimodal training.

The key advantage of MM-ReAct is the flexibility to upgrade modules and incorporate specialized experts compared to end-to-end vision-language models. Limitations include reliance on external experts, converting visuals to text, and manual prompt engineering. Overall, the paper presents an intriguing prompting-based approach to achieve multimodal reasoning and action for advanced visual intelligence. MM-ReAct demonstrates promising zero-shot capabilities on a range of understanding tasks by synergizing ChatGPT's reasoning with existing vision experts.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes \modelname, a system that integrates ChatGPT with a pool of vision experts to achieve multimodal reasoning and action for advanced visual intelligence tasks. \modelname uses file path strings as placeholders for images and videos as input to ChatGPT. It prompts ChatGPT with instructions and examples on how to invoke different vision experts by generating specialized "action request" texts. Based on the user's query, ChatGPT is expected to reason about which experts are needed, generate action requests to call them, serialize their outputs as text observations, and incorporate the observations to produce a final response. This allows composing multiple vision modules in a flexible way without joint finetuning. The key ideas are prompting ChatGPT to plan actions for calling modular vision experts, converting visual signals to text for ChatGPT's consumption, and chaining ChatGPT inferences and vision expert executions in a dialogue flow.
