# [Uplifting the Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks through Graph   Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08671)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel graph neural network architecture called Graph Partitioning Neural Networks (GPNN) that enhances expressivity and representation power by capturing intricate structural interactions revealed through graph partitioning. The key idea is to leverage permutation-invariant graph partitioning schemes to separate a graph into structural components with different properties. Interactions within and between these components, characterized as partition isomorphism and interaction isomorphism respectively, are then encoded into graph representations. Theoretical analysis shows that by considering different types of interactions, GPNN variants can achieve varying levels of expressive power, from 1-WL to 3-WL. Empirically, GPNN demonstrates superior performance over strong baselines on tasks including graph classification, graph regression and vertex classification. The ablation studies also verify that with an appropriate partitioning scheme, GPNN can effectively learn useful structural interactions. Overall, this work provides new theoretical insights and practical solutions connecting graph partitioning and graph neural networks for more powerful graph representation learning.
