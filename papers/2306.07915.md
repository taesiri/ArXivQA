# [Image Captioners Are Scalable Vision Learners Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07915)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How does image captioning as a pretraining task compare to contrastive image-text pretraining for learning general vision representations, when carefully controlling for training data, compute, and model capacity?

The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:

1) Image captioning alone can produce competitive vision representations compared to contrastive pretraining, despite prior work showing contrastive pretraining to be superior. 

2) Image captioning exhibits favorable scaling behavior as model size and data scale increase, being competitive or surpassing contrastive pretraining.

3) Models pretrained with captioning are better suited for some downstream vision-language tasks like VQA compared to contrastively pretrained models.

So in summary, the main research question is re-evaluating image captioning as a pretraining strategy compared to contrastive pretraining under controlled setups, testing if conclusions from prior work still hold. The key hypotheses are that captioning can be competitive or better, especially as scale increases, and is well-suited for certain downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:

- Performing a systematic comparison between image captioning and contrastive learning for pre-training vision representations, carefully matching factors like model capacity, compute, and training data. 

- Showing that a simple encoder-decoder Transformer trained on image captioning can produce vision encoders competitive with or even superior to contrastively trained ones like CLIP when transferred to various downstream vision and vision-language tasks.

- Introducing a mixed captioning training procedure called CapPa that interleaves standard auto-regressive prediction with parallel prediction of the full caption. This further improves the quality of the vision encoder compared to standard captioning.

- Analyzing the effect of model capacity, training data size, encoder architecture etc. on the relative performance of contrastive and captioning-based pre-training.

- Demonstrating that captioning-based encoders have favorable properties for fine-grained classification, combining well with frozen language models, and handling detailed image descriptions.

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be showing that image captioning alone, when implemented properly, can be a surprisingly effective pre-training task for learning general visual representations, despite some previous beliefs. The paper provides extensive experimental evidence across various model settings and tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper presents an empirical comparison of image captioning and contrastive vision-text pretraining strategies for learning general visual representations, finding that captioning alone can produce competitive vision encoders.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of vision-language pretraining:

- It revisits image captioning as a pretraining task, which had fallen out of favor compared to contrastive approaches like CLIP. Recent work has tended to augment captioning with contrastive losses rather than use it alone. So this explores captioning in a purer form.

- It systematically compares caption pretraining to contrastive pretraining while controlling for model capacity, compute, and data. This is a fairer comparison than prior work like the original CLIP paper. 

- It shows that at similar scale, caption pretraining can produce visual encoders competitive with contrastive approaches, especially for vision-and-language tasks. This challenges the notion that captioning is inferior for pretraining encoders.

- It proposes a simple mixed training procedure (CapPa) that improves results without modifications to the architecture or training cost. This demonstrates caption pretraining still has room for improvement.

- It analyzes the effect of scale and shows captioning exhibits similar or better scaling compared to contrastive pretraining. This suggests the gap may further narrow or reverse with greater scale.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarking word ordering and object relationships, unlike contrastive models that behave more like bag-of-words models.

Overall, this work provides one of the most extensive recent analyses on caption pretraining, challenging established notions about its limitations. The comparable results to contrastive pretraining are surprising and open promising research directions. The scaling results and analyses are also novel contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further exploring image captioning as a pretraining task at larger model and data scales. The authors found captioning models exhibit good scaling behavior, and suggest pushing this further.

- Improving the inference efficiency of captioning models for tasks like zero-shot classification where they currently lag behind contrastive models. The authors suggest exploring parallel prediction during inference as one possible approach. 

- Combining the benefits of contrastive and captioning pretraining objectives in a single model. The authors note each has complementary strengths.

- Using captioning pretraining for multimodal models that combine vision and language components. The authors show benefits on vision-language transfer tasks.

- Studying what linguistic properties are learned by captioning models versus contrastive ones, e.g. using benchmarks like ARO that test for fine-grained language understanding.

- Exploring variations of the captioning model architecture and training objectives to further improve the vision representations learned.

In summary, the main directions are around better understanding and improving captioning-based pretraining, and combining it with contrastive pretraining to get the best of both worlds. Scaling up and applying these models to multimodal tasks are also highlighted.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an extensive comparison of vision encoders pretrained with a contrastive objective (CLIP-style models) versus a generative image captioning objective (encoder-decoder transformer models). Carefully matching training compute, model capacity, and data between contrastive and generative pretraining, the authors find that the generative approach produces competitive vision backbones. While contrastive models excel at zero-shot classification, captioning-based encoders achieve better performance when transferred to vision-language tasks like captioning and VQA, and exhibit favorable scaling behavior. Overall, the results indicate that plain image captioning should be considered a strong alternative to contrastive pretraining for learning general vision representations from web-scale image-text data. The authors propose techniques like parallel prediction during training to improve captioning-based pretraining, and highlight strengths like implicitly capturing word order and object relationships.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using a simple encoder-decoder transformer architecture for image captioning as an effective way to pretrain vision encoders on large datasets of image-text pairs collected from the web. The authors compare this approach, referred to as Captioner (Cap), to contrastive image-text pretraining like CLIP. While prior work found captioning inferior for pretraining vision encoders, the authors show that with careful matching of model capacity, compute, and data, Cap can rival CLIP for training general purpose vision backbones. Specifically, Cap matches or exceeds CLIP models of comparable size and compute on few-shot classification, vision-language transfer tasks, and scaling behavior. The authors also propose CapPa, a variant of Cap that mixes standard next-token prediction with parallel prediction of the full caption. CapPa further improves over Cap and narrows the gap to CLIP. Overall, the work shows that image captioning alone can produce high-quality vision representations, challenging the notion that it is an inferior pretraining task compared to contrastive learning. The results indicate captioning might be preferred when later combining the vision backbone with a pretrained language model.

In summary, this paper revisits image captioning as a pretraining strategy, finding it to be competitive with contrastive learning for producing general-purpose vision backbones when carefully controlling for model capacity, compute, and data. The proposed Captioner models are simple to implement and exhibit promising scaling behavior. CapPa mixes standard next-token prediction with predicting the full caption in parallel during training to further close the gap to contrastive models like CLIP. The results show captioning should not be overlooked as an effective self-supervised pretraining approach, especially when targeting transfer to vision-language tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using a standard encoder-decoder transformer architecture for image captioning as a way to pretrain a visual backbone on large amounts of image-text data. The encoder is a Vision Transformer (ViT) which encodes an image into a sequence of embeddings. This sequence is fed via cross-attention into a Transformer decoder to predict an image caption in an autoregressive manner. The authors also propose a mixed training approach where the model alternates between standard next-token prediction and parallel prediction of the full caption. The pretrained vision encoder can then be used for transfer learning, combined with a text module like in recent multimodal models. Compared to contrastive image-text pretraining like CLIP, this captioning approach is shown to be competitive or better for several computer vision tasks, while also exhibiting good scaling properties. The simplicity of finetuning a standard transformer architecture on image-caption data is highlighted as a benefit over contrastive methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It revisits image captioning as a pretraining task for learning general vision encoders from web image-text pairs, in contrast to the popularity of contrastive learning approaches like CLIP. 

- It compares models pretrained with captioning (termed Captioner or Cap) versus contrastive learning (termed CLIP) carefully matching training data, compute, and model capacity.

- It finds that captioning alone can produce competitive vision encoders to contrastive pretraining, especially for downstream vision & language tasks like captioning and VQA. Captioning models are better at capturing word order and relationships compared to contrastive models.

- Overall, it shows captioning is a competitive pretraining approach for visual encoders, especially for multimodal models, challenging the view that it is inferior to contrastive learning.

In summary, the key question addressed is whether image captioning alone can be an effective pretraining strategy compared to contrastive learning, when carefully controlled for model capacity, compute, and data. The results show captioning is surprisingly effective for a range of downstream vision and vision-language tasks.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper revisits image captioning as a pretraining task for learning general vision encoders from web image-text pairs. The authors compare Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders pretrained via image captioning (Captioner or Gen) to those pretrained via contrastive learning (CLIP) on a variety of downstream tasks. They carefully match training data, compute, and model capacity between the two approaches. Surprisingly, they find that the generatively pretrained encoders are competitive and sometimes better than contrastively pretrained ones on classification, especially few-shot classification and fine-grained tasks. The captioning-based encoders also match or exceed contrastive encoders on vision-language tasks like captioning and VQA when combined with a decoder. Further analysis reveals favorable scaling properties of captioners along axes of model capacity, data scale, and compute. The authors propose a CapPa training procedure that alternates between autoregressive and parallel prediction during captioning, which boosts encoder transferrability.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper revisits image captioning as a pretraining task for learning general visual representations, comparing it to contrastive vision-language pretraining approaches like CLIP. The authors train a standard transformer encoder-decoder model on 1B Web image-alt text pairs to predict captions. They introduce a mixed training approach combining autoregressive and parallel prediction, termed CapPa. When combined with various decoders, the resulting vision encoders are surprisingly competitive or even exceed CLIP encoders for few-shot classification, captioning, VQA and other vision-language tasks, while lagging behind in zero-shot classification. Analyzing model architecture and scale dependencies shows that captioners exhibit similar or better scaling compared to contrastive models. Overall, the results indicate captioning alone can produce high-quality vision backbones, presenting an interesting alternative to contrastive pretraining for multimodal models. The pretrained text decoder is less useful, but text encoders matched to the vision representation can be learned cheaply.
