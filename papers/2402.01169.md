# [Faster Inference of Integer SWIN Transformer by Removing the GELU   Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- SWIN transformer is a state-of-the-art vision transformer model but its unique architecture causes slower inference speed compared to similar models. 
- Quantization can improve inference latency but prior work has not been able to fully quantize SWIN transformer.
- Non-integer operations like GELU activation are bottlenecks that reduce speedups from quantization.

Proposed Solution:
- Replace GELU activation with ReLU activation which is easily quantizable and has lower complexity. 
- Remove associated bias with GELU to completely eliminate its fused operation.
- Use iterative knowledge distillation to compensate for accuracy drops from replacing GELU with ReLU.
- Fully quantize the resulting GELU-less SWIN transformer using post-training quantization.

Results:
- Achieved over 11% inference latency reduction compared to FasterTransformer framework while maintaining under 0.5% accuracy drop on ImageNet.  
- Ablation without knowledge distillation led to 0.9% accuracy drop, showing it is essential.
- Consistent high latency improvements across SWIN transformer configurations from 12-13%.

Main Contributions:
- Novel idea to replace non-integer GELU activation with integer-friendly ReLU activation to enable fully quantized SWIN transformer.
- Using iterative knowledge distillation to maintain accuracy after replacing activations.  
- Demonstrated high inference speedups across SWIN configurations while preserving accuracy.

In summary, by removing floating-point operations associated with GELU and using knowledge distillation, the paper presents a way to fully quantize SWIN transformer that achieves over 11% faster inference without impacting accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes replacing the GELU activation in SWIN transformer with ReLU to enable fully integer quantization of the model, improving inference latency by over 11% with minimal accuracy loss through knowledge distillation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to reduce the inference latency of the int8 quantized SWIN transformer model by removing the floating-point GELU activation and replacing it with the quantizable ReLU activation. Specifically:

- They analyze the operations in the int8 quantized SWIN pipeline and identify the GELU activation as a key component that still uses floating-point and causes latency overhead. 

- They propose to replace GELU with the simpler ReLU activation, which is piecewise linear and easily quantizable. This removes the need for a separate floating-point fused operation.

- They apply this GELU replacement in a gradual block-wise manner and use knowledge distillation to maintain accuracy. 

- Their final GELU-less quantized SWIN transformer achieves over 11% lower inference latency compared to the original int8 quantized SWIN, with minimal accuracy drop.

So in summary, the key contribution is the method to reduce SWIN transformer latency via replacing GELU with ReLU and eliminating associated floating-point operations, while preserving accuracy. This improves the efficiency of the quantized SWIN model.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. Why does replacing GELU activation with ReLU help improve latency? Explain the differences in complexity between GELU and ReLU that enable faster inference.

2. The paper mentions using knowledge distillation to compensate for accuracy drop from removing GELU. Elaborate on the knowledge distillation process. What hyperparameters and settings were used? How much compute was needed?

3. The ablation study shows knowledge distillation is essential to maintain accuracy when removing GELU. Analyze why this is the case. What would happen without knowledge distillation?
