# [Collaborate to Adapt: Source-Free Graph Domain Adaptation via   Bi-directional Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the problem of source-free unsupervised graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to adapt a graph neural network (GNN) model trained on a labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph, without having access to the labeled source graph. This problem setting is practical in many real-world scenarios due to privacy regulations and intellectual property concerns over sharing source data. However, it poses significant challenges compared to traditional domain adaptation since no source labels are available, and GNNs have complex node feature and graph structure dependencies.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called GraphCTA that performs collaborative model adaptation and graph adaptation to tackle this problem. Specifically, GraphCTA first conducts model adaptation by encouraging local neighborhood and global prototype consistency to obtain domain-invariant node representations and predictions. It uses momentum memory banks to store target representations and predictions for computing robust prototypes and pseudo-labels. Next, GraphCTA performs graph adaptation by employing neighborhood contrastive learning to refine the graph structure and complement node features, facilitated by high-confidence pseudo-labeled target samples. The adapted graph then facilitates subsequent model adaptation, creating a collaborative loop.

Main Contributions:
- Investigates the novel, practical, and challenging problem setting of source-free unsupervised graph domain adaptation.
- Proposes a collaborative model and graph adaptation framework called GraphCTA to tackle this problem through an iterative process.
- Outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods significantly across extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets.
- Provides theoretical analysis to show GraphCTA's ability to minimize the target risk upper bound.
- Demonstrates the framework is model-agnostic and can generalize to different GNN architectures.

In summary, the paper explores an important but less-studied graph domain adaptation setting and makes significant contributions through the proposal of the collaborative GraphCTA framework. Experiments validate its effectiveness and versatility.
