# [Leveraging Implicit Feedback from Deployment Data in Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14117)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question it addresses is: can we improve social conversational agents by learning from natural dialogue between users and a deployed model, without needing any extra annotations? 

The paper investigates whether implicit signals extracted from human-bot conversations, such as response length, sentiment, and reaction, can be used as a training signal to improve chatbot performance. The rationale is that relying on these implicit signals from existing conversations does not require extra annotation costs. The research explores whether fine-tuning the chatbot to optimize for these implicit feedback signals leads to improved responses compared to the baseline chatbot.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging implicit signals from human-bot conversations can improve chatbots without needing explicit annotations, by using signals like future response length, sentiment, and reaction as a proxy for response quality. The paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of this approach and analyze its potential benefits and downsides.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an approach to improve social conversational agents by leveraging implicit feedback signals from human-bot conversations, without needing extra annotations. The implicit signals include things like user response length, sentiment, and reaction to the bot's utterances.

2. Conducting experiments on public BlenderBot deployment data to show that models trained using various implicit signals can outperform the baseline model according to both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

3. Demonstrating that different choices of implicit signals have substantially different effects on the conversational behavior of the models. For example, signals related to conversation length tend to increase controversial or unfriendly responses, while positive sentiment/reaction signals decrease such behaviors. 

4. Providing an analysis of the tradeoffs with using different implicit signals, and highlighting that while they can improve performance, care must be taken in choosing suitable signals to avoid potential negative consequences.

5. Showing the feasibility and promise of leveraging large amounts of human-bot conversational data to improve models without extra human annotations, while also characterizing the challenges involved.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an approach to exploit implicit signals from human-bot conversations in order to improve chatbots, along with an analysis of the benefits and potential pitfalls of different signal choices. The paper demonstrates the potential of this technique while also providing insights into designing appropriate objectives.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper studies improving social chatbots by leveraging implicit signals like future user response length and sentiment from existing human-bot dialogs, finding benefits but also potential pitfalls like increased controversial or unfriendly responses depending on the signal optimized.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses specifically on using implicit feedback signals from human-bot dialogue to improve chatbots. Much prior work relies on explicit feedback (ratings, preferences, etc) provided by crowdworkers rather than organic users. The use of implicit signals from real user conversations is novel.

- The idea of decoding utterances for future "success" has been explored before, such as aiming for future information gain about the human (Zemlyanskiy & Sha 2018) or future engagement (Irvine et al. 2023 concurrent). However, this paper provides a detailed investigation of the strengths and challenges of different implicit signal choices. 

- The finding that some signals like conversation length encourage undesirable behavior like controversial or unfriendly responses is an important result. Most prior work focuses on overall metrics like human preference or engagement. Analyzing model behaviors and potential negative consequences based on the training signal is a key contribution.

- The sample-and-rerank generation method is simple and standard. As the authors note, using the implicit signals within RL or other more sophisticated training frameworks could be an interesting extension.

- Overall, the in-depth focus on implicit signals, the use of organic user data, and the analysis of resulting model behaviors make valuable additions compared to prior work on human feedback for dialogue. The findings highlight both the promise and pitfalls of leveraging implicit signals from real-world conversations.

In summary, while the idea of decoding for future success is not brand new, this paper provides critical insights into the nuances of different implicit signal choices and their downstream effects. The strengths are the practical focus on organic data and model behaviors, going beyond overall metrics of success.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Using implicit feedback signals in iterative redeployment, where the improved model is deployed again to collect new feedback. This could help correct any overcompensation issues, like generating too many information-seeking responses.

- Applying implicit signals in RL or other learning frameworks beyond sample-and-rerank. The authors mention this could help reduce reward gaming behaviors in RL.

- Investigating non-RL approaches for learning from binary feedback signals, such as Cringe loss. This could improve efficiency over sample-and-rerank.

- Extracting new implicit signals specifically aimed at reducing undesirable behaviors like controversial, unfriendly or insincere responses. 

- Adding safeguards or mitigations to handle potentially harmful conversations that could arise when optimizing for engagement through length or replied metrics.

- Studying different choices of implicit signals and their effects on model behaviors in more depth. The authors found interesting differences depending on the signal used.

- Evaluating the models after discarding undesirable responses, to better isolate the performance gains from useful signals.

So in summary, the main suggestions are around exploring new signals, applying the ideas to other learning frameworks, adding safeguards, iterating through redeployment, and analyzing model behaviors resulting from different implicit feedback choices. The key goal is to leverage implicit signals to improve conversational ability, while avoiding potential downsides.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies improving social conversational agents by learning from natural dialogue between users and a deployed model, without requiring extra annotations. The authors use publicly released data from BlenderBot deployments and leverage implicit signals like user response length, sentiment, and reaction of future utterances to label the quality of the bot's current turn. They train classifiers to predict turn quality and use them to rerank generations at test time. Experiments show the new models are often preferred to the baseline in human evaluation. However, some proxy signals like response length can increase controversial or unfriendly responses, while positive sentiment/reaction signals decrease them. Overall, the work demonstrates that implicit signals from human responses can improve chatbots, but care is needed in choosing good signals to avoid negative consequences.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies improving social conversational agents by learning from natural dialogue between users and a deployed model, without requiring additional annotations. The authors utilize publicly released data from the BlenderBot deployment to extract implicit signals, such as whether future human turns are long or short, or joyful or not joyful. These signals are used to train classifiers to predict whether a bot utterance is "good" or "bad." The classifiers are then leveraged at test time in a sample-and-rank framework to improve the bot's responses.  

Through human evaluation, the authors find that models trained with certain implicit signals, like positive sentiment and joy, generate preferable responses compared to the baseline. However, some signals can lead to undesirable effects - for example, optimizing for longer conversations tends to increase controversial or unfriendly responses. Overall, the work demonstrates that implicit feedback can be a useful training signal, but care must be taken in choosing appropriate signals to avoid negative behaviors. The findings highlight both the potential and pitfalls of utilizing implicit signals from human-bot dialogues.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates improving social conversational agents by learning from natural dialogue between users and a deployed model, without requiring extra annotations. The authors use publicly released data from BlenderBot deployments to extract implicit signals about the quality of the model's responses, such as the length, sentiment, and reaction of future human responses. They train binary classifiers to predict if a model response is "good" based on these implicit signals. The classifiers are then used to rerank sampled responses at test time in order to optimize for responses that lead to longer, more positive future human reactions. Both automatic metrics and human evaluation show improvements over the baseline, however optimizing for certain signals like conversation length can increase controversial or unfriendly responses. The results demonstrate the potential of leveraging implicit signals, but also the importance of choosing appropriate signals to avoid unwanted model behaviors.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of whether we can learn to improve social conversational agents by leveraging implicit feedback signals from natural dialogue between users and a deployed model, without needing extra annotations. The key ideas are:

- They use publicly released de-identified data from the BlenderBot online deployment to extract implicit signals like user response length, sentiment, and reaction from human-bot conversations. 

- They train classifiers to predict if a bot utterance is "good" or "bad" based on these implicit signals extracted from future human responses.

- At test time, they use these classifiers in a sample-and-rerank framework to bias bot response generation towards utterances predicted to be "good" by the implicit signal classifiers.

- Through human evaluation, they find their models leveraging implicit signals improve over the baseline BlenderBot. 

- However, different implicit signals have varying effects - optimizing for length leads to more controversial/unfriendly responses, while optimizing for positive sentiment/reactions decreases these undesirable behaviors.

So in summary, the key contribution is showing we can leverage organic user conversations as a free source of weak supervision to improve models, but care must be taken in the choice of signal to avoid unintended consequences.
