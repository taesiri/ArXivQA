# [CLIcK: A Benchmark Dataset of Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence in   Korean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Despite rapid advances in Korean language models (LLMs), there is a lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets to evaluate their cultural and linguistic understanding of Korean. 
- Existing Korean benchmarks are either too simple, derived from English datasets through translation, or focus narrowly on specific tasks like hate speech detection. They fail to capture key aspects of Korean language and culture.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the CLIcK (Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence in Korean) benchmark dataset with 1,995 multiple choice QA pairs sourced from official Korean exams and textbooks.
- The questions cover a diverse range of topics related to Korean culture (history, law, politics, etc) and language (textual, functional, grammar). 
- Each instance is annotated with the specific cultural and linguistic knowledge required to answer correctly.

Main Contributions:
- Construction and public release of CLIcK as an authentic Korean-centric benchmark to evaluate cultural and linguistic intelligence of LLMs.
- Fine-grained categorization and annotation of the requisite knowledge to answer each question.
- Empirical evaluation of 13 LLMs on CLIcK, revealing limitations of current models and motivating further research into cultural and linguistic benchmarks.
- Analysis showing model scale and additional Korean language fine-tuning doesn't significantly enhance performance, highlighting need for more tailored methods.

In summary, the paper introduces CLIcK as the first large-scale, comprehensive benchmark focused specifically on assessing LLMs' Korean cultural and linguistic comprehension. Evaluation of models uncovers limitations and insufficient culturally-aware capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CLIcK, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating cultural and linguistic intelligence in Korean language models, comprising 1,995 multiple-choice questions derived from exams and textbooks which are categorized into 11 topics and used to assess several state-of-the-art models, revealing performance gaps compared to humans.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Constructing and publicly releasing CLIcK, a new benchmark dataset for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) cultural and linguistic understanding of Korean.

2. Providing fine-grained categorization and annotation of the knowledge required to answer each query in the dataset. The dataset is split into 11 categories under two main branches of Korean Culture and Korean Language.

3. Empirically evaluating 13 LLM model configurations, including proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and Claude-2, on the CLIcK dataset. The evaluation demonstrates current limitations of LLMs on Korean cultural and linguistic comprehension, motivating further research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- CLIcK - The name of the benchmark dataset introduced in the paper. Stands for "Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence in Korean".

- Korean culture - A main focus of the dataset is evaluating knowledge and comprehension of Korean culture.

- Korean language - Along with culture, linguistic knowledge of Korean is a key aspect tested by the dataset. 

- Benchmark dataset - The paper introduces CLIcK as a new benchmark intended to evaluate language models.

- Language models (LLMs) - The capabilities of various language models are tested using the CLIcK benchmark.

- Evaluation - A major contribution of the paper is providing a way to evaluate cultural and linguistic intelligence of LLMs for Korean. 

- Accuracy - The primary evaluation metric used in the experiments is the accuracy of models on the CLIcK questions.

- Categories - The CLIcK questions are organized into detailed categories related to cultural and linguistic knowledge.

- Human performance - Model accuracy is compared to actual human performance on exams that were data sources.
