# [SVNR: Spatially-variant Noise Removal with Denoising Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16052)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper presents SVNR, a novel denoising diffusion framework that can handle spatially-varying noise and use the noisy input image as both the condition and starting point of the diffusion process. The central hypothesis is that adapting the denoising diffusion formulation to use a spatially-varying time embedding will enable superior performance in removing realistic noise from images, compared to standard diffusion models that assume a constant noise level across the image. Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:- How can denoising diffusion models be adapted to handle spatially-varying noise distributions instead of just additive white Gaussian noise? - Can using the noisy input image as both the condition and starting point help diffusion models remove realistic noise more effectively and efficiently?- What modifications to the training and inference schemes are needed to support spatially-varying time embeddings? - How should the correlation between the noisy input condition image and diffusion samples be handled?The authors propose the SVNR framework to address these questions. By using pixel-wise time embeddings, modifying the training/inference schemes, and accounting for noise correlation, SVNR is able to leverage diffusion models more effectively for realistic denoising tasks. The experiments aim to demonstrate SVNR's advantages in balancing noise removal with detail preservation compared to standard diffusion models and state-of-the-art denoising methods.
