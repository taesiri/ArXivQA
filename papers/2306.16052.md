# [SVNR: Spatially-variant Noise Removal with Denoising Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16052)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper presents SVNR, a novel denoising diffusion framework that can handle spatially-varying noise and use the noisy input image as both the condition and starting point of the diffusion process. The central hypothesis is that adapting the denoising diffusion formulation to use a spatially-varying time embedding will enable superior performance in removing realistic noise from images, compared to standard diffusion models that assume a constant noise level across the image. Specifically, the key research questions addressed are:- How can denoising diffusion models be adapted to handle spatially-varying noise distributions instead of just additive white Gaussian noise? - Can using the noisy input image as both the condition and starting point help diffusion models remove realistic noise more effectively and efficiently?- What modifications to the training and inference schemes are needed to support spatially-varying time embeddings? - How should the correlation between the noisy input condition image and diffusion samples be handled?The authors propose the SVNR framework to address these questions. By using pixel-wise time embeddings, modifying the training/inference schemes, and accounting for noise correlation, SVNR is able to leverage diffusion models more effectively for realistic denoising tasks. The experiments aim to demonstrate SVNR's advantages in balancing noise removal with detail preservation compared to standard diffusion models and state-of-the-art denoising methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a new denoising diffusion formulation called SVDD (Spatially-Variant Denoising Diffusion) that handles spatially-varying noise. The key ideas are:- Adapting the denoising diffusion framework to use the noisy input image as both the starting point and condition for the diffusion process. This enables using significantly fewer diffusion steps.- Proposing a diffusion process with a spatially-varying time embedding to handle realistic spatially-variant noise models like camera sensor noise. - Developing training and inference schemes to support the spatially-varying time embeddings.- Addressing the noise correlation issue that arises when using the noisy input image as both the starting point and condition, by modifying the training scheme.- Demonstrating improved results over diffusion baselines on simulated noisy images, with comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods, while generating more realistic details and textures.In summary, the main contribution is a novel diffusion formulation and training approach that adapts denoising diffusion models to handle realistic spatially-variant noise distributions, enabling the use of noisy images within the diffusion process itself. This improves results while significantly reducing compute.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper presents a new denoising diffusion formulation called SVDD that handles spatially-varying noise by allowing each pixel to have its own time embedding, and proposes corresponding training and inference schemes; this enables using the noisy input image as both the condition and starting point of the diffusion process for improved denoising performance while significantly reducing the number of diffusion steps.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a new denoising diffusion model called SVDD, which handles spatially-variant noise and enables utilizing the noisy input image as both the condition and starting point of the diffusion process. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:1. Compared to traditional denoising methods like BM3D and TV-based methods, SVDD leverages the powerful image prior learned by diffusion models rather than relying only on heuristic image priors. This allows it to generate more realistic fine details.2. Compared to discriminative learning methods like DnCNN, VDN, HDDM, etc., SVDD is trained in an unsupervised manner without requiring matched noisy-clean image pairs. It also avoids some of the distortion-perception tradeoffs of these methods.3. Compared to other diffusion-based approaches, SVDD introduces novel modifications to handle spatially-variant noise and enable starting from the noisy input image. This allows much faster denoising compared to methods that start from noise. It also accounts for noise correlation between the input and samples. 4. Compared to other methods that handle non-uniform noise like FFDNet, SVDD takes a different approach based on diffusion models and spatially-varying time embeddings.5. Compared to concurrent work on diffusion-based denoising like Xie et al., SVDD proposes a unified treatment for combined signal-dependent and signal-independent noise, rather than addressing different noise types separately.Overall, SVDD pushes diffusion-based denoising capabilities further by handling more realistic noise models while retaining the benefits of diffusion models. The proposed modifications enable much faster denoising compared to diffusion baselines. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate SVDD's improved performance.
