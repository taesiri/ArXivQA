# [Generative Prompt Model for Weakly Supervised Object Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09756)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:How can we improve weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) by incorporating generative models instead of only using discriminative models? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Discriminative models like CAM suffer from partial object activation, only localizing the most discriminative object parts instead of full object extent. This is because they are optimized for classification, not precise localization. 2) Generative models like denoising diffusion probabilistic models can learn more complete object representations by reconstructing the full input image.3) By formulating WSOL as a conditional image denoising problem and learning prompt embeddings to reconstruct images of each class, a generative model can learn embeddings capturing fuller object extent. 4) Combining discriminative and generative embeddings as prompts for a diffusion model can achieve state-of-the-art WSOL performance by leveraging both discrimination and representation.So in summary, the central research question is how to improve WSOL using generative models and conditional denoising, with the hypothesis that this will enable learning more complete object representations and extent compared to pure discriminative models like CAM.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a generative prompt model (GenPromp) for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). This is the first work to formulate WSOL using a generative model rather than the conventional discriminative models. 2. Converting image category labels into learnable prompt embeddings that are fed into a generative diffusion model. This allows learning more representative features for localization compared to only using discriminative features.3. Combining discriminative embeddings from CLIP with the learned representative embeddings to get benefits of both discrimination and representation ability.4. Generating multi-scale attention maps at different noise levels from the diffusion model using the combined embeddings. These maps are aggregated for producing high quality localization.5. Achieving new state-of-the-art results on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet, outperforming prior discriminative models by significant margins. This demonstrates the advantage of the generative modeling approach for WSOL.6. Providing a new perspective and strong baseline for utilizing generative models for weakly supervised visual learning problems.In summary, the key innovation is formulating WSOL as an image denoising problem and using prompt embeddings with generative models to overcome issues with purely discriminative approaches. The generative modeling framework allows learning more representative features for precise localization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review, the one-sentence TL;DR summary of this paper would be: This paper proposes a generative prompt model for weakly supervised object localization that formulates WSOL as a conditional image denoising procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance by combining discriminative and representative embeddings queried from a vision-language model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in weakly supervised object localization:- This paper proposes a novel generative framework (GenPromp) for WSOL, in contrast to prior work that uses discriminative models. Formulating WSOL as a conditional image denoising task is a unique approach not explored before.- Most prior WSOL methods rely on class activation maps (CAM) from CNNs trained with image-level labels. This often leads to partial object activation. GenPromp addresses this fundamental limitation by combining discriminative and generative features.- Unlike methods that iteratively erase object regions or use adversarial training, GenPromp takes a more direct approach to learning complete object representations via denoising autoencoding conditioned on class prompts.- The proposed generative pipeline with prompt learning achieves new state-of-the-art results on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet, significantly outperforming prior discriminative models. This demonstrates the promise of generative models for WSOL.- GenPromp is the first work to exploit vision-language models (CLIP) for querying discriminative prompts in a WSOL framework. This allows tapping into the pretrained knowledge in CLIP.- Most prior arts use CNN backbones for feature extraction. GenPromp shows strong results can be obtained using a transformer-based generative model, opening up new possibilities.In summary, this paper introduces a novel perspective to WSOL using generative modeling and prompts, with results surpassing prior arts. It highlights the potential of combining discriminative and generative features for better weakly supervised localization. The use of CLIP prompts is also innovative.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring different model architectures for the generative prompt model, such as transformer-based models like Swin Transformers, to further improve localization performance. - Extending the approach to more challenging weakly supervised object detection and segmentation tasks. The authors suggest their method shows potential for these applications.- Reducing the dependency on large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to improve inference speed and GPU memory efficiency. The authors acknowledge this as a current disadvantage.- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of datasets beyond CUB and ImageNet to assess generalization.- ExploringSemi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods to reduce annotation cost. The generative model may be amenable to leveraging unlabeled data.- Combining ideas from the generative model with other techniques like adversarial learning to build on the benefits of both generative and discriminative modeling.- Studying theoretical connections between the model learning process and human cognition for a better understanding.Overall, the main directions are around architectural improvements, extending to harder tasks, reducing computational costs, evaluating generalization, incorporating unlabeled data, and combining ideas with discriminative methods. The authors lay out promising future work building on their generative modeling approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a generative prompt model (GenPromp) for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). Conventional WSOL methods using discriminatively trained models often suffer from activating only the most discriminative object parts instead of the full object extent. GenPromp addresses this issue by formulating WSOL as a conditional image denoising problem. During training, GenPromp converts image category labels to learnable prompt embeddings, which are fed to a generative model to recover the noisy input image. This allows learning representative prompt embeddings that capture common object features. At inference time, the learned prompt embeddings are combined with discriminative embeddings from CLIP to obtain both representative and discriminative capacity. The combined embeddings generate multi-scale attention maps to localize full object extent.Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet show that GenPromp outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative WSOL methods, demonstrating the advantage of using generative models. The proposed framework provides a new perspective for WSOL using vision-language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a generative prompt model called GenPromp for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). WSOL aims to learn object localization from image category labels only, which is challenging since conventional methods relying on discriminative models tend to activate only the most discriminative object parts instead of full object extent. To address this, GenPromp formulates WSOL as a conditional image denoising problem. During training, it learns a representative prompt embedding by using it to denoise images from each category. At inference, it combines this with a discriminative embedding from CLIP to generate multi-scale attention maps covering full object extent. Specifically, GenPromp has a training stage where it queries a discriminative embedding from CLIP using the image's category, and learns a representative embedding by using it to denoise category images. The denoising formulation allows learning features identifying whole objects rather than just discriminative parts. It then finetunes the model on the target dataset. At inference, it combines the learned representative embedding with a discriminative embedding from CLIP. This combined embedding prompts the model to generate multi-scale attention maps, which are aggregated to predict the object location. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet show GenPromp outperforms previous state-of-the-art discriminative models by large margins. The results demonstrate the advantage of using generative modeling for WSOL compared to conventional discriminative methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a generative prompt model called GenPromp for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). GenPromp treats WSOL as a conditional image denoising problem. During training, it converts image category labels into learnable prompt embeddings that are fed into a generative model (Stable Diffusion) to recover a noisy input image and learn representative embeddings. During inference, it combines the learned representative embeddings with discriminative embeddings queried from an off-the-shelf vision-language model (CLIP) to get both representative and discriminative features. The combined embeddings are used to generate multi-scale attention maps that localize objects. Key aspects are learning representative embeddings through conditional image denoising and combining them with discriminative embeddings from CLIP to capitalize on the strengths of both for precise localization maps.
