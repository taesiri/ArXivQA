# [Generative Prompt Model for Weakly Supervised Object Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09756)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:How can we improve weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) by incorporating generative models instead of only using discriminative models? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Discriminative models like CAM suffer from partial object activation, only localizing the most discriminative object parts instead of full object extent. This is because they are optimized for classification, not precise localization. 2) Generative models like denoising diffusion probabilistic models can learn more complete object representations by reconstructing the full input image.3) By formulating WSOL as a conditional image denoising problem and learning prompt embeddings to reconstruct images of each class, a generative model can learn embeddings capturing fuller object extent. 4) Combining discriminative and generative embeddings as prompts for a diffusion model can achieve state-of-the-art WSOL performance by leveraging both discrimination and representation.So in summary, the central research question is how to improve WSOL using generative models and conditional denoising, with the hypothesis that this will enable learning more complete object representations and extent compared to pure discriminative models like CAM.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a generative prompt model (GenPromp) for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). This is the first work to formulate WSOL using a generative model rather than the conventional discriminative models. 2. Converting image category labels into learnable prompt embeddings that are fed into a generative diffusion model. This allows learning more representative features for localization compared to only using discriminative features.3. Combining discriminative embeddings from CLIP with the learned representative embeddings to get benefits of both discrimination and representation ability.4. Generating multi-scale attention maps at different noise levels from the diffusion model using the combined embeddings. These maps are aggregated for producing high quality localization.5. Achieving new state-of-the-art results on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet, outperforming prior discriminative models by significant margins. This demonstrates the advantage of the generative modeling approach for WSOL.6. Providing a new perspective and strong baseline for utilizing generative models for weakly supervised visual learning problems.In summary, the key innovation is formulating WSOL as an image denoising problem and using prompt embeddings with generative models to overcome issues with purely discriminative approaches. The generative modeling framework allows learning more representative features for precise localization.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my review, the one-sentence TL;DR summary of this paper would be: This paper proposes a generative prompt model for weakly supervised object localization that formulates WSOL as a conditional image denoising procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance by combining discriminative and representative embeddings queried from a vision-language model.
