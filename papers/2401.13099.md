# [Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics in the presence of library   and system uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The SINDy algorithm is a popular method for identifying governing equations of dynamical systems from time series data. However, it relies on two key assumptions - (1) the variables in the system are known, and (2) the functional form of the governing equations is contained in a library of basis functions provided to the algorithm. 

- In practice, these assumptions often do not hold - researchers may only know a superset of variables, and the exact functional forms may be unknown. This limits the applicability of SINDy.

- The paper aims to make SINDy more robust to violations of these two assumptions using augmentation techniques.

Methods
- For handling unknown variables, the paper utilizes causal discovery techniques to distinguish between causal and non-causal variables. This Augmented SINDy method was previously shown to work on synthetic data.

- For missing basis functions, the paper adapts sparse coding to learn the missing functions, creating an expanded library. 

- Experiments were conducted by incorporating noisy variables into real-world ecosystem datasets, and removing subset of basis functions. Performance was measured using custom metrics.

Results
- Augmented SINDy consistently outperformed regular SINDy on real-world ecology datasets in the presence of extra noisy variables. It correctly excluded the noisy variables from the inferred equations.

- When both variable uncertainty and unknown functional forms were present, combining Augmented SINDy and sparse-coding-based function learning outperformed regular SINDy by a large margin across several dynamical systems.

Conclusions
- The results provide strong evidence that SINDy can be made significantly more robust to uncertainties in variables and functional forms using augmentation techniques.

- This enables the application of SINDy to identify governing equations in domains like ecology where getting perfect knowledge of variables and functional forms is often infeasible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper demonstrates that augmenting SINDy with techniques from causal discovery and sparse coding enables it to perform robustly in identifying governing equations from time-series data, even in the presence of uncertainties about the system variables and function library.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be demonstrating that augmenting SINDy with techniques from causal discovery and sparse coding allows it to perform robustly in identifying governing equations even when there is uncertainty about both the system variables and the function library/dictionary. 

Specifically, the key contributions seem to be:

1) Showing that Augmented SINDy outperforms regular SINDy on real-world ecological data when there is uncertainty about the system variables (Experiments 1 and 2).

2) Demonstrating that combining Augmented SINDy with a technique adapted from sparse coding to learn missing functions allows SINDy to accurately identify governing equations even when there is uncertainty about both the system variables and the function library (Experiment 3). 

3) Providing evidence that extensions of SINDy can enable it to be broadly applicable even in situations of realistic uncertainty about the systems being studied.

So in summary, the main contribution appears to be expanding the applicability of SINDy to identify governing equations under more realistic uncertainty by augmenting it with causal discovery and sparse coding techniques.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an Augmented SINDy algorithm that combines techniques from causal discovery to make SINDy more robust to uncertainty in the system variables. Can you explain in more detail how causal discovery techniques are incorporated and how they help address this limitation of standard SINDy?

2. The paper shows Augmented SINDy performs well on real-world ecological data. What specific challenges arise when applying SINDy in ecological contexts compared to other domains? How does Augmented SINDy help mitigate those challenges?  

3. The Fraction of Possible Incorrect Variables (FPIV) metric is used to evaluate performance. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this metric? Are there other metrics you would suggest to capture performance on real-world ecological data?

4. For the experiment with the lynx-hare system, what motivated the choice of distributions used to generate the synthetic noise variables $x_1$ and $x_2$? How sensitive are the results to the distributions chosen?  

5. The paper proposes combining Augmented SINDy with a technique to learn missing functions in the SINDy dictionary. How exactly is sparse coding adapted to enable basis learning? What modifications were made compared to standard sparse coding?

6. The Fraction of Dictionary Elements Correctly Selected (FDECS) metric is used to evaluate performance when there is uncertainty in both the system variables and dictionary. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this metric? 

7. For the experiments in Section 4 involving dual uncertainty, what motivated the choice of dynamical systems used? Would you expect similar performance on other systems not tested?

8. The paper shows improved performance from combining techniques to address variable uncertainty and dictionary uncertainty. Do you think these improvements are additive or synergistic? Why?

9. Can you foresee any practical challenges in applying the proposed Augmented SINDy method with basis learning on real-world messy data? What precautions should researchers take?

10. The paper focuses narrowly on improving SINDy under two assumptions. How might the proposed techniques fit into broader efforts to make discovery of dynamics from data more robust and trustworthy?
