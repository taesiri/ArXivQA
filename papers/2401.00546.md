# [AllSpark: a multimodal spatiotemporal general model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Leveraging multimodal data is crucial for geographic object cognition. However, different modalities are highly heterogeneous in structure and semantics, making joint interpretation very challenging. The key difficulty lies in balancing the cohesion (shared information) and autonomy (unique information) among modalities, which becomes progressively harder as more modalities are added.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF) to address this challenge. Inspired by human perception converging into language, LaRF aligns all modalities to a unified language representation. Based on LaRF, the authors build AllSpark, a multimodal spatiotemporal general AI model encompassing 13 modalities. 

To achieve cohesion, AllSpark maps all modal features to language using modality-specific text prompts and a multimodal language model. To maintain autonomy, it uses independent encoders for each modality and a modality bridge to project tokens into the language space. Lightweight task heads are added to match model interpretation and downstream tasks.

Main Contributions:

- Propose LaRF for constructing multimodal models to balance cohesion and autonomy. LaRF offers capabilities like reasoning, interpretability and interactivity.

- Present AllSpark, first model unifying 13 spatiotemporal modalities using LaRF. AllSpark shows potential for extending to any number of modalities.

- AllSpark achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art in RGB, trajectory etc. without modality expert knowledge. It also adapts well to modalities like point clouds, spectral imagery.

- Demonstrate feasibility of building general AI with large language models. Contribute to paradigm shift from modality/task-specific to general models in spatiotemporal intelligence.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in presenting a novel framework LaRF for multimodal fusion, proposing AllSpark as an instantiation unifying 13 modalities, and showing potential for developing general AI models in spatiotemporal domain.
