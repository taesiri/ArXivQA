# [Comparing Bad Apples to Good Oranges: Aligning Large Language Models via   Joint Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00530)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional approaches for aligning large language models (LLMs) rely on acquiring human preferences by comparing multiple model generations conditioned on a fixed context. However, such conditional rankings often fail to capture the complex, multidimensional aspects of human preferences.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose eliciting preferences jointly over instruction-response pairs, rather than just conditioned on a fixed instruction. For example, comparing the quality of a response summarizing Article A to the quality of a different response summarizing Article B. 
- They introduce a new preference optimization algorithm called DOVE that directly optimizes the joint probability of the chosen instruction-response pair over the rejected pair.

Key Contributions:
- Propose a new paradigm for acquiring richer preference data by eliciting rankings over instruction-response pairs, rather than just responses conditioned on identical instructions. 
- Introduce DOVE, a novel preference optimization algorithm that can effectively utilize this joint preference data for aligning LLMs.
- Empirically demonstrate that DOVE helps align LLMs more robustly than prior preference optimization methods, improving performance on summarization and dialogue tasks.
- Provide analysis showing joint elicitation uncovers new complex reasoning dimensions in preference decisions versus traditional conditional rankings.

In summary, the key insight is that modeling preferences over joint instruction-response pairs, rather than just responses, can enable acquiring richer signals for robustly aligning LLMs. The proposed DOVE algorithm leverages this to improve alignment over prior preference optimization techniques.
