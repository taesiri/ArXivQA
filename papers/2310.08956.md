# [LRRU: Long-short Range Recurrent Updating Networks for Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08956)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to design an efficient and lightweight deep network architecture for depth completion that can achieve better performance while maintaining efficiency compared to existing methods?

The key points are:

- Depth completion aims to estimate dense depth maps from sparse depth measurements. It is challenging to directly predict accurate dense depth from sparse input. 

- Existing methods rely on massive parameters and computations to learn robust features. But their efficiency is limited.

- This paper proposes a novel lightweight framework called LRRU that iteratively updates an initial coarse depth map to get an accurate one.

- The core of LRRU is the proposed Target-Dependent Update (TDU) unit and long-short range recurrent strategy, which make the update process content-adaptive and flexible.

- Extensive experiments show LRRU variants achieve state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. The LRRU-Base model obtains the best results on KITTI benchmark.

In summary, the central research question is how to design a lightweight and efficient network architecture for depth completion. The key hypothesis is iteratively updating an initial coarse depth map through proposed content-adaptive and flexible units can lead to better accuracy and efficiency. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method LRRU.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel lightweight deep network architecture called Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) network for depth completion. The key ideas include:

1. It proposes to first fill the sparse depth map using a simple non-learning method, and then iteratively update the initial depth map using the proposed Target-Dependent Update (TDU) unit. This avoids directly regressing dense depth from sparse input.

2. It proposes a long-short range recurrent strategy that dynamically adjusts the kernel scope from large to small during the iterative update process. This allows capturing long-to-short range dependencies efficiently with fewer iterations. 

3. It proposes the TDU unit that updates each pixel by learning spatially-variant kernels. The kernels are predicted by jointly using cross-guided features from RGB/sparse depth and self-guided features from the target depth map itself. This makes the update process adaptive.

4. Extensive experiments show the LRRU network outperforms previous state-of-the-art with higher efficiency. The smallest LRRU-Mini model already surpasses some large models.

In summary, the key contribution is the overall lightweight LRRU network and the novel strategies for iterative depth map updating, which achieves new state-of-the-art results for depth completion. The method is efficient and effective.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight deep network architecture called Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) for depth completion, which iteratively updates an initial coarse depth map obtained by non-learning approaches through a flexible recurrent process that dynamically adjusts kernel scopes and adaptively learns spatially-variant kernels based on both cross-modal and self-modal guidance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of depth completion:

- This paper proposes a new iterative depth refinement approach called Long-Short Range Recurrent Updating Networks (LRRU). It differs from many existing depth completion methods that rely on direct regression networks to predict dense depth from sparse input. 

- Compared to other iterative refinement approaches like spatial propagation networks (SPNs), LRRU introduces two key innovations: (1) A target-dependent update unit that is adaptive to the content of each depth map being refined, (2) A long-short range recurrent strategy that dynamically adjusts the kernel size/receptive field during iterations. These allow LRRU to achieve better results with fewer iterations.

- The experiments comprehensively evaluate different model sizes of LRRU on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) datasets. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different parameter regimes, which is a key advantage over prior works.

- In particular, the smallest LRRU-Mini model already surpasses some much larger prior models in accuracy. And the largest LRRU-Base achieves the lowest error on KITTI benchmark, outperforming all existing published methods.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights into the contribution of different components of LRRU. The long-short range strategy and target-dependent unit are shown to be critical for the performance.

- Overall, I think this paper makes good contributions in proposing a new iterative depth refinement approach that is lightweight yet accurate. The comparisons on benchmark datasets convincingly demonstrate the state-of-the-art results and efficiency of LRRU. It's a solid paper advancing the depth completion field.

In summary, the key advantages of this paper compared to related works are the novel LRRU architecture for iterative refinement, superior accuracy and efficiency demonstrated through extensive experiments, and ablation studies providing insights into the approach. The results on benchmark datasets highlight the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the method.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring the application of the proposed LRRU method to other dense prediction tasks such as monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. The authors developed LRRU for depth completion, but suggest the framework could be useful for other related tasks.

- Investigating different variants of the proposed Target-Dependent Update (TDU) unit. The paper proposed one version of the TDU but there could be other ways to design the unit that are worth exploring. 

- Extending LRRU to incorporate multi-scale features or other forms of guidance. The current version utilizes RGB images and sparse depth for guidance, but other modalities could also be integrated.

- Optimizing the efficiency and runtime of LRRU, especially for real-time applications. The authors demonstrate LRRU is lightweight but further speed and memory optimizations could be done.

- Evaluating LRRU on additional diverse datasets beyond KITTI and NYUv2. Testing on more datasets would better analyze the generalization of LRRU.

- Combining ideas from LRRU with other state-of-the-art methods. For example, incorporating LRRU's updating scheme into other network architectures.

- Investigating unsupervised or self-supervised training regimes for LRRU. The current version requires dense depth supervision. Removing this could enable more applications.

In summary, the key directions relate to extending LRRU to new tasks and datasets, optimizing its efficiency, and combining its ideas with other approaches to further advance depth completion and dense prediction research. The iterative updating scheme shows promise on its own but also could integrate well with existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel lightweight deep network framework called Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) for depth completion. Given a sparse depth map, LRRU first fills it using a non-learning method to get an initial coarse depth map. Then it iteratively updates this initial map using a proposed Target-Dependent Update unit and a long-short range recurrent strategy. The update unit adapts to the content of the target depth map using both cross-guided features from the RGB image and sparse depth, and self-guided features from the depth map itself. The recurrent strategy dynamically adjusts the kernel scope from large to small during the iterative updates to capture long-to-short range dependencies. Experiments show that LRRU variants achieve state-of-the-art performance across different parameter regimes, with the LRRU-Base model outperforming previous methods on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets. The framework is lightweight and efficient compared to conventional direct regression approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel lightweight deep network architecture called LRRU (Long-short Range Recurrent Updating) for depth completion. Depth completion aims to estimate dense depth maps from sparse depth input, which is useful for applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality. Existing methods rely on massive stacked filters and layers to directly regress dense depth maps. However, LRRU takes a different approach by first filling in the sparse depth using a simple non-learning method to get an initial coarse depth map. It then refines this map through a proposed Target-Dependent Update (TDU) unit, which models spatially-variant kernels to capture neighbors and affinities for each pixel. TDU is guided by both cross-guided features from the input RGB image and sparse depth, as well as self-guided features from the target depth map itself. This allows the update process to be adaptive and dependent on the content. In addition, a long-short range recurrent strategy is proposed where the kernel scope dynamically adjusts from large to small over the iterations, enabling efficient capture of long-to-short range dependencies with just 4 iterations. 

Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the LRRU variants, which achieve a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. The smallest LRRU-Mini model even outperforms some larger existing methods. More importantly, LRRU-Base achieves the top-ranked result on the KITTI benchmark, being the first method to obtain an RMSE under 700mm. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component of LRRU. The novel lightweight architecture is shown to be superior to direct regression approaches, especially when model size is limited.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel lightweight deep network architecture for depth completion called Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) network. The key ideas are:

1) Instead of directly regressing a dense depth map from a sparse input, LRRU first roughly fills the sparse input using a non-learning method to obtain an initial coarse depth map. 

2) It then iteratively refines this initial map through a proposed Target-Dependent Update (TDU) unit, which updates each pixel by aggregating information from relevant neighbours guided by features from the RGB image, sparse depth, and current estimate.

3) A long-short range recurrent update strategy is used where larger to smaller kernel sizes are employed over iterations, allowing long-range dependencies to be modeled early and short-range finer details later on. 

4) The TDU unit learns residuals and uses self-guided and cross-guided features to make the updates adaptive to the input and current estimate. Various design choices like mean subtraction and fixing the reference pixel are used to improve training stability.

The lightweight iterative updating framework is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NYUv2 depth completion benchmarks while being efficient, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- Depth completion is an important task for applications like autonomous driving and AR/VR, but existing depth sensors have limitations that lead to sparse depth maps. 

- Existing deep learning methods for depth completion rely on massive stacked layers/filters to directly regress a dense depth map from the sparse input. This is computationally expensive and struggles to capture fine details.

- The paper proposes a lightweight deep network called Long-short Range Recurrent Updating Network (LRRU) for efficient and accurate depth completion. 

- The key ideas are:
   - Pre-fill the sparse depth map using a simple method to get an initial coarse estimate
   - Iteratively update this estimate using a proposed Target-Dependent Update unit
   - Use a flexible long-short range recurrent strategy to adjust the kernel scope and capture both long and short range dependencies
   - Make the updates adaptive based on both RGB/sparse depth (cross-guided) and current estimate (self-guided) features

- Experiments show LRRU variants achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer parameters and faster runtime compared to prior works. The LRRU-Base model achieves the lowest error on the KITTI benchmark.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel lightweight network architecture for depth completion that leverages iterative updating with adaptive kernels to efficiently refine an initial coarse depth map. This is shown to be more accurate and efficient than existing direct regression or spatial propagation based approaches.
