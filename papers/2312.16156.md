# [From Text to Multimodal: A Comprehensive Survey of Adversarial Example   Generation in Question Answering Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16156)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive review of adversarial example generation techniques in the field of question answering (QA) systems, spanning both textual and multimodal contexts. 

The paper begins by providing background on traditional QA systems and their recent advances using deep learning architectures. It then delves into the emerging vulnerability of these systems to adversarial examples - inputs purposefully modified to cause incorrect outputs, while being virtually indistinguishable from genuine inputs.

The core focus of the paper is examining strategies for generating adversarial examples to expose weaknesses in textual QA systems. It systematically categorizes these into rule-based perturbations (e.g. paraphrasing questions, changing word order) and more advanced generative models like GANs. Both approaches craft tricky questions that reveal flaws in QA systems' language understanding and reasoning. 

The scope then extends to multimodal QA systems that incorporate textual, visual or audio data. Following an overview of challenges in effectively integrating multiple modalities, the paper surveys adversarial generation techniques tailored to these systems. This includes generative models, encoder-decoder architectures, and hybrid methods that alter textual questions, images or videos to undermine performance.

Additionally, the paper reviews countermeasures like adversarial training to improve robustness of QA systems. It also analyzes adversarial datasets crafted to evaluate system vulnerabilities, along with quantitative metrics to assess the impact of attacks. 

Finally, promising research directions are discussed like leveraging human-in-the-loop evaluation to identify ambiguous inputs, improving multimodal analysis, and advancing privacy-preserving defenses against exploits.

In summary, this paper delivers a structured analysis into adversarial attack methods exposing reliability issues in state-of-the-art QA systems, across both language and vision domains. It highlights important open challenges to make these systems more secure and robust when facing manipulated inputs.
