# [Language Models Meet World Models: Embodied Experiences Enhance Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10626)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can language models be enhanced by injecting embodied knowledge and skills using experiences gathered from world models/simulators? 

The key hypothesis appears to be: Finetuning language models on diverse embodied experiences from world models can enhance their ability to reason about and generate language related to physical environments and embodied tasks, while retaining their general language modeling capabilities.

In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates a new training paradigm called "Finetuning with Embodied Experiences from World Models (E2WM)" which involves:

1) Collecting diverse embodied experiences using goal-oriented planning and random exploration in a world model/simulator (VirtualHome). 

2) Finetuning language models on supervised tasks constructed from these experiences to teach skills like goal planning, object tracking, etc.

3) Using EWC and LoRA techniques to regularize finetuning to avoid catastrophic forgetting of original LM capabilities.

The central hypothesis is that this E2WM approach can enhance language models with generalizable embodied knowledge and skills that transfer to improved performance on unseen downstream tasks, without compromising their linguistic competence on the original pretraining data. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is how to inject embodied knowledge into LMs using world models, and the central hypothesis is that the proposed E2WM paradigm can achieve this effectively. The experiments evaluate this hypothesis. Please let me know if I have accurately captured the core research problem and hypothesis!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new training paradigm to enhance pretrained language models with embodied knowledge from world models, without sacrificing the language models' generality. 

Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

- Leveraging world models (simulators of the physical world) to gather diverse embodied experiences through goal-oriented planning and random exploration.

- Compiling the embodied experiences into supervised training data to finetune language models, in order to teach them knowledge and skills like planning, object tracking, etc. 

- Introducing EWC-LoRA, which combines Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for efficient and selective parameter updates during finetuning. This helps retain the language models' broad capabilities while adapting them to the new embodied experiences.

- Conducting experiments on GPT-Neo and GPT-J models. Results demonstrate significant improvement on various downstream tasks requiring embodied knowledge, without hurting language modeling performance on the original pretraining data.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a new paradigm for augmenting pretrained language models with embodied knowledge from simulators, while preserving model generality and language competence. The introduced techniques like EWC-LoRA are shown effective for selective and efficient adaptation.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related work in training language models:

- Most prior work has focused on either "utilizing" language models for embodied tasks by freezing the model and adding specialized modules/prompts, or directly fine-tuning the full model for task optimization. In contrast, this paper aims to "improve" the language model itself by acquiring new knowledge and skills from embodied experiences in world models. The goal is enhancing the model's capabilities while retaining its generality.

- The idea of using world models to provide embodied experiences is relatively new for language model training. Prior work in this direction has been limited to using the experiences for task-specific training, rather than for generally enhancing the model. This paper explores using diverse experiences from world models for more comprehensive knowledge acquisition.

- The proposed training paradigm of finetuning with Embodied Experiences from World Models (E2WM) is novel. It involves systematic collection of diverse experiences via goal-oriented planning and random exploration, compilation into finetuning tasks, and careful regularization to preserve model capabilities.

- For regularization during finetuning, this paper introduces the new EWC-LoRA method which combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC) with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Most prior work has used KL divergence regularization instead. Experiments show EWC-LoRA is more effective for preserving model generality.

- Through extensive experiments on various downstream tasks, this paper demonstrates that the proposed E2WM paradigm enables significant improvements in reasoning and planning abilities of language models, without sacrificing their original capabilities. Small LMs enhanced via this approach even exceed the performance of much larger models.

In summary, this paper proposes a new training methodology to generally enhance language models, in contrast to prior work that focuses on task-specific optimization. The experiments highlight the promise of this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors of the paper include:

- Testing the proposed approach on different types of world models beyond the household environment of VirtualHome used in this work. The authors mention the desire to study integrating experiences from different world models and generalizing knowledge learned in one domain to another.

- Exploring integration with low-level world models that support primitive actions (e.g. turn right 15 degrees) rather than the high-level actions in VirtualHome (e.g. grab apple). The authors suggest incorporating hierarchical planning to bridge low-level and high-level actions.

- Mitigating risks of unintended or harmful output when the trained language models are deployed outside of research environments. The authors advise implementing mechanisms like filtering to avoid potential misuse.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of downstream tasks beyond those constructed for evaluation in this paper. The authors aim to demonstrate the enhanced general embodied reasoning abilities, so testing on more diverse tasks would further validate this.

- Studying lifelong and continual learning settings where new world models and experiences are incrementally added to an existing trained model over time. The authors propose their EWC-LoRA technique provides a good starting point to avoid catastrophic forgetting in these settings.

- Comparing to more baselines like reinforcement learning based methods for embedding world experience, in addition to the supervised learning approach studied here.

In summary, the key directions are expanding the approach to more diverse worlds and tasks, ensuring safe deployment, and studying continual/lifelong learning scenarios. The authors propose this as promising future work to build on their presented methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new training paradigm to enhance language models with embodied knowledge and skills using world models. The key idea is to gather diverse embodied experiences from physics-based simulators through goal-oriented planning and random exploration. These experiences are then used to finetune language models on various self-supervised tasks like plan generation, object tracking, etc. To enable efficient training and prevent catastrophic forgetting, the authors propose a regularization method called EWC-LoRA which combines Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). EWC helps retain important parameters for language modeling while LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters. Experiments on multiple downstream tasks show the approach significantly improves baseline language models like GPT-Neo and GPT-J without hurting their original capabilities. The finetuned models even exceed the performance of much larger models like ChatGPT on certain tasks. Overall, the work presents a promising training paradigm to inject embodied knowledge into language models while maintaining their generality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new training paradigm to enhance language models (LMs) using embodied experiences gathered from world models, which are physics-based simulators of the real world. The key idea is to have agents interact with a world model to collect diverse embodied experiences through goal-oriented planning and random exploration. The experiences are then used to construct supervised training tasks to finetune LMs, teaching them to reason about physical environments. To enable efficient and continual knowledge acquisition while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of original capabilities, the authors introduce a novel regularization technique called EWC-LoRA that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC) with low-rank adapters (LoRA). 

Experiments are conducted by building tasks using the VirtualHome simulator as the world model and evaluating on GPT-Neo and GPT-J models. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the LMs' ability to solve tasks requiring embodied reasoning (e.g. planning, tracking objects), improving over baselines on both seen training and unseen evaluation tasks. Notably, the small finetuned LMs even exceed the much larger ChatGPT on certain tasks. Furthermore, EWC-LoRA succeeds in preserving the original language modeling performance. The work provides a promising direction of leveraging world models to inject physical knowledge and skills into language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a new training paradigm to enhance language models (LMs) by leveraging embodied experiences gathered from world models. The key idea is to deploy an agent in a simulated world model environment to collect diverse embodied experiences through two approaches - goal-oriented planning and random exploration. In goal-oriented planning, the agent uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to find plans to complete given household activities and goals. In random exploration, the agent wanders aimlessly executing random actions while tracking object locations. These embodied experiences are then compiled into training data for finetuning the LMs on several tasks like plan generation, counting, etc. To enable efficient training and prevent catastrophic forgetting, the method introduces EWC-LoRA which combines Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). EWC uses a constraint based on the Fisher matrix to preserve important parameters for past tasks while LoRA trains low-rank adapter matrices for efficiency. Experiments show the approach significantly improves LMs on various embodied reasoning tasks without losing performance on language modeling.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Language models (LMs) have shown strong performance on many natural language tasks, but they lack embodied knowledge and experiences that are important for reasoning and planning in physical environments. 

- The authors propose a new training paradigm to enhance LMs by leveraging world models, which are physics-based simulators that emulate real-world environments. 

- They introduce two methods to gather diverse embodied experiences from a world model - goal-oriented planning and random exploration. These experiences are then compiled into training data to finetune the LMs.

- To retain the original capabilities of LMs and enable efficient training, they propose EWC-LoRA which combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC) and low-rank adapters (LoRA). This allows incorporating new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous abilities. 

- Experiments on various downstream tasks show their method significantly improves LMs without losing performance on the original pretraining data. The enhanced LMs even surpass much larger models like ChatGPT on some tasks.

In summary, the key problem is the lack of embodied knowledge and experiences in current LMs, and the authors propose to address this by leveraging world models to gather embodied experiences for finetuning LMs, while using EWC-LoRA to retain model capabilities. The overall goal is to enhance LMs with physical reasoning abilities.
