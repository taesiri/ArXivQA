# Language Models Meet World Models: Embodied Experiences Enhance Language   Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can language models be enhanced by injecting embodied knowledge and skills using experiences gathered from world models/simulators? The key hypothesis appears to be: Finetuning language models on diverse embodied experiences from world models can enhance their ability to reason about and generate language related to physical environments and embodied tasks, while retaining their general language modeling capabilities.In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates a new training paradigm called "Finetuning with Embodied Experiences from World Models (E2WM)" which involves:1) Collecting diverse embodied experiences using goal-oriented planning and random exploration in a world model/simulator (VirtualHome). 2) Finetuning language models on supervised tasks constructed from these experiences to teach skills like goal planning, object tracking, etc.3) Using EWC and LoRA techniques to regularize finetuning to avoid catastrophic forgetting of original LM capabilities.The central hypothesis is that this E2WM approach can enhance language models with generalizable embodied knowledge and skills that transfer to improved performance on unseen downstream tasks, without compromising their linguistic competence on the original pretraining data. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is how to inject embodied knowledge into LMs using world models, and the central hypothesis is that the proposed E2WM paradigm can achieve this effectively. The experiments evaluate this hypothesis. Please let me know if I have accurately captured the core research problem and hypothesis!


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new training paradigm to enhance pretrained language models with embodied knowledge from world models, without sacrificing the language models' generality. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- Leveraging world models (simulators of the physical world) to gather diverse embodied experiences through goal-oriented planning and random exploration.- Compiling the embodied experiences into supervised training data to finetune language models, in order to teach them knowledge and skills like planning, object tracking, etc. - Introducing EWC-LoRA, which combines Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for efficient and selective parameter updates during finetuning. This helps retain the language models' broad capabilities while adapting them to the new embodied experiences.- Conducting experiments on GPT-Neo and GPT-J models. Results demonstrate significant improvement on various downstream tasks requiring embodied knowledge, without hurting language modeling performance on the original pretraining data.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a new paradigm for augmenting pretrained language models with embodied knowledge from simulators, while preserving model generality and language competence. The introduced techniques like EWC-LoRA are shown effective for selective and efficient adaptation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new training paradigm for finetuning language models using embodied experiences gathered from simulated world models to enhance their physical reasoning and planning abilities, while preserving their language modeling performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related work in training language models:- Most prior work has focused on either "utilizing" language models for embodied tasks by freezing the model and adding specialized modules/prompts, or directly fine-tuning the full model for task optimization. In contrast, this paper aims to "improve" the language model itself by acquiring new knowledge and skills from embodied experiences in world models. The goal is enhancing the model's capabilities while retaining its generality.- The idea of using world models to provide embodied experiences is relatively new for language model training. Prior work in this direction has been limited to using the experiences for task-specific training, rather than for generally enhancing the model. This paper explores using diverse experiences from world models for more comprehensive knowledge acquisition.- The proposed training paradigm of finetuning with Embodied Experiences from World Models (E2WM) is novel. It involves systematic collection of diverse experiences via goal-oriented planning and random exploration, compilation into finetuning tasks, and careful regularization to preserve model capabilities.- For regularization during finetuning, this paper introduces the new EWC-LoRA method which combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC) with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Most prior work has used KL divergence regularization instead. Experiments show EWC-LoRA is more effective for preserving model generality.- Through extensive experiments on various downstream tasks, this paper demonstrates that the proposed E2WM paradigm enables significant improvements in reasoning and planning abilities of language models, without sacrificing their original capabilities. Small LMs enhanced via this approach even exceed the performance of much larger models.In summary, this paper proposes a new training methodology to generally enhance language models, in contrast to prior work that focuses on task-specific optimization. The experiments highlight the promise of this direction.
