# [XAI for Skin Cancer Detection with Prototypes and Non-Expert Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Skin cancer detection through image analysis is critical, but existing models lack interpretability and transparency, raising concerns among physicians about using black-box models in medicine. 
- Interpretable models like ProtoPNet can provide intuitive visual explanations by comparing parts of the image to learned prototypes. However, classical ProtoPNet often lacks diverse and clinically relevant prototypes, limiting interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an enhanced ProtoPNet model for interpretable melanoma classification using additional supervision techniques to improve prototype quality:
  1) Binary masks obtained from a segmentation network to identify lesion interior/boundary
  2) User-refined prototypes showing valid examples of meaningful lesion parts  

- These aim to guide prototypes to focus on clinically relevant lesion characteristics and exclude confounding factors like hair, bubbles, rulers.

- Two prototype supervision losses are introduced:
  - Mask loss uses segmentation masks to minimize activations in insignificant regions
  - Remembering loss maximizes activations for user-provided valid prototype examples

- Experiments compare standard ProtoPNet, ProtoPNet+Mask Loss, and ProtoPNet+Remembering Loss using various CNN backbones.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates interpretable model can match or exceed performance of non-interpretable models and achieve better generalization to new datasets
- Non-expert supervision, even using auto-generated masks, improves prototype quality and model performance 
- Approach ensures prototypes represent meaningful lesion characteristics, enhancing reliability of explanations
- Opens possibilities for expert supervision and assessment of prototype clinical relevance in future work

In summary, the key innovation is showing how additional supervision from non-experts can enhance prototype quality in interpretable models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in skin lesion classification while providing trustworthy explanations.
