# [XAI for Skin Cancer Detection with Prototypes and Non-Expert Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01410)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Skin cancer detection through image analysis is critical, but existing models lack interpretability and transparency, raising concerns among physicians about using black-box models in medicine. 
- Interpretable models like ProtoPNet can provide intuitive visual explanations by comparing parts of the image to learned prototypes. However, classical ProtoPNet often lacks diverse and clinically relevant prototypes, limiting interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an enhanced ProtoPNet model for interpretable melanoma classification using additional supervision techniques to improve prototype quality:
  1) Binary masks obtained from a segmentation network to identify lesion interior/boundary
  2) User-refined prototypes showing valid examples of meaningful lesion parts  

- These aim to guide prototypes to focus on clinically relevant lesion characteristics and exclude confounding factors like hair, bubbles, rulers.

- Two prototype supervision losses are introduced:
  - Mask loss uses segmentation masks to minimize activations in insignificant regions
  - Remembering loss maximizes activations for user-provided valid prototype examples

- Experiments compare standard ProtoPNet, ProtoPNet+Mask Loss, and ProtoPNet+Remembering Loss using various CNN backbones.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates interpretable model can match or exceed performance of non-interpretable models and achieve better generalization to new datasets
- Non-expert supervision, even using auto-generated masks, improves prototype quality and model performance 
- Approach ensures prototypes represent meaningful lesion characteristics, enhancing reliability of explanations
- Opens possibilities for expert supervision and assessment of prototype clinical relevance in future work

In summary, the key innovation is showing how additional supervision from non-experts can enhance prototype quality in interpretable models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in skin lesion classification while providing trustworthy explanations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel interpretable deep learning approach for skin cancer diagnosis that incorporates non-expert supervision through segmentation masks or user-refined prototypes to improve prototype quality and model performance, outperforming non-interpretable models on the ISIC 2019 dataset and demonstrating superior generalization on the PH2 and Derm7pt datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel interpretable deep learning approach for skin cancer detection that incorporates non-expert supervision to improve the quality of prototypes. Specifically:

- They introduce an interpretable model based on ProtoPNet that compares parts of a skin lesion image to learned prototypes to make a diagnosis. 

- They incorporate two forms of non-expert supervision to ensure the prototypes represent clinically relevant regions of skin lesions rather than confounding factors like hair or rulers: 1) using automatic lesion segmentation masks ($L_M$) and 2) allowing users to provide examples of valid prototypes ($L_R$).

- They demonstrate that with non-expert supervision, their interpretable model can match or exceed the performance of non-interpretable models on skin lesion classification, while also generalizing better to new datasets.

- They show qualitatively that the supervision techniques help the model learn better quality prototypes focused on lesions rather than artifacts.

- Their results challenge the notion that interpretable models must sacrifice performance, and suggest even non-expert input can improve prototype quality and model explanations.

In summary, the key contribution is an interpretable skin cancer classification model incorporating non-expert supervision that boosts performance, generalization, and prototype quality compared to prior interpretable and non-interpretable approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes the use of binary masks obtained from an automatic segmentation model as a form of non-expert supervision. What are some potential issues with using automatically generated masks rather than masks curated by a human expert? How could this impact prototype quality?

2. The remembering loss explored in the paper enables non-experts to provide examples of valid prototypes. In what ways could this approach introduce biases based on the non-expert's perceptions? How does this compare to potential biases introduced by automatically generated masks?

3. One of the key findings is that supervision through the mask loss or remembering loss leads to improved generalization capability compared to the baseline model without supervision. What factors enable the supervised models to generalize better to new datasets? 

4. The paper argues that the proposed interpretable model can achieve better performance than non-interpretable models, challenging the notion that interpretability leads to reduced accuracy. Based on the results, do you agree with this conclusion? What additional analyses could strengthen or counter this argument?

5. The projection step involves mapping prototypes onto the closest latent parts of images from the same class. What is the motivation behind this? How does this impact diversity and quality of prototypes? Are there any potential downsides?

6. The paper explores the impact of various CNN backbones like ResNet, EfficientNet and VGGNet. What architectural differences between these networks could explain differences in performance using the proposed approach?

7. The model explanations rely heavily on prototype similarity scores. In what ways could the conceptual meaning of a prototype be unclear or misleading to a human? How could this affect trust in the model?

8. How does the complexity and training process compare between the proposed interpretable model and end-to-end non-interpretable models? What tradeoffs are being made for improved interpretability?

9. The paper demonstrates improved generalization to datasets with distribution shifts. However, what types of distribution shifts could the model still struggle with? When would you expect the model performance to deteriorate?

10. The proposed approach introduces several loss terms like the clustering loss and separation loss. What is the motivation behind each loss component and how do they interact during training? What variations could improve the learning of high-quality prototypes?
