# [A Survey of Personality, Persona, and Profile in Conversational Agents   and Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive review of research on personality, persona, and profile in conversational agents (CAs) and chatbots. The key problem being addressed is how to make CAs more human-like, engaging, and adaptive by endowing them with elements of personality.

The paper first defines the key concepts of personality, persona, and profile, and shows how researchers have modeled these concepts in CAs using various schemes like Big Five personality traits, descriptive sentences, character tropes etc. It then systematically catalogs 21 key datasets that have persona/profile data and have been used to train modern neural CA models. 

Next, the paper summarizes recent models for building CAs with personality. The models are organized by the personality scheme they use, and the techniques they employ to manifest the personality, like conditioning on persona vectors, using memory networks, generative adversarial networks etc. Over 30 models spanning from 2016 onwards are reviewed in detail.

The paper also identifies 9 key research topics related to CA personality like coherent personality modeling, personality in image captions, persona-based dialog evaluation etc. and lists papers for each topic. Related topics like early neural CAs, emotion/empathy in CAs, evaluation of CAs, and reviews of CAs are also touched upon.

In conclusion, the paper provides a structured, comprehensive analysis of the emerging field of personality-adaptive conversational agents. It highlights the rapid progress made on datasets, models and evaluation in incorporating personality into CAs. Some open challenges like better evaluation techniques are identified, and future work around evolving datasets and models is envisaged.

Overall the paper serves as an excellent reference for anyone looking to get up to speed on the current state of personality-based conversational AI research or pursue new work in this area. Its systematic organization and thorough literature analysis surface key papers and opportunities for the field.

The paper presents a systematic survey of personality, persona and profile in conversational agent (chatbot) research. It reviews different methods of specifying personality for chatbots, including schemes like Big-5 and descriptive sentences. It also discusses datasets containing personality data and methods to embody personality in chatbot models. The paper aims to provide a broad overview of recent progress in developing chatbots with personality. Key terms like "personality", "persona", "chatbot", "survey", "review" etc. reflect the main focus and contributions of this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes various methods for specifying personality in conversational agents, such as Big-5, descriptive sentences, and implicit personality schemes. How do these different methods compare in terms of effectiveness for generating convincing personalities? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper discusses prefixing dialogue sentences with descriptive persona sentences as one method to incorporate personality. What are some ways this method could be improved or expanded on? For example, could the descriptive sentences be integrated throughout the dialogue instead of just as a prefix?  

3. For the implicit personality schemes based on analyzing previous dialogues, what are some challenges or limitations of this approach? How reliable is it to extract consistent personality solely from free-form conversational data?

4. The paper mentions the difficulty of properly evaluating personality in conversational agents. What metrics could be developed to better quantify the consistency and plausibility of an agent's personality? 

5. Could the various explicit personality schemes like Big-5 and descriptive sentences be combined together into a single model? What techniques could be used to reconcile and integrate these different schemes?

6. The paper focuses specifically on textual conversational agents. How could the personality methods discussed be adapted to apply to embodied conversational agents with speech, facial expressions, etc?

7. The datasets described have enabled much research on personality. What additional datasets could be created to further push forward progress on personality in conversational agents?

8. The paper mentions historical personas like Freudbot. What unique challenges arise when trying to emulate a specific historical figure's personality versus creating a fictional persona?  

9. Some methods modify word choice or sentence structure to reflect personality. This risks reduced coherence or fluency. How can the tradeoff between personality consistency and linguistic quality be managed?

10. The paper focuses on individual agent personality. Could the methods be extended to also simulate more complex psychological dynamics between agents, like rapport, trust, or conflict? What models would be needed?
