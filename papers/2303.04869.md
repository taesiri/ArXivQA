# [CROSSFIRE: Camera Relocalization On Self-Supervised Features from an   Implicit Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04869)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can neural radiance fields be used as implicit scene representations to enable accurate and robust visual camera relocalization from a single RGB image?

The key points are:

- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) represent scenes as continuous implicit functions that map 3D coordinates to volume density and radiance. This allows photorealistic novel view synthesis. 

- The authors propose to use NeRF as the scene representation for visual localization, where the goal is to estimate the 6DoF camera pose of a query image relative to a known environment.

- Existing methods using NeRFs for localization rely on either pose regression or iterative photometric alignment. However, these have limitations in accuracy, speed, or robustness to changing conditions. 

- The paper introduces local features into the NeRF formulation and trains these jointly with a feature extractor using a self-supervised metric learning objective. This provides dense scene-specific descriptors robust to appearance changes.

- These learned descriptors enable a features matching approach to localization, giving precise 6DoF pose estimates that are fast, accurate, and robust for robotics applications.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that introducing and learning local descriptors in a NeRF model can enable accurate visual localization using features matching, overcoming limitations of prior NeRF-based localization techniques. The paper aims to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing local descriptors in the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) formulation to represent an implicit map of a scene. 

2. Proposing a self-supervised training approach to learn scene-specific descriptors without requiring annotated correspondences. This is done by jointly training a CNN feature extractor and neural renderer using a metric learning loss that leverages the 3D geometry from the radiance field.

3. Using the learned descriptors and renderer for visual localization via iterative dense features matching. This replaces the sparse 3D model used in typical structure-based pipelines with a continuous radiance field that can render descriptors from arbitrary viewpoints.

4. Demonstrating that the proposed scene-specialized descriptors outperform common off-the-shelf feature extractors like SuperPoint as well as other localization methods based on NeRF or sparse point clouds.

5. Showing the approach works for both indoor and outdoor scenes, with robustness to changing lighting conditions.

In summary, the key novelty is in learning repeatable dense descriptors directly from a radiance field in a self-supervised manner, and using this implicit scene representation for precise visual localization via an iterative matching procedure. The results demonstrate improved accuracy over other learning-based localization techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new camera relocalization method that matches dense features rendered from a neural radiance field scene representation to features extracted from a query image to estimate precise 6DoF camera poses, outperforming prior approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other related work on camera localization using implicit neural scene representations:

- The paper focuses specifically on using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) as the scene representation for localizing cameras, whereas much prior work has used other types of implicit representations. NeRFs have become a popular scene representation lately due to their ability to render high-quality novel views.

- The proposed method does not rely on pose regression or direct image alignment/photometric error minimization for localization, unlike many previous methods. Instead, it introduces local descriptors into the NeRF and matches them densely for pose estimation.

- The local descriptors are trained in a self-supervised manner to be invariant to viewing direction and lighting variations. This differs from prior work like FQN that simply stored off-the-shelf descriptors in the model. Learning descriptors specialized for the scene is shown to improve accuracy.

- The dense descriptor matching process is more robust than sparse feature-based localization methods, especially for texture-less regions. It also allows iterative pose refinement which sparse methods cannot.

- The experiments show state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other NeRF-based localization techniques on standard datasets. Especially, it outperforms methods using pretrained descriptors like FQN.

- The proposed approach meets requirements like efficiency and robustness for robotics usage, which direct alignment methods do not satisfy.

Overall, the key novelty is in learning robust dense scene-specific descriptors from a NeRF in a self-supervised way, and using that for accurate 6-DOF pose estimation via iterative dense matching. The implicit representation also allows rendering descriptors for pose refinement from novel viewpoints.
