# [CROSSFIRE: Camera Relocalization On Self-Supervised Features from an   Implicit Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04869)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can neural radiance fields be used as implicit scene representations to enable accurate and robust visual camera relocalization from a single RGB image?

The key points are:

- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) represent scenes as continuous implicit functions that map 3D coordinates to volume density and radiance. This allows photorealistic novel view synthesis. 

- The authors propose to use NeRF as the scene representation for visual localization, where the goal is to estimate the 6DoF camera pose of a query image relative to a known environment.

- Existing methods using NeRFs for localization rely on either pose regression or iterative photometric alignment. However, these have limitations in accuracy, speed, or robustness to changing conditions. 

- The paper introduces local features into the NeRF formulation and trains these jointly with a feature extractor using a self-supervised metric learning objective. This provides dense scene-specific descriptors robust to appearance changes.

- These learned descriptors enable a features matching approach to localization, giving precise 6DoF pose estimates that are fast, accurate, and robust for robotics applications.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that introducing and learning local descriptors in a NeRF model can enable accurate visual localization using features matching, overcoming limitations of prior NeRF-based localization techniques. The paper aims to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing local descriptors in the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) formulation to represent an implicit map of a scene. 

2. Proposing a self-supervised training approach to learn scene-specific descriptors without requiring annotated correspondences. This is done by jointly training a CNN feature extractor and neural renderer using a metric learning loss that leverages the 3D geometry from the radiance field.

3. Using the learned descriptors and renderer for visual localization via iterative dense features matching. This replaces the sparse 3D model used in typical structure-based pipelines with a continuous radiance field that can render descriptors from arbitrary viewpoints.

4. Demonstrating that the proposed scene-specialized descriptors outperform common off-the-shelf feature extractors like SuperPoint as well as other localization methods based on NeRF or sparse point clouds.

5. Showing the approach works for both indoor and outdoor scenes, with robustness to changing lighting conditions.

In summary, the key novelty is in learning repeatable dense descriptors directly from a radiance field in a self-supervised manner, and using this implicit scene representation for precise visual localization via an iterative matching procedure. The results demonstrate improved accuracy over other learning-based localization techniques.
