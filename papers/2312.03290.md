# [Can language agents be alternatives to PPO? A Preliminary Empirical   Study On OpenAI Gym](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03290)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates whether language agents can serve as alternatives to proximal policy optimization (PPO) agents for sequential decision-making tasks, typically addressed by reinforcement learning methods like PPO. The authors introduce TextGym, a platform that transforms OpenAI Gym environments into textual counterparts using their documentation. This allows the performance of language agents to be directly benchmarked against PPO. To enable fair comparisons, they propose a hierarchy of domain knowledge scenarios, from no guidance to expert guidance, to control the knowledge given to agents. They also formulate a unified actor-critic-learner framework to conceptualize different language agents. Moreover, they design a novel "explore-exploit guided language" (EXE) agent tailored for sparse, partially observable tasks. Through experiments across 8 TextGym games, they find language agents can solve certain games like Blackjack and Cartpole but struggle on more complex ones. With environmental interactions, language agents approach expert knowledge performance. Their analysis provides valuable insights into designing more capable language agents and assessing if they could complement or replace PPO on certain sequential decision tasks.
