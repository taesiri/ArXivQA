# [How NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting are Reshaping SLAM: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13255)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental concept in robotics and computer vision, enabling autonomous agents to build maps of unknown environments and simultaneously localize themselves within them. SLAM methods have evolved significantly over the years, transitioning from handcrafted algorithms to deep learning techniques to the latest radiance field-based solutions influenced by advances like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, despite rapid progress, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys focusing specifically on analyzing these latest radiance field-inspired SLAM advances.

Solution:
This paper conducts an extensive survey, reviewing and structurally classifying 58 state-of-the-art radiance field-based SLAM systems published over the past three years. It provides an in-depth analysis, highlighting innovations and limitations of RGB-D, RGB, and LiDAR SLAM methods influenced by implicit neural representations like NeRF and explicit volumetric techniques like 3DGS. 

Contributions:

- Taxonomy organizing SLAM methods into structured categories based on scene representation, tracking approach, optimization strategies etc.

- Thorough overview summarizing all techniques, highlighting input modalities, outputs, and links to project pages/code.

- Comparative benchmarking of systems across tracking, mapping and novel view synthesis on standard datasets like TUM RGB-D and Replica.

- Identification of key advancements and persistent challenges related to scene encoding, catastrophic forgetting, real-time constraints, global optimization, dynamic scene handling and more.

- Analysis of runtime and memory requirements, emphasizing efficiency challenges for real-world viability.

- Discussion of future research directions to overcome limitations and drive progress in radiance field-based SLAM systems.

The survey serves as a comprehensive reference for novices and experts, offering valuable insights into the rapid evolution of SLAM under the influence of neural scene representations.
