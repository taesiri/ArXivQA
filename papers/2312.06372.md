# [Ternary Spike: Learning Ternary Spikes for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06372)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a ternary spike neuron model to mitigate the information loss problem in spiking neural networks (SNNs). The authors first theoretically prove that the binary spike activations used in SNNs have limited representation capacity compared to real-valued activations, resulting in information loss and accuracy drops. To address this, they introduce a ternary spike neuron that can fire -1, 0 or +1 spikes, boosting the information capacity while retaining the event-driven computation and multiplication-free advantages of SNNs. Furthermore, they make the spike amplitude trainable to learn suitable firing levels for different layers given their varying membrane potential distributions. This trainable ternary spike SNN is converted back to a standard one using reparameterization during inference. Evaluations on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate consistent and significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art SNN methods. The simplicity yet effectiveness of the proposed ternary spike neuron in reducing information loss makes it an appealing paradigm for SNNs.
