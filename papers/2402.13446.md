# [Large Language Models for Data Annotation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of using large language models (LLMs) to assist with data annotation for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

It first discusses LLM-based data annotation techniques such as manually engineered prompts and alignment via pairwise feedback. Representative papers are listed in Table 1 along with their methods, technologies used, venues published, and links to code/data.

Next, the paper looks at evaluating the quality of LLM-generated annotations. Table 2 summarizes papers on techniques like human evaluation and active learning for data selection.  

Sections 4-6 detail various strategies for learning with LLM-generated annotations:

- Domain-specific inference and knowledge distillation (Table 3). Methods covered include predicting labels, inferring additional attributes from annotations, chain-of-thought prompting, and input-output prompting between teacher and student models.

- Fine-tuning and prompting techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting (Table 4). Scenarios range from supervised to unsupervised learning.

- Instruction tuning and alignment tuning (Table 5). Tuning strategies leverage human preferences and reinforcement learning to align model behavior.

In summary, the paper provides a structured taxonomy of how LLMs are applied to assist data annotation for NLP tasks. It highlights state-of-the-art techniques across manually engineered prompting, obtaining pairwise feedback, evaluating annotation quality, and learning from generated annotations. The collection of tables serve as a valuable reference guide to the latest published methods and open resources in this emerging area.
