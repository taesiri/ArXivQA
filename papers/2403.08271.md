# [Efficient Prompt Tuning of Large Vision-Language Model for Fine-Grained   Ship Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08271)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Remote sensing fine-grained ship classification (RS-FGSC) is challenging due to high inter-class similarity and limited labeled data availability. Existing methods struggle to generalize to unseen ship categories in real-world scenarios, known as the base-to-new generalization task. This is a critical capability for dealing with new classes where data is restricted.

Method:
The paper proposes a novel prompt tuning approach for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP to enhance base-to-new generalization for RS-FGSC. The key ideas are:

1) A hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design with three levels of ship category descriptions to provide comprehensive textual prompts to the VLM.

2) Incorporating remote sensing ship priors into the model via bias terms learned from small specialized networks. This helps bridge the domain gap between remote sensing images and natural images used to train CLIP. 

3) Learning task-specific prompts to narrow the gap between base and novel classes, enabling fast adaptation.

The method combines multi-granularity textual prompts and remote sensing priors to reduce the domain gap and learn more generalizable features for efficient base-to-new classification.

Contributions:

1) Introduction of the base-to-new generalization problem in RS-FGSC and proposal to utilize VLMs to enhance model generalization.

2) A novel prompt tuning approach with hierarchical prompt design and integration of remote sensing priors for improved generalization.

3) Introduction of the FGSCM-52 dataset, a more comprehensive dataset for RS-FGSC, to advance research.

4) Extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards improving generalization for unseen categories in the RS-FGSC field by developing a specialized prompt tuning approach for VLMs that integrates both multi-granularity textual prompts and remote sensing priors.
