# [FoldToken: Learning Protein Language via Vector Quantization and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09673)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Protein structures (3D points) and sequences (discrete) have contrasting representations, making joint modeling challenging. 
- Existing methods rely on modality-specific architectures like transformers for sequences and GNNs for structures. This limits flexibility and prevents leveraging recent advances like GPT.
- Prior works convert structures to sequences of angles but use continuous angles unsuitable for autoregressive generation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce FoldTokenizer to represent protein sequence-structure as discrete symbols called FoldTokens. This projects residues and structures into a joint discrete space guided by a reconstruction loss.
- FoldTokens form a new protein language unifying sequence-structure into one modality. Apply this to backbone inpainting and antibody design.
- Propose FoldGPT, the first GPT-style model for sequence-structure co-generation using the FoldToken language.
- Enhance the vector quantization module with Soft Conditional Vector Quantization (SoftCVQ) which uses soft attention to query the entire discrete codebook while keeping binary codes. This balances reconstruction and generation.

Main Contributions:
- Innovative idea of a discrete protein language (FoldTokens) jointly representing sequence and structure, enabling GPT-style modeling.
- FoldTokenizer to learn this protein language via improved SoftCVQ vector quantization.
- Demonstration of strong performance on reconstruction and generation tasks using FoldTokens.
- FoldGPT as the first transformer for protein sequence-structure co-generation.
- Substantial improvements to vector quantization with SoftCVQ for both reconstruction and generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces FoldToken, a method to learn a discrete protein language that jointly represents sequence and structure information, enabling the application of language models like GPT for protein sequence-structure co-generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing FoldToken, a framework for learning a discrete protein language that jointly represents protein sequence and structure information. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes FoldTokenizer to transform protein sequence-structure into a sequence of discrete symbols (FoldTokens). This allows unifying sequence and structure into a single modality and applying language models.

2) The paper substantially enhances the vector quantization module with the proposed Soft Conditional Vector Quantization (SoftCVQ) method. SoftCVQ overcomes limitations of prior VQ techniques and achieves good performance on both reconstruction and generation tasks.

3) Leveraging the learned protein language, the paper builds FoldGPT, the first GPT-style model for sequence-structure co-generation. FoldGPT shows promising results on tasks like general backbone inpainting and antibody design compared to existing methods.

In summary, the key innovation is establishing a discrete protein language via FoldTokenizer to bridge protein research with natural language processing, and demonstrating its utility by constructing FoldGPT for generative modeling of proteins. The enhanced SoftCVQ method is also a noteworthy contribution with potential for broader impact.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Protein language - The paper introduces the concept of a "protein language" to jointly represent protein sequence and structure as discrete symbols. This is referred to as FoldToken.

- Vector quantization - Key methods explored in the paper include vanilla VQ, lookup-free VQ (LFQ), soft VQ, soft group VQ, and the proposed soft conditional VQ (SoftCVQ). These methods are used to create the discrete protein language.

- FoldTokenizer - The model that projects protein sequence-structure into a discrete space to create the FoldTokens. It consists of an encoder, quantizer, and decoder.

- Folding angles - The paper represents protein structure as a sequence of folding angles, which are invariant to translation and rotation. This allows a transformer architecture to be used.

- Soft global querying - A key insight is that high reconstruction quality requires soft attention over the entire codebook space during vector quantization.

- FoldGPT - The first GPT-style model introduced for protein sequence-structure co-generation using the learned protein language. It is assessed on tasks like backbone inpainting.

- Antibody design - One application area explored is using FoldGPT for computational antibody design by fine-tuning on an antibody database.
