# [MindAgent: Emergent Gaming Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09971)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How capable are large language models (LLMs) at performing complex multi-agent planning and coordination, and can they collaborate effectively with human players in gaming environments?Specifically, the authors aim to investigate:- The ability of LLMs to schedule and coordinate multiple agents to complete collaborative tasks that require planning, without any task-specific fine-tuning. - Whether LLMs can generalize their multi-agent planning skills, such as coordinating more agents after only seeing examples with fewer agents.- How LLMs can collaborate with human players in gaming scenarios via natural language interaction, without any additional tuning.- The emergent multi-agent planning and coordination skills of LLMs when incorporated into a novel gaming infrastructure called MindAgent.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that large pretrained language models have inherent skills in multi-agent planning and coordination that can be leveraged for collaborative gaming scenarios, even zero-shot without any gaming-specific fine-tuning. The paper explores this hypothesis through the design of a new gaming benchmark and infrastructure, and by evaluating LLMs such as GPT-3 in this interactive gaming environment.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are the main contributions:- The authors introduce a new benchmark called \overcook for evaluating multi-agent scheduling and coordination capabilities. \overcook is a text-based game emulating a virtual kitchen where agents must collaborate to complete cooking orders within a time limit. The modular design allows for easy expansion of tasks, agents, and game engines.- They propose an infrastructure called \mindagent for interactive multi-agent planning with LLMs in \overcook. It demonstrates the zero-shot multi-agent planning capacity of LLMs and incorporates techniques like providing demonstrations, rationale, and feedback to facilitate planning.- The authors conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA in \overcook using \mindagent. The results demonstrate the potential of LLMs as generalist multi-agent planners via their ability to generalize to more agents given fewer examples and adapt to new game domains.- They introduce a new metric called Collaboration Score (\colab) to quantify multi-agent collaboration efficiency in \overcook based on task completion rates across different conditions.- The \mindagent infrastructure is deployed into real gaming scenarios like a VR version of \overcook and Minecraft, showing its effectiveness for LLM-human collaboration and adaptation to different games.In summary, the key contributions are proposing the new \overcook benchmark, \mindagent infrastructure, extensive experiments demonstrating LLMs' emergent multi-agent planning and collaboration skills, the \colab metric, and deployments showing practical gaming applications.
