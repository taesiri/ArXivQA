# [Understanding Deep Networks via Extremal Perturbations and Smooth Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08485)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:

How can we develop a method to identify the most salient parts of an input that are responsible for a deep neural network's output, in a way that is theoretically grounded and interpretable?

The authors aim to improve on prior perturbation-based attribution methods by introducing the concept of "extremal perturbations." Extremal perturbations identify the smallest regions of an input that maximally affect a network's output when perturbed. This provides an interpretable way to analyze which parts of the input are most important for the network's predictions. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- Extremal perturbations can identify important spatial regions in images more effectively than existing perturbation methods.

- By varying the area of extremal perturbations, they can analyze how visual evidence is integrated monotonically in neural networks.

- Extending extremal perturbations to intermediate activations can help understand which channels are most salient for classification in deep networks.

The authors then introduce technical contributions like a new area loss and smooth parametric perturbations to actually compute such extremal perturbations. Overall, the central research aim is to develop extremal perturbations into an interpretable and theoretically grounded framework for attribution analysis of deep neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the concept of "extremal perturbations", which are perturbations that maximally affect a neural network's output while being constrained to a fixed area. This avoids issues with prior work that had to balance multiple terms when optimizing perturbations.

2. It provides an algorithm to compute extremal perturbations using two key innovations:

- A new area loss based on ranking and sorting mask values that can enforce hard area constraints. This is useful beyond computing perturbations.

- A parametric family of smooth perturbations using a smooth max-convolution operator and perturbation pyramid. This removes the need to tune regularization hyperparameters.

3. It extends the perturbations framework from inputs to intermediate activations in a network. This allows perturbations to be used for channel/filter attribution in addition to spatial input attribution. The paper shows how this can help identify salient channels for classification when combined with inversion-based channel visualization techniques.

So in summary, the main contributions are introducing extremal perturbations as a theoretically grounded concept, providing techniques to compute them, and extending perturbations to intermediate layers of neural networks for a new application. The overall goal is to better understand deep networks via analysis of how perturbations affect them.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper introduces extremal perturbations, a new theoretical framework for analyzing neural networks by finding minimal image regions that maximally affect model outputs, and proposes technical innovations like a ranking-based area loss and smooth parametric masks to compute these perturbations without hyperparameters.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces the concept of "extremal perturbations" for analyzing deep neural networks. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work:

- It focuses on finding minimal perturbations that maximally affect a network's output, rather than larger perturbations that may trigger more adversarial effects. This helps reveal more about a model's typical behavior.

- It avoids balancing multiple objectives like model response, mask area, and regularity in a single loss function. Instead, it constrains the area and uses a smooth parametric family of masks, letting it optimize response only.

- It introduces a new ranking-based "area loss" to constrain perturbation size. This acts like a hard constraint and avoids issues with soft penalties.

- It extends perturbation analysis to intermediate layers rather than just the input. This enables new analysis like identifying salient channels via feature inversion. 

- It provides a clean framework and methodology for perturbation analysis compared to prior work like Meaningful Perturbations (Fong & Vedaldi 2017) that mixed several effects in the loss function.

Overall, this paper provides a simpler and cleaner approach to systematically analyze deep networks via constrained and extremal perturbations. The novel area loss and parametric mask family help enable more rigorous perturbation analysis. The extension to intermediate layers also opens up new interpretability applications. It offers a theoretically grounded framework compared to prior heuristic approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing more advanced and scalable optimization techniques for computing extremal perturbations. The authors note that currently their technique is limited to moderate-sized images due to the computational cost of optimizing the perturbations. Developing better optimization methods could allow the approach to scale to larger images.

- Exploring the use of extremal perturbations for analyzing video data and temporal models like RNNs. The current work focuses on image data and CNNs. Extending the framework to the temporal domain could be an interesting direction.

- Applying extremal perturbations to other types of neural network architectures beyond CNNs, such as graph neural networks. This could provide insights into what different network architectures are sensitive to.

- Using extremal perturbations for analyzing adversarial robustness and developing more robust models. The perturbations could potentially serve as a tool for evaluating and improving robustness.

- Developing theoretical understandings of the properties satisfied by extremal perturbations, such as guarantees on their spatial smoothness. This could help formalize their desirable properties.

- Extending the visualization techniques for intermediate layers, such as using extremal perturbations with generative networks to better understand hidden representations.

- Applying the area loss introduced in the paper to other problems that require constraining quantities like network activations. The area loss may have broader applications.

In summary, the main future directions relate to scaling up the approach, extending it to other data modalities and network architectures, developing theoretical understandings, and applying the techniques like the area loss to other problems. Overall, there seem to be many interesting ways the extremal perturbations framework could be expanded in future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of extremal perturbations for analyzing deep neural networks. Extremal perturbations are regions of an input that maximally affect a network's output for a fixed, constrained area. This avoids issues with prior perturbation-based methods that required balancing several terms during optimization. The authors constrain the perturbation's area and choose perturbations from a smooth parametric family, removing all hyperparameter tuning. They analyze how perturbations change with area, demonstrating sensitivity to the network's spatial properties. 

The authors also extend perturbation analysis to intermediate layers, allowing them to identify salient channels for classification. By visualizing salient channels with techniques like feature inversion, they can elucidate model behavior. Additional technical contributions include a ranking-based area loss for stable area constraints and using the smooth max convolution for guaranteed smoothness. The authors release TorchRay, an interpretability library for PyTorch built on these innovations. Overall, this work formalizes the notion of extremal perturbations for improved model interpretation and introduces technical advances to enable their computation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the concept of extremal perturbations for analyzing deep neural networks. Extremal perturbations are defined as regions of an image that, for a given fixed area, maximally affect the activation of a neuron in the network when perturbed. The key innovation is constraining the analysis to perturbations of a certain area, which removes the need to balance several components in the loss function as done in prior work. The area constraint is enforced through a novel ranking-based area loss. The perturbations are made smooth through a parametric family defined by a smooth max-convolution operator and perturbation pyramid. By sweeping over the area, the effect of perturbations as a function of their size can be analyzed, revealing spatial sensitivity properties of the network. The method is extended to perturbing intermediate activations to identify salient channels for classification, which are then visualized using techniques like feature inversion.

- It extends the framework to analyze intermediate activations and identify salient channels for a given class, visualized via feature inversion techniques.

In summary, it provides a principled and optimized framework for attribution based on extremal perturbations, with both input-level and intermediate-layer applications demonstrated. The key innovation is constraining the perturbations to isolate their effect independent of other factors.
