# [BAGEL: Bootstrapping Agents by Guiding Exploration with Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08140)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Language model (LM) agents often fail to generalize to new environments without human demonstrations when following natural language instructions by executing actions. However, collecting expert human demonstrations is laborious and infeasible at scale. 

Proposed Solution:
- This paper presents BAGEL (Bootstrapping Agents by Guiding Exploration with Language), a method to automatically generate synthetic demonstrations without human supervision. 

- BAGEL has two core noisy LM components: (1) An LM labeler which converts a trajectory into a synthetic natural language instruction, (2) A zero-shot LM agent which maps the instruction back into a refined trajectory. 

- It performs iterative round-trips between these components to convert randomly explored trajectories into demonstrations that can be described by natural language.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces an iterative procedure between an LM labeler and LM agent to shift distribution of random trajectories into natural language describable ones.

- Can generate fully synthetic demonstrations with no human supervision or environment reward signal.

- Evaluated on MiniWoB++ and ToolQA environments and shows significant improvements in zero-shot LM agent performance when adapting the agent at test-time with BAGEL demonstrations via retrieval based prompting.

- Reduces execution failures of base LM agent by modeling valid environment dynamics.

In summary, BAGEL is a novel technique to automatically create synthetic demonstrations to improve instruction-following LM agents without any human supervision. The key insight is to leverage LM priors to iteratively shape randomly explored trajectories into natural language grounded ones.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper presents BAGEL, a method to automatically generate synthetic demonstrations to improve instruction following agents in digital environments, without needing human supervision, by iteratively alternating between a trajectory labeler and an instruction following policy to shape randomly explored trajectories into plausible instruction-trajectory pairs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting BAGEL (Bootstrapping Agents by Guiding Exploration with Language), a method for automatically generating synthetic demonstrations to train instruction following agents, without requiring human supervision or access to reward signals. 

Specifically, BAGEL converts a seed set of randomly explored trajectories or synthetic instructions into demonstrations via round-trips between two noisy LM components - an LM labeler and a zero-shot LM agent. By iteratively performing these round-trips, BAGEL shifts the distribution of trajectories towards those that are well-described by natural language.

The paper then shows that using the BAGEL-generated synthetic demonstrations as in-context examples during test time leads to significant improvements in performance (2-13% absolute) on instruction following tasks in two domains - MiniWoB++ and ToolQA - compared to a zero-shot LM baseline.

The paper presents a method called BAGEL (Bootstrapping Agents by Guiding Exploration with Language) to automatically generate synthetic demonstrations for training LM agents, without requiring human supervision. It uses an iterative procedure between a zero-shot LM agent and an LM labeler to convert randomly explored trajectories or synthetic instructions into refined demonstrations. These are then used at test time to adapt the base LM agent via in-context learning with retrieved relevant demonstrations. Experiments on MiniWob++ and ToolQA environments demonstrate significant improvements in performance compared to a zero-shot baseline.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does BAGEL balance exploiting LM priors to guide exploration while still ensuring diversity of demonstrations? Does it risk converging to a narrow distribution of trajectories that may not generalize well?

2. The paper mentions improving diversity of seed trajectories as an area for further work. What specific techniques could help increase diversity during the initial exploration phase?

3. BAGEL relies on the quality of the trajectory labeler and instruction following policy. How sensitive is overall performance to the accuracy of each of these components? 

4. The demonstration filter plays an important role in determining when to add a trajectory-instruction pair to the demonstrations. What other criteria beyond just executing the trajectory could improve filtering?

5. How does BAGEL compare to more traditional goal relabeling techniques from hindsight experience replay? What are the tradeoffs?

6. Could ideas from self-supervised learning be used to improve the diversity or quality of unlabeled demonstrations generated via exploration?

7. The instruction generator uses only the first observation - could conditioning it also on possible actions improve quality of initial instructions and reduce mismatch compared to test time instructions? 

8. What modifications need to be made for BAGEL to work in interactive settings where instructions can change over the course of a trajectory?

9. Error analysis reveals issues with long horizon planning - could hierarchical planning or alternatives to autoregressive decoding mitigate this?

10. How well does BAGEL scale to much more complex environments in terms of exploration tractability and quality of demonstrations? Are there optimizations or adjustments needed to make it scalable?
