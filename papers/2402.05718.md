# [REMEDI: Corrective Transformations for Improved Neural Entropy   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Information theoretic quantities like entropy, mutual information etc play a central role in machine learning. However, estimating these quantities accurately becomes challenging in high dimensions. Existing methods like kernel density estimators and Gaussian mixture models struggle due to the curse of dimensionality. This limits the applicability of information theoretic learning frameworks.

Proposed Solution (REMEDI): 
The paper proposes a new method called REMEDI that combines a flexible base distribution (like Gaussian mixture) with a neural correction function to get tight entropy estimates. 

The base distribution is first optimized to minimize the cross-entropy loss. This makes it get close to the true distribution. Then a neural network is trained using the Donsker-Varadhan representation to estimate the deviation of the base distribution from the true distribution. Combining the cross-entropy of the base distribution and the Donsker-Varadhan term gives an estimate much closer to the true entropy.

The method can work with any base distribution with tractable density and sampling. The paper shows it works well with a Gaussian mixture model base.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the REMEDI framework for accurate entropy estimation by combining strengths of recent advances 

- Shows theoretical consistency of the estimator under weaker assumptions than previous work

- Demonstrates limitations of current state-of-the-art in moderate dimensions

- Shows improved accuracy over other methods on benchmark synthetic and real datasets

- Discusses application to Information Bottleneck method where it achieves better accuracy than other MI estimators

- Explores connection with generative modeling via rejection sampling and Langevin dynamics

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in entropy estimation and information-theoretic learning with improved theoretical and practical results over state-of-the-art approaches.
