# [Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Modern recommender systems face challenges related to unfairness and popularity bias. Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems also suffer from these issues, as their normalization and aggregation processes tend to over-recommend popular items while ignoring long-tail items. This causes unfairness towards items and item providers.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a fair GNN-based recommender system called HetroFair to improve item-side fairness. It has two main components:

1) Fairness-aware attention: Incorporates dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to reduce the impact of node degrees on the embeddings. This prevents over-enlargement of popular item embeddings. 

2) Heterophily feature weighting: Assigns distinct weights to different features of items during aggregation, based on the heterophily property where dissimilar nodes tend to connect. This captures feature diversity effectively.

Main Contributions:

- Theoretically analyzes the effect of message normalization in GNN recommendation systems on popularity bias

- Designs a fairness-aware attention mechanism and extends it to feature-level using heterophily property of graphs

- Proposes the HetroFair model that uses both techniques to generate fair user and item embeddings

- Conducts extensive experiments on 6 datasets to demonstrate HetroFair's superiority over state-of-the-art in improving both accuracy and fairness

- Shows the impact of different components through ablation studies and hyperparameter analysis

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions regarding item-side fairness in GNN recommendation systems, with both algorithmic proposals and empirical validation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.
