# [Attention-based Dynamic Multilayer Graph Neural Networks for Loan   Default Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of credit risk assessment using network science. Traditionally, credit scoring models treat borrowers as independent entities. However, correlations between borrowers exist and can propagate risk across a network. Prior work has used network data to demonstrate this, but considers either static or single layer networks. Real-world networks are often dynamic and multilayer. Capturing the evolution of connections in such networks could improve credit scoring models.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Dynamic Multilayer Graph Neural Network (DYMGNN) to model credit risk across time by explicitly incorporating default correlations between borrowers. The model combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to create a sequence of snapshots of a multilayer network. GNNs are used to capture topological dependencies within a snapshot. RNNs capture dependencies between snapshots across time steps. An attention mechanism is also introduced to assign timestamps different importance.

Contributions:
1) A novel DYMGNN approach for node classification in multilayer dynamic networks.

2) An application of DYMGNN for mortgage loan default prediction using a dataset from Freddie Mac. Two single layer networks are created based on borrower location and lending company. A double layer network combines both. 

3) Empirical demonstration that the proposed GAT-LSTM-ATT model outperforms baselines. It exploits multilayer effects and network dynamics better. Performance gains are especially notable over static network models, showing the value of capturing temporal changes.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and applied contributions in developing a deep learning architecture for credit scoring that harnesses the additional predictive signal present in multilayer dynamic networks. The mortgage loan case study provides evidence this can enhance default models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel attention-based dynamic multilayer graph neural network approach for credit risk assessment that outperforms traditional models by exploiting topological and temporal dependencies in evolving borrower connections derived from mortgage data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach called Dynamic Multilayer Graph Neural Networks (DYMGNN) for credit risk assessment. Specifically, the paper:

1) Presents a new method for node classification in dynamic multilayer networks by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This allows capturing both the topological and temporal dependencies in multilayer network data.

2) Applies the proposed DYMGNN method to credit risk modelling using mortgage loan default prediction as an example. This is done by constructing single layer and double layer dynamic networks from mortgage data reflecting different borrower connections over time. 

3) Shows through experiments that the best performing model, GAT-LSTM-ATT applied on the double layer network, outperforms baseline models and traditional credit risk methods by effectively utilizing the dynamic multilayer network structure.

4) Provides insights into the model interpretation using Shapley values and attention scores, shedding light on the relative importance of different features and timestamps.

In summary, the key innovation is developing a unified deep learning approach called DYMGNN that leverages dynamic multilayer networks to advance predictive modelling for credit scoring.
