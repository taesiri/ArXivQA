# [PySCIPOpt-ML: Embedding Trained Machine Learning Models into   Mixed-Integer Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08074)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces PySCIPOpt-ML, an open-source Python package that allows users to automatically formulate trained machine learning (ML) models as mixed-integer programming (MIP) constraints. It interfaces popular ML frameworks like Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and PyTorch with the MIP solver SCIP, supporting a variety of ML models including neural networks, regression, trees, random forests, etc. The package uses MIP formulations that prioritize numerical stability, like SOS1 constraints for ReLU activations. It also introduces SurrogateLib, a library of semi-realistic MIP instances with embedded ML constraints based on real-world data. These act as test cases, with instance generators provided that create problems of adjustable complexity. Overall, PySCIPOpt-ML conveniently integrates ML predictors into MIPs to leverage ML approximations of complex real-world systems within mathematical optimization. The code, documentation, and instance library aim to make this embedding of ML into optimization problems accessible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces PySCIPOpt-ML, a Python package for automatically formulating trained machine learning models as mixed-integer programming constraints to be embedded in optimization problems solved by SCIP.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of the Python package PySCIPOpt-ML, which directly interfaces various ML frameworks with the open-source solver SCIP to allow easy integration of ML constraints into MIPs.

2. The use of MIP formulations that prioritize numerical stability, especially when solving with SCIP. This includes a SOS1-based formulation for ReLU activation functions in neural networks.

3. The introduction of a new library of MIP instances with embedded ML constraints called SurrogateLIB, as well as the corresponding instance generators. This provides a set of homogeneous, semi-realistic MIP instances for the community.
