# [Nature-Inspired Local Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05959)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current machine learning methods rely on large datasets for training, unlike biological learning which can learn from online processing of environmental information. 
- Biological learning processes have spatiotemporal locality, whereas commonly used machine learning algorithms like backpropagation lack such locality.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate learning as an optimal control problem and derive "laws of learning" using principles from theoretical physics that take the form of Hamiltonian equations. 
- Show that in the limit of infinite propagation speed, the discrete algorithmic interpretation yields backpropagation, thus establishing a link with spatiotemporal locality.
- Propose methods to approximate the solution of the Hamiltonian boundary value problem using only initial conditions, enabling online processing. Specifically, introduce "Hamiltonian Sign Flip" strategy that stabilizes learning.

Main Contributions:  
- Provides a physics-inspired, pre-algorithmic framework for deriving neural learning rules with spatiotemporal locality, overcoming limitations of backpropagation.
- Shows that backpropagation arises as a limit case of the proposed learning laws when propagation speed tends to infinity. Thus offers insights into biological plausibility of backpropagation.  
- Introduces Hamiltonian Sign Flip method to enable online learning under the proposed framework by approximating solutions using just initial conditions instead of boundary conditions.
- Overall, opens up possibilities for developing radically new machine learning approaches incorporating spatiotemporal locality and online information processing, inspired by natural learning.

In summary, the paper develops a principled information-processing view of learning anchored in physics concepts, that reconciles biologically-inspired locality with popular machine learning algorithms. The theory and stabilization methods proposed constitute the main contributions towards enabling alternate local and online learning schemes.
