# [GLiDR: Topologically Regularized Graph Generative Network for Sparse   LiDAR Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00068)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sparse LiDAR point clouds cause loss of detail of static structures and reduce density of static points available for navigation. This can be detrimental for navigation in autonomous systems. 
- Existing solutions for point cloud completion fail to identify and preserve global shape and topology of LiDAR scans, leading to sub-optimal completion.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent LiDAR scan as graph to learn global shape properties. Use message passing between nodes to propagate information.
- Use 0-dimensional Persistent Homology (PH) to capture topology of static structures in form of a "backbone". This acts as constraint for generating new points.
- Propose GLiDR - a Graph Generative Network with PH constraints to augment new static points along the backbone while preserving topology.

Main Contributions:
- Novel graph-based network with PH topological constraints for sparse LiDAR completion
- Demonstrate superior performance over baselines in augmenting static structures for dense and 32x sparse LiDAR
- Significantly improve navigation performance over segmentation-assisted and devoid methods
- Qualitative demonstration of accurately segmenting dynamic objects without using segmentation labels
- Overall, an effective topology-aware approach to handle sparsity in LiDAR for critical navigation tasks

The key idea is to leverage PH constraints on a graph representation of LiDAR to explicitly focus on preserving global topology when generating new static points. This allows accurately augmenting structures visible in the scan as well as those occluded by dynamic objects.
