# [An Empirical Categorization of Prompting Techniques for Large Language   Models: A Practitioner's Guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14837)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a framework for categorizing prompting techniques used with large language models (LLMs). The motivation is that the rapid advancement of conversational LLMs like ChatGPT has sparked significant interest in prompt engineering, but the plethora of techniques makes it challenging for practitioners to navigate. 

The paper proposes a categorization of prompting techniques into 7 categories:

1. Logical and Sequential Processing: Methods to break down complex reasoning into manageable steps, improving problem-solving abilities. Examples are chain-of-thought and tree/graph-of-thoughts prompting.

2. Contextual Understanding and Memory: Techniques to maintain context over long conversations by recalling previous interactions. This includes in-context, multi-personas, conversational, and Socratic prompting.  

3. Specificity and Targeting: Methods to elicit precise, goal-oriented responses by distinguishing between information types. Examples are show-me vs tell-me, target-your-response, and contrastive prompting.

4. Meta-Cognition and Self-Reflection: Techniques for introspective prompting and code generation to enhance assistive capabilities. This covers self-reflection, meta-prompting, anticipatory prompting, and prompt-to-code.

5. Directional and Feedback: Guiding the LLM towards specific tasks and refining responses based on user feedback. Examples are responsive feedback, directional stimulus, and ambiguous prompting.

6. Multimodal and Cross-Disciplinary: Integrating diverse inputs and knowledge domains to increase versatility. This includes multimodal, cross-disciplinary, historical context, visual, and modular prompting. 

7. Creative and Generative: Eliciting creative content like stories and poems. Methods include flipped interaction, grammar correction, and constrained vocabulary prompting.

For each category, the paper provides an overview, examples from literature, and practical real-world illustrations. The main contribution is a structured framework for understanding, selecting and applying prompting techniques across disciplines. This aims to simplify prompt engineering and enable more effective LLM utilization in diverse applications.
