# [MIMIC: Masked Image Modeling with Image Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15128)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective method to curate large-scale multi-view image datasets for self-supervised pretraining of vision models, especially for dense prediction tasks like depth estimation and semantic segmentation?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Multi-view image datasets with varying perspectives of the same scenes can enable models to learn useful representations of 3D structure. This could benefit dense prediction tasks that require reasoning about 3D geometry.2) Existing multi-view datasets rely on 3D annotations like meshes, point clouds, etc. which limit scalability. The authors propose a method to generate multi-view datasets without needing such 3D supervision. 3) Larger dataset scale leads to better self-supervised pretraining and downstream task performance. Their proposed data curation methodology can scale arbitrarily to generate even bigger datasets.4) Self-supervised pretraining on their proposed multi-view dataset outperforms existing datasets like ImageNet and MV-Habitat on multiple dense prediction tasks.So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a scalable multi-view dataset curation methodology for self-supervised pretraining, and the key hypotheses are around its advantages over existing datasets and pretraining methods.
