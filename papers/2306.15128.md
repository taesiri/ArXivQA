# [MIMIC: Masked Image Modeling with Image Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15128)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective method to curate large-scale multi-view image datasets for self-supervised pretraining of vision models, especially for dense prediction tasks like depth estimation and semantic segmentation?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Multi-view image datasets with varying perspectives of the same scenes can enable models to learn useful representations of 3D structure. This could benefit dense prediction tasks that require reasoning about 3D geometry.2) Existing multi-view datasets rely on 3D annotations like meshes, point clouds, etc. which limit scalability. The authors propose a method to generate multi-view datasets without needing such 3D supervision. 3) Larger dataset scale leads to better self-supervised pretraining and downstream task performance. Their proposed data curation methodology can scale arbitrarily to generate even bigger datasets.4) Self-supervised pretraining on their proposed multi-view dataset outperforms existing datasets like ImageNet and MV-Habitat on multiple dense prediction tasks.So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a scalable multi-view dataset curation methodology for self-supervised pretraining, and the key hypotheses are around its advantages over existing datasets and pretraining methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose MIMIC, a novel data curation method to generate large-scale multi-view image datasets for self-supervised learning without requiring any 3D annotations like meshes or camera parameters. This allows scaling up multi-view datasets more easily.2. Using MIMIC, the authors curate two multi-view datasets - MIMIC-1M with 1.3M image pairs and MIMIC-3M with 3.1M image pairs, sourced from videos and synthetic 3D environments.3. The authors train masked image modeling methods like MAE and CroCo on MIMIC datasets and evaluate on downstream tasks. They show representations trained on MIMIC-3M outperform those trained on other datasets like ImageNet-1K and MV-Habitat on tasks like depth estimation, semantic segmentation, surface normals prediction, etc.4. The authors demonstrate larger pretraining datasets, longer pretraining and their curation method's ability to scale leads to performance gains on downstream tasks.5. The authors show MIMIC representations perform better on few-shot fine-tuning and on reconstruction quality compared to other datasets.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a scalable multi-view data curation approach MIMIC and using it to generate large datasets to train representations that outperform prior datasets on several dense prediction tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes MIMIC, a new method to generate large-scale multi-view image datasets from videos and 3D environments using traditional computer vision techniques like SIFT and homography, and shows these datasets can effectively train masked image modeling objectives like MAE and CroCo for self-supervised representation learning on dense prediction tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related research:- This paper focuses on curating large-scale multi-view image datasets for self-supervised representation learning for dense prediction tasks like depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Other works like MAE and BEiT focus more on image classification tasks. - The proposed MIMIC method for dataset curation uses traditional computer vision techniques like SIFT, RANSAC, and homographies to mine correspondences between image pairs. This allows creating datasets without 3D annotations. In contrast, the CroCo paper relied on 3D meshes and camera poses to generate its dataset.- The MIMIC dataset contains both real-world (videos, street scenes) and synthetic (indoor scenes) data sources. Many prior works like SimCLR and MoCo focused only on ImageNet or other datasets of natural images. Using more diverse data could help transfer better to downstream tasks.- For self-supervised pretraining, this paper trains Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and compares to CroCo. Many other papers have used contrastive learning objectives like in SimCLR and MoCo. The reconstruction-based objectives may capture more detailed spatial information.- This paper shows strong results on depth, segmentation, normals, and pose tasks by pretraining on the MIMIC dataset. Other works like CP and LOCA also aim to improve representation learning for dense tasks but use different pretraining objectives and datasets. - The proposed approach does not make assumptions about metadata like camera parameters. This makes the dataset curation approach more scalable. Other datasets like KITTI require specialized capture setups.In summary, this paper innovates on scalable dataset curation using classical vision techniques and uses the data to pretrain representations specifically targeted for dense prediction tasks, outperforming prior datasets and methods. The approach is generic and could enable creating even larger and more diverse multi-view datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Scaling up experiments with more compute and larger models. The authors mention their experiments are limited by compute budget and model size. So scaling up could lead to further improvements.- Pretraining on dynamic video data with moving objects. The authors note their dataset is primarily static scenes and evaluating on dynamic video data could be interesting future work.- Designing new pretext tasks and objectives tailored to the image pairs curated by their method. The flexibility of their data curation approach lends itself to designing novel pretext tasks.- Evaluating on more diverse downstream tasks beyond the ones explored in the paper. The authors suggest their method could benefit other tasks like optical flow, video prediction, etc.- Further scaling up the dataset size since their data curation approach can easily produce even larger datasets. The authors note larger datasets led to performance gains in their experiments.- Addressing limitations around inclusion of more object-centric data. The authors note their dataset currently has limited object data and evaluating generalization to more object-centric tasks could be useful.In summary, the main future directions are around scaling up in terms of model size, dataset size, diversity of data, and evaluating on more tasks to further demonstrate the capabilities enabled by their proposed data curation method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces MIMIC (Masked Image Modeling with Image Correspondences), a method to curate large-scale datasets for self-supervised pretraining aimed at dense computer vision tasks like depth estimation and semantic segmentation. The key idea is to leverage traditional computer vision techniques like SIFT, RANSAC, and homography estimation to extract corresponding patches between frame pairs in videos and renderings of 3D scenes. This allows generating multi-view image pairs at scale without needing any 3D annotations. Using this approach, the authors generate two datasets - MIMIC-1M with 1.3M pairs and MIMIC-3M with 3.1M pairs. They then train masked image modeling objectives like MAE and CroCo on these datasets and evaluate the representations on downstream tasks. Key findings are: 1) MIMIC-3M outperforms existing datasets like ImageNet-1K and MV-Habitat on tasks like depth, segmentation, normals, pose. 2) More pretraining data and epochs continue to improve performance. 3) MIMIC benefits low-shot transfer. 4) The pretraining reconstructions are higher quality. Overall, the work provides an effective method to generate pretraining datasets for dense prediction without needing 3D supervision.
