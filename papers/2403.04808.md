# [WaterMax: breaking the LLM watermark detectability-robustness-quality   trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate convincing human-like text, raising risks of misuse. Tracing text origins to LLMs is critical for accountability.
- Passive forensic methods have limitations in performance and control of false alarms. Active watermarking methods degrade text quality or robustness.  

Proposed Solution - WaterMax:
- New watermarking scheme that lets LLM generate multiple candidate texts per prompt and selects the one with lowest p-value from a detection algorithm.
- Does not modify LLM components like weights, logits, temperature or sampling. Improves text quality and watermark detectability.
- Works by exploring possible texts through iterative generation of small chunks with multiple drafts per chunk. Optimizes based on chunk p-values.  

Key Contributions:
- WaterMax significantly improves text quality over prior watermarking schemes for the same detectability.
- Provides theoretical analysis on false positive and true positive rates, including under attack.
- Robust detection aggregates scores over chunks instead of per token, enabling control of false alarms and tamper resistance.  
- Experiments validate performance, showing WaterMax outpaces prior schemes on detectability, text quality and robustness over a suite of benchmarks.
- Achieves high quality and detectability by better utilizing text entropy through chunks over standard per-token approaches.

In summary, the paper presents WaterMax, a novel watermarking approach for LLMs that achieves a superior combination of text quality, detectability and robustness compared to prior schemes. This is enabled by a new technique of iterative chunk-based generation and selection optimized based on p-values.
