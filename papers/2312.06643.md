# [Gaze Detection and Analysis for Initiating Joint Activity in Industrial   Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06643)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a wizard-of-oz study analyzing the natural gaze behavior of 37 participants working collaboratively with a cobot on an assembly task. The goal is to examine if gaze can serve as a trigger for initiating joint activities in human-robot collaborations, inspired by gaze behaviors commonly used in human-human interactions. Using an attention recognition model, the authors identify when participants look at the cobot. They find that in most cases (84.88%), the joint activity where the human and robot manipulate an object together is preceded by the human gazing at the cobot. Furthermore, gazes towards the cobot tend to occur around the time of the joint activity rather than at random times. This suggests humans use gaze as a natural social cue when collaborating with robots similarly to human collaborators. The feasibility of using gaze analysis to enhance operator experience in industrial settings by adapting cobot behavior is discussed, though further real-world validation is still needed. Overall, this is the first study analyzing natural gaze behavior of humans performing joint activities with cobots in collaborative assembly.
