# [A Comparative Analysis of Microrings Based Incoherent Photonic GEMM   Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03149)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior works have proposed various microwave photonic integrated circuit (PIC) based accelerators for accelerating GEMM operations in deep neural networks. These accelerators use microring resonators (MRRs) to implement analog dot product units (DPUs).  
- The DPUs manipulate optical signals in 5 ways: splitting, aggregation, modulation, weighting, and summation. The order in which these manipulations are done impacts optical crosstalk and losses, which affects the maximum supported DPU size N and degree of parallelism M.
- No prior work has analyzed the impact of different organizations of these manipulation blocks on the performance of MRR-based accelerators. 

Proposed Solution:
- Classify prior MRR-based DPU organizations into 3 types based on order of manipulations: 
    1) ASMW: Aggregation, Splitting, Modulation, Weighting
    2) MASW: Modulation, Aggregation, Splitting, Weighting 
    3) SMWA: Splitting, Modulation, Weighting, Aggregation
- Perform circuit-level analysis to compare optical crosstalk and losses in different organizations
- Evaluate maximum supported N and M for different organizations through modeling and analysis
- Implement system-level simulation of ASMW, MASW, and SMWA organizations and compare their throughput, energy efficiency and area efficiency

Key Contributions:
- First comparative analysis of impact of MRR-based DPU organizations on optical crosstalk, losses and performance
- Identified that SMWA organization has lowest optical crosstalk and losses, allowing it to support larger N and M
- Evaluation shows SMWA organization provides up to 4.4x higher throughput, 5x better energy efficiency and 5.2x improved area-energy efficiency compared to ASMW and MASW organizations
- Established importance of organizing manipulation blocks in MRR-based accelerators to minimize optical crosstalk and losses for highest performance

The key insight is that the order of optical signal manipulations impacts crosstalk and losses, which significantly affects the performance of MRR-based accelerators. Careful organization of manipulation blocks is needed to maximize achievable parallelism and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper analyzes different organizations of microring resonator-based optical accelerators for matrix multiplication, shows that the Splitting-Modulation-Weighting-Aggregation (SMWA) organization achieves the best throughput, energy efficiency, and area efficiency due to reduced optical crosstalk and losses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It classifies prior incoherent MRR-based GEMM accelerators into three categories (MASW, ASMW, and SMWA) based on the organization of their optical signal manipulation blocks. 

2) It performs a comparative analysis of these three organizations in terms of the optical crosstalk noise and losses they incur, and how that impacts their scalability and achievable levels of processing parallelism.

3) It evaluates these three organizations at a system level by modeling and simulating them, and compares their performance in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, and area efficiency for inferences of four CNN models. 

The key finding is that the SMWA organization, which has the splitting block first followed by modulation and weighting blocks, outperforms the other two organizations by significant margins in terms of throughput (up to 4.4x), energy efficiency (up to 5x) and area efficiency (up to 5.2x). This is because the SMWA organization incurs the least optical crosstalk noise and losses, allowing it to achieve greater scalability and higher parallelism.

In summary, the paper makes a key contribution in terms of classifying and systematically analyzing different organizations of optical manipulation blocks in MRR-based accelerators, evaluating their impact on performance through modeling, and identifying the SMWA organization as the superior performer.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three different organizations for microring resonator (MRR)-based optical dot product units (DPUs) - ASMW, MASW, and SMWA. What are the key differences in how these organizations manipulate and route optical signals within the DPU?

2. What are the different types of optical crosstalk effects and losses that can occur in MRR-based DPUs? How does the organization of the DPU impact which of these effects will be present or absent?

3. The paper performs a scalability analysis to determine the maximum achievable DPU size N for different organizations. Walk through the key equations and parameters involved in this analysis. What factors limit the scalability?

4. The SMWA organization is found to achieve much higher maximum DPU sizes than ASMW and MASW. What are the architectural benefits of SMWA that enable this increased scalability? 

5. The paper evaluates system-level performance of accelerators using different DPU organizations in terms of throughput, energy efficiency and area efficiency. Why does the SMWA organization provide significant gains in these metrics compared to ASMW and MASW?

6. How is the degree of parallelism in terms of fan-in N and fan-out M related to throughput and efficiency? Why does higher N and M in SMWA lead to gains?

7. The paper assumes the same optical power budget for all organizations during evaluation. How would the results change if optical power was optimized separately for each organization?

8. The impact of different bit precisions and data rates on the scalability is analyzed. How do these parameters interact with the power budget to limit N?

9. Microring weight banks are used within DPUs to perform input-weight multiplication. What is cross-weight penalty and how can it be minimized through careful device design?

10. If fabricated, what test setup could be used to experimentally validate the differences in crosstalk and losses between the ASMW, MASW and SMWA organizations?
