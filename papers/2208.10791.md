# [Extending nnU-Net is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10791)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we optimize the nnU-Net segmentation pipeline to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the multi-organ segmentation tasks in the AMOS2022 challenge?Specifically, the paper investigates modifications to nnU-Net's default configuration to maximize segmentation accuracy on the dataset provided by the AMOS2022 challenge, which has 15 target organ labels across MRI and CT scans. The key elements explored are:- Adjusting nnU-Net hyperparameters like patch size, batch size, target spacing, etc.- Using residual connections in the encoder of the U-Net architecture. - Developing a custom post-processing strategy tailored to common errors.- Model ensembling to combine multiple optimized nnU-Net configurations.Through these focused optimizations of nnU-Net, the authors aim to demonstrate improved multi-organ segmentation accuracy on the AMOS2022 tasks compared to the default nnU-Net pipeline.
