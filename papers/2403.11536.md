# [OCR is All you need: Importing Multi-Modality into Image-based Defect   Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic optical inspection (AOI) is vital for defect detection in manufacturing, but faces challenges like limited data, variability across domains, and sensitivity to imaging conditions. 
- Traditional AOI fails to leverage rich mechanism-parameter data that could aid classification.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce OANet, an external modality-guided data mining framework using optical character recognition (OCR) to extract statistical image features as a second modality. 
- Align OCR-extracted external features with image features from a CNN in a modality-aware model for refined fusion.
- Further refine fused features and introduce gating function to optimize combination and enhance inference.

Main Contributions:
1. Propose single-modality-aware multimodal learning that extracts OCR stats from images to boost AOI performance without needing multi-modality input.
2. Pioneering OCR-driven feature extraction converts printed image data into a format suitable for training single-modality-aware models. 
3. Advanced feature alignment before fusion ensures harmonious blending of distinct modality features. Accompanying gating function and refinement boost robustness, especially when OCR data is compromised.

Experimental evaluations on ASE Corp data demonstrate markedly improved recall rates for defect detection and high robustness against anomalies in either modality. The proposed innovations significantly advance AOI and multimodal defect detection capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel defect detection framework, OANet, that utilizes optical character recognition to extract statistical features from images as a second modality to enhance performance by aligning these external modality features with image features encoded by a convolutional neural network for optimal fusion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing a single-modality-aware multimodal learning framework for automated optical inspection (AOI) and defect detection that extracts and utilizes features from external modalities like text and statistics embedded in images. This avoids relying on traditional multimodal inputs that may be inaccessible.

2. Introducing an OCR-driven feature extraction methodology to obtain external modality data from images and convert it into formats suitable for training single-modality-aware multimodal models.

3. Presenting an enhanced feature fusion mechanism involving alignment of features before fusion, along with a gating function and feature refinement strategy to optimize combining of features from distinct modalities.

4. Empirically demonstrating on an ASE Corporation dataset that the proposed OANet (Ocr-Aoi-Net) framework boosts recall rates substantially for defect detection while maintaining robustness even with imperfect OCR or corrupted modality data.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a way to effectively utilize single-modality external features extracted via OCR from AOI images to improve defect detection, overcoming limitations of inaccessible multimodal data.
