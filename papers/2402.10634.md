# [Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal   Downsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10634)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of spatiotemporal forecasting of time series collected by sensor networks. In particular, it focuses on the challenging scenario where the input time series contain missing values, especially in large contiguous blocks across both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Existing methods like spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) fail to capture the underlying dynamics when missing values are not sporadic but occur in clusters, as they rely solely on localized processing conditioned on recent observations.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a deep learning architecture based on hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling to handle varying patterns of missing data. The key idea is to learn representations of the input data at multiple temporal and spatial scales. This is achieved by:

1) Temporal downsampling within recurrent layers to expand the temporal receptive field and isolate dynamics at different timescales. 

2) Graph pooling across spatial message passing layers to gradually distill global structure information.

The model computes an attention-based weighting over this pool of multi-scale representations conditioned on the input data and missing value patterns. The weighted combination is then used to make the final forecasts.

Main Contributions:

- Novel architecture for spatiotemporal forecasting combining convolutional, recurrent, and graph neural network modules with downsampling.

- Interpretable attention mechanism over hierarchical representations to handle heterogeneous missing data distributions.

- Strong performance against state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world forecasting tasks, especially in presence of large contiguous blocks of missing values.

- Introduction of new datasets with multivariate time series and missing values simulated according to patterns occurring in sensor networks.

In summary, the paper puts forth an efficient, accurate and interpretable approach for forecasting problems involving spatial, temporal and missing data dimensions. The high flexibility in modeling dependencies at multiple scales makes it an appealing solution for sensor network analytics.
