# [Classifying Clustering Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5270)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can the mathematical concept of functoriality be used to classify and study clustering algorithms?The key points are:- Clustering algorithms take as input a dataset (finite metric space) and produce a clustering (partition or hierarchy) as output. - The authors propose viewing clustering algorithms as functors - maps between categories of input data and output clusterings that respect the morphisms (structure-preserving maps) of those categories.- They define categories of finite metric spaces with different choices of morphisms (isometries, injections, general maps) that impose varying constraints. More morphisms means more stringent constraints on functorial clustering algorithms.- Functoriality provides a framework to classify clustering algorithms based on what morphisms they respect. The authors prove results characterizing excisive (idempotent on clusters) and representable (defined by allowed test metric spaces) functors.- They show single linkage is the unique functorial clustering scheme on the category of general maps, while larger classes exist on the categories of injections or isometries. These include density-sensitive schemes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that functoriality gives a useful lens to classify and understand clustering algorithms based on what relations between datasets they preserve. The results bear this out, giving both impossibility and constructive classification theorems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a framework based on functoriality to classify and study clustering algorithms. The key ideas are:- Modeling clustering algorithms as functors between categories of input metric spaces and output clusterings. This allows imposing natural conditions on clustering algorithms such as consistency under morphisms between input spaces. - Studying functoriality under different categories of metric space morphisms (isometries, injections, distance non-increasing maps) leads to different classes of clustering algorithms. More restrictive morphism classes give more constraints on functorial algorithms.- Characterizing excisive clustering functors, which don't further split clusters once formed, as representable functors. This provides an explicit generative model. - Obtaining classifications and (non-)uniqueness theorems for functorial clustering algorithms under different morphism categories. Single linkage is the unique functorial clustering under distance non-increasing morphisms.- Constructing broader classes of functorial algorithms, sensitive to density, using injection morphisms. These include analogues of clique clustering algorithms.So in summary, the functorial framework provides a way to systematically study and generate clustering algorithms with desirable theoretical properties. The morphism conditions allow controlling sensitivity to density and other features.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper provides a framework for classifying and studying clustering algorithms using the mathematical concepts of categories, functors and functoriality, obtaining existence and uniqueness results for clustering schemes satisfying certain natural conditions.
