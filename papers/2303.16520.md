# [Fair Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Client Contribution   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16520)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. How to simultaneously achieve collaboration fairness and performance fairness in federated learning? 2. How to accurately and efficiently estimate the contribution of each client to the federated learning model?3. Can using the estimated client contributions as aggregation weights in federated learning improve both collaboration fairness and performance fairness?The central hypothesis is that by estimating client contributions considering both gradients and prediction errors, and using these estimated contributions for federated model aggregation, it is possible to achieve better collaboration fairness and performance fairness compared to existing federated learning methods. The key proposal is a new federated learning algorithm called FedCE that incorporates contribution estimation and uses the estimated contributions as aggregation weights. The authors hypothesize this will lead to improvements in both collaboration fairness, by better rewarding client participation, and performance fairness, by weighting client updates according to their contribution to the global model performance. The experiments aim to validate whether FedCE actually achieves these goals compared to other state-of-the-art federated learning methods.In summary, the core research questions focus on quantifying client contributions for fair federated learning in a robust and practical way, and demonstrating the benefits of using contribution-based aggregation for improving collaboration and performance fairness. The proposal of FedCE and experiments aim to test this central hypothesis.
