# [Fair Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Client Contribution   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16520)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The key research questions addressed in this paper are:

1. How to simultaneously achieve collaboration fairness and performance fairness in federated learning? 

2. How to accurately and efficiently estimate the contribution of each client to the federated learning model?

3. Can using the estimated client contributions as aggregation weights in federated learning improve both collaboration fairness and performance fairness?

The central hypothesis is that by estimating client contributions considering both gradients and prediction errors, and using these estimated contributions for federated model aggregation, it is possible to achieve better collaboration fairness and performance fairness compared to existing federated learning methods. 

The key proposal is a new federated learning algorithm called FedCE that incorporates contribution estimation and uses the estimated contributions as aggregation weights. The authors hypothesize this will lead to improvements in both collaboration fairness, by better rewarding client participation, and performance fairness, by weighting client updates according to their contribution to the global model performance. The experiments aim to validate whether FedCE actually achieves these goals compared to other state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

In summary, the core research questions focus on quantifying client contributions for fair federated learning in a robust and practical way, and demonstrating the benefits of using contribution-based aggregation for improving collaboration and performance fairness. The proposal of FedCE and experiments aim to test this central hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new method for estimating client contributions in federated learning. The method considers both gradient space (by measuring gradient direction differences) and data space (by measuring prediction error using an auxiliary model). 

2. A new federated learning algorithm called FedCE that uses the estimated client contributions as aggregation weights when averaging model updates. This aims to improve both collaboration fairness and performance fairness.

3. Theoretical analysis of the robustness of the contribution estimation method to distribution shifts, and convergence analysis of the FedCE algorithm.

4. Empirical evaluation on two medical imaging datasets (retinal fundus and prostate MRI segmentation) showing improved performance over baselines. The experiments also validate properties like faster convergence and robustness to free riders.

In summary, the key innovation is the client contribution estimation method that considers both gradients and model performance. This allows more accurate estimation of how much each client is contributing to the federated model. The estimated contributions are then used to improve fairness and performance in the proposed FedCE algorithm. The theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new federated learning method called FedCE that aims to improve collaboration fairness by estimating each client's contribution and performance fairness by using the contribution estimates to weight client model updates, and shows improved performance and fairness on medical image segmentation tasks compared to prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in federated learning for medical imaging:

- Compared to other work on collaboration fairness like CFFL and CGSV, this paper proposes a new method (FedCE) for estimating client contributions in both gradient and data space. The experiments show FedCE leads to better collaboration fairness and performance fairness. 

- For performance fairness, this paper experiments on real heterogeneous medical datasets instead of arbitrary data splits like many existing works. The proposed FedCE method is shown to greatly improve the worst performing client and reduce performance variance across clients.

- The paper links collaboration fairness estimation with performance fairness optimization. Most prior works studied them separately, while this work proposes to use contribution estimation to also improve training performance.

- For medical imaging, this is one of the first works to tackle fairness in federated learning settings with multi-source heterogeneous data. Many existing federated learning papers focus on simpler image datasets like MNIST.

- The proposed contribution estimation method is inspired by Shapley value but uses a more efficient approximation. Compared to other SV estimation methods in federated learning, this work does not require repeat training on different client subsets.

- The theoretical analysis on convergence and robustness to distribution shift provides insights into why the proposed approach works. This kind of analysis is still relatively rare for recent federated learning algorithms.

Overall, this paper presents a novel perspective to connect collaboration fairness and performance fairness, supported by strong empirical results on medical datasets. The proposed contribution estimation and training approach are intuitive yet effective. The comparisons and analysis help highlight the advantages of this method over existing alternatives.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing methods to jointly optimize for both collaboration fairness and performance fairness in federated learning. The authors propose an approach to address both types of fairness but note that studying them together is still an open problem.

- Extending the proposed client contribution estimation method to other federated learning scenarios such as non-IID data and adversarial robustness. The contribution estimation provides a way to quantify client importance that could be useful in other settings.

- Further investigation into final client rewards/credit allocation, which involves comprehensive factors like computing costs, data annotation costs, data quality, etc. in addition to the performance-based contribution proposed in this work.

- Applying and evaluating the proposed approach on more complex medical imaging tasks and datasets. The authors demonstrate results on retinal fundus and prostate MRI segmentation but suggest further validation is needed for medical applications.

- Detecting adversarial clients and considering fairness for clients with noisy data. The authors propose these as important directions for developing robust federated learning methods.

- Theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior and bounds on the contribution estimation under different data distributions. The authors provide some analysis but suggest further theoretical work could help guide algorithm design.

- Comparing with more federated learning methods, especially recent state-of-the-art approaches. Evaluation on more benchmark tasks may also be informative.

Overall, the authors propose continuing to develop federated learning methods that address collaboration fairness and performance fairness together, with a focus on validation in complex medical imaging applications. They also suggest several areas for additional theoretical analysis to guide algorithm design.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new federated learning method called FedCE to improve collaboration fairness and performance fairness in medical image segmentation tasks. The key idea is to estimate each client's contribution by comparing their gradients and validation errors to the rest of the clients. This provides a more robust estimate than just using sample sizes. Based on the contribution estimates, FedCE aggregates models using these values as weights rather than just sample proportions. This allows low-contributing clients to be downweighted while highly contributing clients are upweighted.

The authors evaluate FedCE on retinal fundus and prostate MRI segmentation using data from multiple hospitals/sources, showing realistic heterogeneity. Experiments demonstrate FedCE improves segmentation accuracy and fairness over state-of-the-art methods like q-FedAvg and CGSV. Analytical studies also validate the robustness of the contribution estimation and the improved convergence of FedCE. Overall, by jointly considering collaboration and performance fairness via contribution estimation, FedCE advances the state-of-the-art in developing fair and accurate federated learning for medical imaging applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel federated learning method called FedCE to optimize both collaboration fairness and performance fairness simultaneously. The key idea is to estimate each client's contribution by comparing it to all other clients in both gradient space and data space. In gradient space, the differences in gradient directions are measured using cosine similarity. In data space, the prediction error on client data is calculated using an auxiliary model trained without that client's parameters. These two contribution measurements are combined to quantify each client's importance. The estimated contributions are then used as aggregation weights when updating the global model, instead of using sample proportions like in standard federated averaging. Using the contribution weights helps promote training on diverse clients and data distributions, improving overall performance and fairness. The proposed FedCE method combines this contribution estimation mechanism with federated training to simultaneously address collaboration fairness through contribution measurement and performance fairness through weighted aggregation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of ensuring both collaboration fairness and performance fairness in federated learning (FL). The main questions it aims to tackle are:

- How to fairly estimate the contribution of each client to motivate their participation in FL? This relates to collaboration fairness.

- How to improve the performance of all clients, especially those with less data or different data distributions, to achieve performance fairness? 

The key insight is that these two problems are coupled - estimating client contributions can help improve training and fairness. But existing works address them separately. So the paper proposes a novel method to optimize both types of fairness simultaneously.

The key contributions are:

1) A new client contribution estimation method that considers both gradient space and data space.

2) A new federated learning algorithm FedCE that uses the contribution estimates to weight client model aggregation. This helps achieve both collaboration and performance fairness. 

3) Theoretical analysis on the robustness of contribution estimation and convergence of the proposed method.

4) Experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks that demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation performance, collaboration fairness, and performance fairness.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in modeling the connection between collaboration and performance fairness, and proposing an effective solution tailored for medical imaging applications. The new contribution estimation and algorithm help engage diverse clients and improve individual performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to estimate client contribution by considering both gradient space and data space. In gradient space, how might the proposed cosine similarity metric be affected if some clients have very small sample sizes or low-quality data? Could this skew the contribution estimation?

2. For the data space contribution measurement using prediction error, the paper excludes a client's parameters when evaluating on that client's data. However, wouldn't a client's parameters still indirectly impact the aggregated model? How might this indirect influence affect the error measurement?

3. The paper combines the gradient and data space measurements multiplicatively and additively. What are the theoretical or empirical motivations behind choosing these specific combination functions? Have other options like harmonic mean been explored? 

4. How does the contribution estimation handle new clients that join federated learning after some rounds of training? Does it require re-estimating contributions from scratch or can new clients be incrementally added?

5. Have different neural network architectures been explored for the contribution estimation and federated learning framework? Could something like attention mechanisms help better model relationships between clients?

6. For the theoretical analysis, are there any assumptions made about the underlying data distributions of clients? How would multi-modal, heavily skewed, or long-tailed distributions affect the analysis?

7. The free rider detection method seems dependent on inspecting cosine similarity trends over training rounds. Are there alternative instantaneous methods to detect free riders that do not require looking at historical trends?

8. How does the contribution estimation and FedCE algorithm handle scenarios with a large number of clients (e.g. 100+)? Does the approximation method still work effectively?

9. The paper focuses on medical image applications. How might the proposed methods need to be adapted for other data modalities like text or tabular data? What are the key challenges?

This paper proposes a new method for improving fairness in federated learning called FedCE. The key idea is to estimate each client's contribution to the global model by measuring differences in gradient direction and prediction error compared to other clients. This allows approximating the Shapley value to quantify collaboration fairness. The estimated contributions are then used as aggregation weights when updating the global model, which helps improve performance fairness by giving more influence to unique/underrepresented clients. The authors propose and analyze the algorithm theoretically, showing it promotes convergence.
