# [Fair Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Client Contribution   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16520)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. How to simultaneously achieve collaboration fairness and performance fairness in federated learning? 2. How to accurately and efficiently estimate the contribution of each client to the federated learning model?3. Can using the estimated client contributions as aggregation weights in federated learning improve both collaboration fairness and performance fairness?The central hypothesis is that by estimating client contributions considering both gradients and prediction errors, and using these estimated contributions for federated model aggregation, it is possible to achieve better collaboration fairness and performance fairness compared to existing federated learning methods. The key proposal is a new federated learning algorithm called FedCE that incorporates contribution estimation and uses the estimated contributions as aggregation weights. The authors hypothesize this will lead to improvements in both collaboration fairness, by better rewarding client participation, and performance fairness, by weighting client updates according to their contribution to the global model performance. The experiments aim to validate whether FedCE actually achieves these goals compared to other state-of-the-art federated learning methods.In summary, the core research questions focus on quantifying client contributions for fair federated learning in a robust and practical way, and demonstrating the benefits of using contribution-based aggregation for improving collaboration and performance fairness. The proposal of FedCE and experiments aim to test this central hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A new method for estimating client contributions in federated learning. The method considers both gradient space (by measuring gradient direction differences) and data space (by measuring prediction error using an auxiliary model). 2. A new federated learning algorithm called FedCE that uses the estimated client contributions as aggregation weights when averaging model updates. This aims to improve both collaboration fairness and performance fairness.3. Theoretical analysis of the robustness of the contribution estimation method to distribution shifts, and convergence analysis of the FedCE algorithm.4. Empirical evaluation on two medical imaging datasets (retinal fundus and prostate MRI segmentation) showing improved performance over baselines. The experiments also validate properties like faster convergence and robustness to free riders.In summary, the key innovation is the client contribution estimation method that considers both gradients and model performance. This allows more accurate estimation of how much each client is contributing to the federated model. The estimated contributions are then used to improve fairness and performance in the proposed FedCE algorithm. The theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new federated learning method called FedCE that aims to improve collaboration fairness by estimating each client's contribution and performance fairness by using the contribution estimates to weight client model updates, and shows improved performance and fairness on medical image segmentation tasks compared to prior methods.
