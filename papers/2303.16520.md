# [Fair Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Client Contribution   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16520)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research questions addressed in this paper are:1. How to simultaneously achieve collaboration fairness and performance fairness in federated learning? 2. How to accurately and efficiently estimate the contribution of each client to the federated learning model?3. Can using the estimated client contributions as aggregation weights in federated learning improve both collaboration fairness and performance fairness?The central hypothesis is that by estimating client contributions considering both gradients and prediction errors, and using these estimated contributions for federated model aggregation, it is possible to achieve better collaboration fairness and performance fairness compared to existing federated learning methods. The key proposal is a new federated learning algorithm called FedCE that incorporates contribution estimation and uses the estimated contributions as aggregation weights. The authors hypothesize this will lead to improvements in both collaboration fairness, by better rewarding client participation, and performance fairness, by weighting client updates according to their contribution to the global model performance. The experiments aim to validate whether FedCE actually achieves these goals compared to other state-of-the-art federated learning methods.In summary, the core research questions focus on quantifying client contributions for fair federated learning in a robust and practical way, and demonstrating the benefits of using contribution-based aggregation for improving collaboration and performance fairness. The proposal of FedCE and experiments aim to test this central hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A new method for estimating client contributions in federated learning. The method considers both gradient space (by measuring gradient direction differences) and data space (by measuring prediction error using an auxiliary model). 2. A new federated learning algorithm called FedCE that uses the estimated client contributions as aggregation weights when averaging model updates. This aims to improve both collaboration fairness and performance fairness.3. Theoretical analysis of the robustness of the contribution estimation method to distribution shifts, and convergence analysis of the FedCE algorithm.4. Empirical evaluation on two medical imaging datasets (retinal fundus and prostate MRI segmentation) showing improved performance over baselines. The experiments also validate properties like faster convergence and robustness to free riders.In summary, the key innovation is the client contribution estimation method that considers both gradients and model performance. This allows more accurate estimation of how much each client is contributing to the federated model. The estimated contributions are then used to improve fairness and performance in the proposed FedCE algorithm. The theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new federated learning method called FedCE that aims to improve collaboration fairness by estimating each client's contribution and performance fairness by using the contribution estimates to weight client model updates, and shows improved performance and fairness on medical image segmentation tasks compared to prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in federated learning for medical imaging:- Compared to other work on collaboration fairness like CFFL and CGSV, this paper proposes a new method (FedCE) for estimating client contributions in both gradient and data space. The experiments show FedCE leads to better collaboration fairness and performance fairness. - For performance fairness, this paper experiments on real heterogeneous medical datasets instead of arbitrary data splits like many existing works. The proposed FedCE method is shown to greatly improve the worst performing client and reduce performance variance across clients.- The paper links collaboration fairness estimation with performance fairness optimization. Most prior works studied them separately, while this work proposes to use contribution estimation to also improve training performance.- For medical imaging, this is one of the first works to tackle fairness in federated learning settings with multi-source heterogeneous data. Many existing federated learning papers focus on simpler image datasets like MNIST.- The proposed contribution estimation method is inspired by Shapley value but uses a more efficient approximation. Compared to other SV estimation methods in federated learning, this work does not require repeat training on different client subsets.- The theoretical analysis on convergence and robustness to distribution shift provides insights into why the proposed approach works. This kind of analysis is still relatively rare for recent federated learning algorithms.Overall, this paper presents a novel perspective to connect collaboration fairness and performance fairness, supported by strong empirical results on medical datasets. The proposed contribution estimation and training approach are intuitive yet effective. The comparisons and analysis help highlight the advantages of this method over existing alternatives.
