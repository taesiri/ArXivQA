# [Edge Detectors Can Make Deep Convolutional Neural Networks More Robust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples - inputs with small perturbations that cause the model to make incorrect predictions. This is a major issue for deploying DCNNs in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. The paper argues that DCNNs rely mostly on texture features whereas human vision relies more on shape features, which makes humans more robust to small perturbations. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a learnable binary edge feature branch (BEFB) that can be integrated into any DCNN architecture. BEFB consists of:

1) Four learnable edge detectors as convolution kernels to extract horizontal, vertical and diagonal edge features. 

2) Multiple "Sobel layers" using these edge detectors as kernels to extract edge maps.

3) A threshold layer to binarize the edge maps into binary edge features.

The binary edge features focus on shape and are concatenated with the regular texture features from the DCNN backbone for classification. This allows the model to leverage both shape and texture cues.

Contributions:

1) A lightweight BEFB module that can be easily integrated into any DCNN and has no negative impact on training.

2) Extensive experiments showing BEFB makes VGG16 and ResNet34 significantly more robust to FGSM, PGD and CW attacks on CIFAR-10, MNIST, SVHN and Tiny ImageNet datasets.

3) Combining BEFB with adversarial training and prototype conformity loss techniques further improves robustness over the original models.  

4) First demonstration that combining shape-like and texture features can improve model robustness to perturbations, opening up new research directions.

In summary, the paper makes DCNNs more robust by proposing a method to incorporate human-inspired binary edge features using a simple yet effective BEFB module.
