# [NECA: Neural Customizable Human Avatar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Human avatars are becoming increasingly useful for applications like metaverse, telepresence, and games. However, most existing methods for creating neural human avatars are limited in customizability, only enabling animation or relighting rather than full control over aspects like pose, shape, lighting, texture, and shadow. There is a need for methods that can generate customizable and photorealistic human avatars.

Method:
This paper proposes NECA, a novel framework to learn fully customizable neural human avatars from monocular or sparse multi-view videos. The key ideas are:

1) Represent humans in complementary canonical and surface spaces to capture both high-frequency details and geometry-aware characteristics. 

2) Disentangle the representation into distinct neural fields for geometry, albedo, shadow and lighting to enable granular control.

3) Self-supervised training with only photometric losses and normal regularization.

Specifically, a pose-aware feature is defined on factorized tri-planes in the canonical space to enable deformation, while a subject-level feature using local tangent space coordinates and UV map facilitates consistency. Separate MLPs then predict properties like SDF, albedo and shadow fields. Volumetric rendering creates photorealistic results.

Contributions:
1) NECA is the first approach to enable full control over pose, shape, lighting, texture and shadow for neural human avatars.

2) The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks like novel pose synthesis and relighting. 

3) Extensive qualitative results demonstrate real-world editing scenarios like reposing, reshaping, retexturing, relighting and reshadowing.

The approach advances the capability for customizable and photorealistic neural human digitization with applications across gaming, VR, digital fashion and more. Limitations relate to sensitivity to pose estimate errors and environment lighting assumptions.
