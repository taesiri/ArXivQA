# [Sim-to-Real gap in RL: Use Case with TIAGo and Isaac Sim/Gym](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07091)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on skimming through the paper, it seems the main contribution is presenting results on the existence of periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems in the convex case. Specifically:

- It considers the boundary value problem of finding T-periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems where the Hamiltonian H(t,x) is convex in x and goes to infinity as ||x|| goes to infinity. 

- It presents results on the existence and non-triviality of such periodic solutions under certain conditions on the Hamiltonian (e.g. being (A_infty, B_infty)-subquadratic). 

- It gives specific corollaries and examples for autonomous Hamiltonian systems that are (a_infty, b_infty)-subquadratic showing the existence of non-constant periodic solutions.

- It also has results on subharmonics, i.e. periodic solutions with lower period than T. 

So in summary, the main contribution seems to be theorems and analysis related to the existence of periodic and subharmonic solutions to convex Hamiltonian systems under certain conditions. The techniques use a dual action functional and build upon previous work in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses using a duality approach to treat periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems in the convex-subquadratic case. Can you explain in more detail how this duality approach works and why it is advantageous? 

2. In the analysis of the boundary value problem, the authors utilize an action functional involving terms N(x) and N*(x). Can you discuss the significance of these terms and how they are used in the minimization procedure?

3. When proving proposition 14, the authors rely on an exercise in convex analysis involving conditions (10) and (11). Can you explain how these conditions are derived and why they enable the subsequent proof arguments?  

4. Corollary 2 provides a non-triviality condition involving the eigenvalues of Λ and H''(ξk). Can you interpret the meaning of this mathematical condition in physical terms? What is the intuition behind it?

5. The note after Proposition 14 mentions a one-parameter family of solutions xT. Can you elaborate on what this family represents conceptually and why it suggests the form of condition (14)?

6. Theorem 21 is central to many of the arguments but its proof is omitted. Can you summarize what this theorem achieves and the key ideas involved in its proof?

7. In the example of external forcing, the authors choose a particular form for f(t) involving Dirac delta functions. What is the motivation behind this choice mathematically and physically?

8. Definition 8 introduces several technical assumptions on the Hamiltonian H(t,x). Can you explain the physical meaning of each assumption and why they are important?

9. The note after Definition 8 discusses early work on subharmonics by Rabinowitz. Can you summarize Rabinowitz's contributions and approach in more detail? 

10. The analysis in Section 4.1 focuses on the autonomous case where H does not depend explicitly on t. How would the analysis differ in the non-autonomous setting? What additional complications would arise?
