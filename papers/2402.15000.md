# [Divide-or-Conquer? Which Part Should You Distill Your LLM?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15000)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks can be very costly during inference when the reasoning chain is long. 
- LLMs are also opaque black box models that offer limited adaptability. 
- Distilling LLMs into smaller models often seriously harms performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- Break down reasoning tasks into two capabilities - problem decomposition and problem solving.
- Hypothesize that decomposition relies more on general problem solving strategies while solving requires domain knowledge. Thus, decomposing should be easier to distill.
- Propose distilling only the decomposition capability from the teacher LLM into a smaller student model. Keep using teacher LLM or other large models for solving.

Main Contributions:
1) Demonstrate the possibility and effectiveness of distilling only the query decomposition part. The distilled model maintains most performance while significantly reducing inference costs. However, distilling the solving part leads to considerable performance decline.

2) Show that the distilled decomposition model exhibits good generalization across tasks, datasets and models. But the distilled solving for each task does not generalize well.

3) Indicate that by using smaller, distilled decomposition models with LLMs, we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and better flexibility for local adaptation.

In summary, the key insight is to separate the decomposition and solving capabilities for complex reasoning tasks, and only distill the former as it is more generalizable and compressible. This allows leveraging the power of large LLMs in a more cost-efficient and adaptable manner.
