# [Generative Bias for Robust Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00690)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: 

How can we best model the biases in a visual question answering (VQA) model in order to improve its robustness and mitigate reliance on biases? 

The authors hypothesize that directly modeling the biases of the target VQA model, rather than just the dataset biases, will allow for more effective debiasing. To test this, they propose a novel generative bias model called GenB that learns to mimic the target model's biases using adversarial training and knowledge distillation. The key idea is that a bias model that better captures the target model's biases can provide stronger debiasing supervision. They demonstrate state-of-the-art debiasing performance on various VQA datasets, supporting their hypothesis.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that learning to model the target VQA model's biases directly, using a generative approach, will enable more effective debiasing compared to prior bias modeling methods. The experiments aim to validate whether the proposed GenB method can improve robustness by better capturing biases.
