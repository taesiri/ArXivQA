# [Brain-Inspired Machine Intelligence: A Survey of   Neurobiologically-Plausible Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09257)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of biologically-inspired algorithms for credit assignment in artificial neural networks. Credit assignment refers to the problem of determining how to assign "credit" or "blame" to individual units in a neural network based on their contribution to the final output. 

The paper first provides background on the popular backpropagation algorithm, which is the default method for credit assignment in most modern deep neural networks. However, backpropagation has been criticized over the years as being biologically implausible. The paper summarizes the main problems with backpropagation, including requiring symmetric weights between layers, a separate backward pass, and non-local weight updates.

The core of the paper is a taxonomy that organizes biologically-inspired credit assignment algorithms based on the source of the learning signals that drive weight updates. The taxonomy has two main branches: implicit target signals, where no explicit targets are used, and explicit target signals, which are further divided into global versus local and synergistic versus non-synergistic signals. 

The paper reviews six families of algorithms within this taxonomy:

- Implicit signal algorithms like Hebbian learning that use only local pre- and post-synaptic activity
- Explicit global signal algorithms like neuromodulated Hebbian learning driven by global reward signals 
- Non-synergistic explicit local signal algorithms like synthetic gradient methods
- Synergistic explicit local signal algorithms based on discrepancy reduction (e.g. predictive coding), energy minimization (e.g. contrastive Hebbian learning), and forward-only passes (no backpropagation).

For each family, the paper summarizes key algorithms, how they address deficiencies of backpropagation, and evidence of their application to problems like computer vision and reinforcement learning. 

The paper concludes by arguing that no single algorithm likely explains learning in the brain, but combinations across the taxonomy may lead to more capable and efficient artificial learning systems. Future challenges include scaling up algorithms to complex tasks and ensuring algorithms are compatible with spiking neural networks and neuromorphic hardware.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This survey examines and organizes a range of algorithms for biologically-inspired credit assignment in artificial neural networks according to a proposed taxonomy based on the driving signals behind synaptic plasticity, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and future opportunities towards brain-inspired machine intelligence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of biologically-inspired approaches to credit assignment in artificial neural networks. The key contributions are:

1) It proposes a taxonomy for organizing different families of biologically-plausible credit assignment algorithms based on the central question: where do the target signals that drive synaptic plasticity come from and how are they produced? This results in six families: implicit signals, explicit global signals, non-synergistic explicit local signals, and synergistic explicit local signals (further divided into discrepancy-reduction, energy-based, and forward-only).

2) It characterizes and elucidates the core problems and biological implausibilities of backpropagation of errors (backprop), which is the predominant algorithm used to train modern deep neural networks. 

3) It systematically reviews and synthesizes a wide range of backprop-free, neurobiologically-inspired credit assignment algorithms developed over past decades according to the proposed taxonomy. For each family, key algorithms, their mechanics, neurobiological connections, and resolution of backprop's issues are examined.

4) It summarizes the current state and open challenges of biologically-plausible credit assignment through comparative analyses across families with respect to: backprop problem resolution, flexibility across neural architectures, applicability to key AI task domains, and generalization to spiking neural networks. 

In summary, this paper provides a unifying treatment and thorough reference for understanding and advancing research towards more brain-like learning algorithms and intelligent systems. The taxonomy and literature synthesis offer useful organizing principles and highlight important open questions for the field.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on biologically-inspired approaches to credit assignment:

1. The paper proposes a taxonomy for organizing biologically-inspired credit assignment algorithms based on the central question: "Where do the signals that drive learning in neuronal networks come from and how are they produced?" How well does this taxonomy capture the key differences between approaches? Are there any gaps or limitations?

2. The paper reviews six families of algorithms - implicit signals, explicit global signals, non-synergistic explicit local signals, and three types of synergistic explicit local signals (discrepancy reduction, energy-based, and forward-only). How might these families be combined in a hybrid system to leverage their complementary strengths? What would be some of the key challenges in integrating across such heterogeneous credit assignment schemes?

3. The survey examines how different credit assignment schemes address issues like the global feedback pathway problem, weight transport problem, inference-learning dependency, etc. But are there other critical issues, beyond those highlighted, that should be considered in developing biologically plausible learning algorithms?

4. The paper argues that future progress requires balancing biological realism and performance/scalability. But where should this balance lie? How much neurobiological fidelity do we need for artificial systems to generalize like humans? Is there a point of diminishing returns?

5. How suitable are the various credit assignment schemes for training neuromorphic systems and low-power analog hardware platforms? What modifications might be needed to map algorithms to spike-based dynamics and platforms with restricted memory/computational budgets?  

6. The survey identifies control/reinforcement learning as an area in need of further development across most families of credit assignment algorithms. What makes RL uniquely challenging for biological learning schemes? How might ideas from neuroscience and cognitive architectures inform progress?

7. Forward-only credit assignment is highlighted as satisfying key criteria related to biological plausibility and scalability. But are there unexplored issues or limitations to such approaches? Under what conditions might forward-only schemes struggle?

8. Predictive coding is noted as the most prominent algorithm for tackling control/RL tasks. But how might other schemes like Hebbian learning or equilibrium propagation be extended to decision-making and active inference problems? What advances are needed?

9. Theoretical connections between algorithms like predictive coding, target propagation, contrastive Hebbian learning and backpropagation are noted. Are there additional theoretical relationships between schemes that should be explored further? What insights might these provide?

10. The review examines how different credit assignment families have tackled vision, sequence, and relational modeling tasks. But less work examines interactive/embodied tasks. How should evaluation of biological learning be extended to richer interactive settings and environments?
