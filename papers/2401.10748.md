# [Fast gradient-free activation maximization for neurons in spiking neural   networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper aims to develop a framework for quickly and accurately finding the most effective stimuli (MEIs) that maximize the activation of neurons in spiking neural networks (SNNs). This is an important capability for understanding the function and specialization of neurons.  

- Finding MEIs is challenging because the activation function is a "black box" without an explicit gradient. Previous approaches like genetic algorithms can be slow to converge. Faster techniques are needed, especially for potential applications to living neural systems where minimizing iterations is critical.

Proposed Solution
- The authors propose using optimization methods based on low-rank Tensor Train (TT) decomposition to approximate the activation function and efficiently search for MEIs. Specifically, they employ the PROTES TT optimization technique.

- They incorporate TT optimization into a pipeline with a pretrained SNN classifier on CIFAR-10 images, along with a generator model (GAN or VAE) that creates images from latent vectors. By optimizing latent vectors to maximize target neuron activation, MEIs are obtained.

Contributions
- A new framework called MANGO is introduced for fast MEI search in SNNs using TT optimization and generative models. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of activation maximization in SNNs.

- Experiments demonstrate TT methods converge over 2-4x faster than gradient-free benchmarks like CMA-ES, requiring fewer iterations to find high-quality MEIs.

- Analysis reveals the presence of highly selective neurons in early network layers, beyond the expected deeper specialization. Neuron MEIs show increasing diversity in deeper layers as well.

- The work helps connect AI explainability techniques to neuroscience and paves the way for efficient activation maximization in living neural systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new pipeline with efficient tensor optimization methods for quickly finding stimuli that maximize spiking neural network neurons' activation, demonstrating it successfully on an artificial spiking ResNet model trained on CIFAR-10 images generated by GAN and VAE networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1) Introducing a pipeline/framework (called MANGO) for fast and accurate computation of most exciting images (MEIs) that maximize neural activation in artificial neural networks, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs). This is done for the first time for SNNs.

2) Comparing different optimization methods, including novel methods based on Tensor Train (TT) decomposition, for neural activation maximization. The TT methods are shown to outperform gradient-free benchmarks like CMA-ES, being 2-4x faster.

3) Analyzing the learned representations and selectivity of neurons in different layers of SNNs by generating MEIs. Showing the presence of highly selective neurons even in early layers of the network.

4) Comparing two generative models - VAEs and GANs - for generating MEI stimuli images. GANs are shown to provide richer and more interpretable MEIs compared to VAEs.

5) Introducing TT-based optimization methods for the first time in the context of activation maximization and demonstrating their effectiveness. This could be useful for future applications in neuroscience experiments.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an effective pipeline/framework for neural activation maximization in SNNs, especially using TT-based optimization methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework called MANGO for fast and accurate computation of most exciting images (MEIs) in artificial neural networks. What are some key components and capabilities of the MANGO framework? How is it useful for studying neuron activation maximization?

2. The paper compares multiple optimization methods like Nevergrad, TTOpt, PROTES etc. Can you explain the key ideas behind PROTES optimization method and how it utilizes tensor train (TT) decomposition for efficient search? Why is it more suitable than gradient-based methods?

3. The paper tests the activation maximization pipeline on spiking neural networks (SNNs) instead of standard ANNs. What is the motivation behind using more biologically plausible SNN models? How are stimuli encoded and fed to the SNN? 

4. The paper observes that tensor train based methods converge to similar MEIs as the benchmark Nevergrad method. What does this suggest about the landscape and optima of the activation function according to the authors?

5. For the generative models, VAE-VQ performs poorer than GAN-SN in producing interpretable MEIs. Can you analyze the possible reasons behind it based on their architectures and latent spaces?

6. The paper finds highly selective neurons for certain classes in early layers of the SNN. How is the neuronal selectivity quantified in the paper? Why is this an interesting and slightly counter-intuitive finding?

7. The variability and diversity of MEIs is found to increase in deeper SNN layers. What metrics are used to demonstrate this quantitatively? How do the authors explain this effect?

8. What are some limitations of the current work highlighted by the authors? What future research directions seem most promising to them for activation maximization? 

9. Can these MEI search techniques be potentially applied to biological neural networks? What constraints need to be addressed before that?

10. How does this work relate to the field of interpretable AI and neural network visualization for explainability? Can you situate it with respect to some recent work in those areas?
