# [Never-Ending Embodied Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00336)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores a new challenging problem called "Never-Ending Embodied Robot Learning (NERL)". In NERL, a robot needs to continually learn a stream of new manipulation skills from visual observations, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of old skills. Existing methods have limitations in handling the complex skill-wise knowledge and suffer from forgetting when adapting to new unseen tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel agent called NBCagent to address the challenges in NERL. The key ideas include:

1) Skill-Specific Evolving Planner (SEP): Learns skill-specific knowledge from latent and low-rank space to focus on new skills and reduce interference between skills.  

2) Skill-Shared Semantics Rendering Module (SSR): Transfers skill-shared 3D semantics across skills using a NeRF model, to mitigate forgetting.

3) Skill-Shared Representation Distillation Module (SRD): Aligns skill-shared representations between current and old models using distillation, also to reduce forgetting.

Together, SEP enables learning new skills continually, while SSR and SRD transfer common knowledge to counter forgetting.

Contributions:

- Proposes the new problem setting NERL and the NBCagent solution.

- Designs SEP to learn skill-specific knowledge continually for new skills.

- Develops SSR and SRD modules to transfer skill-shared knowledge across skills and reduce catastrophic forgetting.

- Provides new continual robot manipulation benchmark datasets. 

- Demonstrates NBCagent significantly outperforms baselines in NERL over the benchmark.

In summary, the paper pioneers the NERL problem and proposes an innovative continual learning agent NBCagent to learn robotic manipulation skills continually from visual inputs while minimizing forgetting. The extensive experiments verify the efficacy of NBCagent.
