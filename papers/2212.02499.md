# [Images Speak in Images: A Generalist Painter for In-Context Visual   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: how can we develop a generalist vision model capable of rapidly adapting to diverse visual tasks using only image-based prompts and examples, enabling in-context visual learning? The key hypotheses are:1) Most vision tasks can be formulated as image inpainting, where the model is given an input image and asked to generate some desired output image. By representing task outputs as images, different tasks can be unified under the same framework.2) A model trained on diverse tasks using masked image modeling, where input-output image pairs are stitched together and pixels from the output image are predicted from visible pixels of the input, will learn to perform tasks conditioned on visual context. 3) At inference time, providing the model with example input-output image pairs from a task will prompt it to perform that task on new inputs, enabling in-context prediction without task-specific heads or tuning.In summary, the central research question is how to develop in-context visual learning, where a generalist model can rapidly adapt to new vision tasks given just image-based examples. The key hypotheses are that formulating tasks as image inpainting and training with masked image modeling can provide this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are the main contributions:- The paper proposes a new generalist vision model called Painter that can perform a diverse set of visual tasks in an in-context manner with only image examples as prompts. This allows rapid adaptation to tasks without modifying the model architecture or parameters.- It unifies the output spaces of various vision tasks like segmentation, depth estimation, keypoint detection etc. into 3-channel image representations. This allows treating most vision tasks as conditional image inpainting problems.- The model is trained via masked image modeling on stitched input-output image pairs from the same tasks. This provides a simple but effective framework to train a generalist model on multiple tasks.- Without specialized architectures or loss functions, Painter achieves competitive performance on 7 vision tasks compared to task-specific models. It also outperforms recent generalist models on challenging tasks like depth estimation and keypoint detection.- Painter demonstrates strong generalization ability to adapt to novel tasks and categories outside its training distribution using just image prompts. This shows its in-context learning capability.In summary, the key contribution is presenting a vision-centric framework to enable in-context visual learning using images as general interfaces. The simplicity of the approach combined with strong performance across diverse tasks highlights its viability and potential.
