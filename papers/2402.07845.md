# [Unsupervised Optimisation of GNNs for Node Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates whether graph neural networks (GNNs) can be optimized for node clustering without any comparison to ground-truth labels during training. Specifically, it examines whether the unsupervised metrics of modularity and conductance can be used for model selection and hyperparameter optimization of GNNs instead of labeled data. This is an important problem because in many real-world scenarios, ground-truth labels are not available for model optimization.  

The paper seeks to answer the following key research questions:

- RQ1: Can unsupervised metric performance predict ground-truth performance for GNN node clustering? 
- RQ2: Does unsupervised GNN optimization lead to a significant drop in ground-truth performance?
- RQ3: Can unsupervised metrics successfully optimize GNN hyperparameters?
- RQ4: What is the minimum labeled data needed for effective unsupervised GNN optimization?
- RQ5: Why does optimizing GNNs with unsupervised metrics like modularity work?

Proposed Solution and Contributions

The key proposal is using the unsupervised metrics of modularity and conductance for GNN model selection and hyperparameter optimization instead of ground-truth labels. The performance on these metrics is correlated with ground-truth metrics to see if they can serve as a proxy.

The main contributions are:

- Demonstrating moderate correlation between optimizing for modularity and ground-truth performance of GNNs, enabling unsupervised model selection. However, conductance did not correlate well.

- Showing only a minor drop in ground-truth performance when using modularity instead of labels for GNN optimization.

- Successfully optimizing GNN hyperparameters with modularity, improving over default hyperparameters.

- Finding a dependence between graph structure and predictability of ground-truth performance from unsupervised metrics.

- Using synthetic datasets to uncover a bias in GNNs towards clustering in the adjacency space when optimized with modularity.

In summary, the paper shows the feasibility of using modularity to optimize and select GNN models for node clustering without ground-truth data, with implications for real-world deployment. The analysis also reveals limitations in properly utilizing all information spaces.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates using unsupervised metrics like modularity to optimize graph neural networks for node clustering, finding that modularity can serve as a proxy for ground truth performance and be used for model selection and hyperparameter optimization, though GNNs are biased towards clustering structure in the adjacency space over features when optimized this way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates whether graph neural networks (GNNs) for node clustering can be optimized using only unsupervised evaluation metrics like modularity and conductance, without relying on any ground truth/labeled data. The key findings are:

- Modularity as an unsupervised optimization metric shows correlation with ground truth metrics like NMI and F1-score. This means modularity can be used as a proxy for ground truth performance to select and optimize GNN models in the absence of labels.

- Using modularity for model selection and hyperparameter optimization leads to good clustering performance compared to using ground truth, with only a small drop in performance. This enables practical unsupervised training of GNNs.

- The extent of the correlation between unsupervised and ground truth metrics depends on the amount of graph structure vs feature information in the dataset. Datasets with more graph structure show higher correlation.

- Experiments on synthetic datasets show GNNs are biased towards graph/connectivity structure when optimized on modularity, compared to feature information. This indicates a limitation in balancing the two sources of information.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating the viability of using modularity to train GNNs for node clustering task in a completely unsupervised manner, despite some limitations. This enables applications in scenarios with unlabeled data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using unsupervised metrics like modularity and conductance for optimizing and selecting GNN models for node clustering instead of relying on ground truth labels. Why is this useful? What are some potential real-world applications where this approach would be valuable?

2. The paper finds modularity has a higher correlation with ground truth performance compared to conductance. Why do you think this is the case? What properties of modularity make it a better proxy metric? 

3. The paper shows the correlation between unsupervised and supervised metrics drops when reducing the training dataset size. What are possible explanations for this drop? How could the approach be adapted to work effectively with less training data?

4. The synthetic data experiments reveal GNNs are biased towards clusters in the adjacency space when optimized on modularity. How could the framework be extended to better utilize feature space clusters as well? What alternative unsupervised metrics could help with this?

5. The paper evaluates multiple GNN architectures like DAEGC, DMON, DGI etc. Are there any other recent unsupervised GNN models for clustering worth investigating with this framework? What modifications would they require?

6. Only a simple grid search is used for hyperparameter optimization. Would more advanced Bayesian optimization methods like TPE lead to better hyperparameters and model performance? Why/why not?  

7. The paper uses a single train/test split. Would techniques like cross-validation provide a more robust estimate of model performance? What are the tradeoffs?

8. Are there any recent advances in understanding the effect of random seeds on neural network training that could help explain the high randomness coefficients?

9. What additional experiments could shed more light on the limiting factors of the unsupervised optimization approach? What hypotheses can be formulated and tested?

10. The paper studies node clustering in static graphs. How could these ideas be extended to dynamic graphs that evolve over time? What additional challenges might arise?
