# [NeuroSynt: A Neuro-symbolic Portfolio Solver for Reactive Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reactive synthesis holds promise for automatically generating correct-by-construction implementations from high-level specifications. However, despite recent progress, scalability remains a fundamental challenge to enabling real-world applications. Symbolic synthesis methods offer formal guarantees but face computational challenges on larger instances. In contrast, machine learning methods are efficient but lack soundness and completeness.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes NeuroSynt, a neuro-symbolic portfolio solver for reactive synthesis. It combines neural network-based synthesis with formal verification to ensure soundness and symbolic synthesis for completeness.

Specifically, NeuroSynt consists of:

1. A neural solver based on a Transformer architecture that generates candidate implementations from the specification.

2. Model checking tools (NuXMV, NuSMV, SPOT) that formally verify the neural network's candidate implementations to ensure soundness.  

3. State-of-the-art symbolic solvers (Strix, BoSy) that run in parallel to provide completeness. If the neural solver fails to find a valid implementation, the symbolic solvers act as a backup.

The components run as isolated Docker containers communicating via gRPC for easy integration and updating. The open source implementation provides an extensible platform to incorporate innovations in neural or symbolic methods for reactive synthesis.

Contributions:

1. Design and implementation of NeuroSynt - an extensible neuro-symbolic portfolio solver framework that bridges efficiency of learning and guarantees of formal methods.

2. An improved neural solver based on a hierarchical Transformer architecture that handles larger specifications and achieves 34.83% accuracy on the SYNTCOMP benchmarks.

3. Demonstrated performance gains over state-of-the-art tools - solves 31 more instances than Strix and 152 more than BoSy on SYNTCOMP benchmarks. A virtual best solver combining NeuroSynt with all SYNTCOMP participants solves 20 additional instances.

4. The neural solver provides smaller solutions compared to symbolic solvers like Strix and BoSy while taking constant time, highlighting prospects for accelerating reactive synthesis.

The results demonstrate the promising capabilities of combining neural synthesis with formal verification and symbolic methods to enhance reactive synthesis performance while preserving trustworthiness. The platform enables further research innovations to address scalability challenges.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is the design and open-source implementation of the extensible and efficient portfolio solver framework called NeuroSynt. Specifically:

- NeuroSynt combines neural and symbolic methods for reactive synthesis in a modular architecture that allows easy integration of new models, algorithms, or optimization techniques. This adaptability ensures NeuroSynt can incorporate the latest innovations in reactive synthesis research.

- It contributes an advanced neural solver for reactive synthesis based on a Transformer architecture that handles larger and more complex specifications, improving performance on real-world SYNTCOMP instances.
