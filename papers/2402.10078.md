# [EventF2S: Asynchronous and Sparse Spiking AER Framework using   Neuromorphic-Friendly Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10078)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AER sensors are gaining popularity due to low power consumption, high sparsity and temporal resolution. However, integrating AER sensors with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) has not adequately explored asynchronous processing, neuromorphic compatibility and sparse spiking which are key for resource-constrained applications.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes EventF2S, an asynchronous and sparse spiking AER recognition framework with two components:
  1) Sparse Spiking Temporal Encoding (SS-TE) layer: Encodes raw AER events into as few informative early spikes as possible using asynchronous LIF filters. Significantly reduces number of spikes for downstream processing.
  2) Spiking Recognition Network: Uses differentiable spiking neurons with First-To-Spike inter-neuron communication. Enables error backpropagation for learning while reducing spike signaling.

Key Contributions:
- Asynchronous processing: Handles events asynchronously without predefined accumulation times.
- Sparse Spiking: Curtails number of spikes to one per pixel and neuron minimizing computation costs. 
- Neuromorphic Compatibility: Design choices align with device physics of neuromorphic hardware enabling brain-like efficiency.
- Accuracy: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for non rate-coded spiking AER recognition networks.
- Computational Efficiency: First layer computations are greatly reduced compared to other methods due to learnable feature extraction and sparse encoding.

In summary, the paper introduces an asynchronous, sparse-spiking AER recognition solution called EventF2S that is hardware friendly while also accurate and computationally efficient compared to prior art.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an asynchronous and sparse spiking aer object recognition framework called EventF2S, which includes a sparse spiking temporal encoding layer for reducing computation cost and a first-to-spike learning spiking network for classification, achieving competitive accuracy with significantly lower spike signaling.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of the proposed EventF2S framework are:

1) Asynchronous processing: EventF2S exhibits asynchronous processing at the input and output layers. It processes the input events from the AER sensor asynchronously as they arrive. At the output layer, the winner neuron fires asynchronously once it has received sufficient spikes to activate it. There is no predefined accumulation time.

2) Sparse spiking: EventF2S reduces the number of spikes to one per pixel at the encoding layer and one per neuron at the feature extraction and classification layers. This promotes sparsity in spike representation.

3) Neuromorphic hardware friendliness: By designing the solution to be compatible with neuromorphic hardware implementation, EventF2S is able to leverage the benefits of neuromorphic systems such as low power consumption, asynchronous event-driven processing, and high temporal resolution.

In summary, the main contribution is an asynchronous and sparse spiking AER recognition system called EventF2S that is hardware friendly and harnessing the advantages of neuromorphic sensors for low-cost edge applications.
