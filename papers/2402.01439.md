   - Adaptation methods like objectives tailored for chemical data (MLM, MPP, ATG) and cross-modal alignment
   - Diverse applications enabled by LLMs' capabilities (chatbots, in-context learning, representation learning) 
   - Unique paradigms for utilizing LLMs in chemistry tasks

Main Contributions:
- Review of molecular representation and tokenization methods
- Systematic taxonomy of existing approaches by pretraining data type
- Analysis of methodologies for adapting chemical data to LLMs
- Investigation of domain-specific pretraining objectives
