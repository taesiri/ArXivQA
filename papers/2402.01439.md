## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "From Words to Molecules: A Survey of Large Language Models in Chemistry":

Problem:
- Applying large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is challenging as it requires specialized domain knowledge to effectively encode chemical information. 
- Existing surveys on pretrained models for chemistry do not fully address the nuanced ways LLMs can be uniquely leveraged.
- There is a need for a systematic survey focused specifically on methodologies and applications of LLMs in chemistry.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a comprehensive survey on strategies for integrating LLMs into chemistry spanning:
   - Molecule encoding methods (e.g. SMILES, fingerprints) and tokenization techniques
   - A taxonomy categorizing approaches by pretraining data domains (single-domain, multi-domain, multi-modal)
   - Adaptation methods like objectives tailored for chemical data (MLM, MPP, ATG) and cross-modal alignment
   - Diverse applications enabled by LLMs' capabilities (chatbots, in-context learning, representation learning) 
   - Unique paradigms for utilizing LLMs in chemistry tasks

Main Contributions:
- Review of molecular representation and tokenization methods
- Systematic taxonomy of existing approaches by pretraining data type
- Analysis of methodologies for adapting chemical data to LLMs
- Investigation of domain-specific pretraining objectives
- Exploration of novel application paradigms of LLMs in chemistry
- Identification of promising future research directions like integration of advanced chemical knowledge, continual learning for LLMs, and interpretability

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the interdisciplinary field of chemical LLMs, offering key insights into the complexities and innovations in effectively applying LLMs to address chemical research problems.
