# [The Human and the Mechanical: logos, truthfulness, and ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01267)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper argues that ChatGPT and similar AI lack key features of human cognition such as the ability to form veridicality judgments grounded in both evidence and subjective preferences, and therefore cannot be said to have a "mind" in the same sense that humans do.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is to argue that ChatGPT and similar AI language models lack key aspects of human cognition that enable judgment, truth evaluations, and moral reasoning. Specifically:

1) ChatGPT lacks "logos" - the ancient Greek concept encompassing language, reason, and judgment that is distinctive of human rationality. Without logos, ChatGPT cannot form representations, abstract concepts, or make ethical distinctions. 

2) ChatGPT lacks the ability to form "veridicality judgments" about the truth or falsity of propositions. This requires referring to reality (exogenous evidence) as well as personal beliefs and preferences (endogenous evidence). Lacking orientation to the world, ChatGPT cannot establish truth conditions. 

3) As a result, ChatGPT lacks essential human abilities like forming beliefs, lying, intending to deceive, or making moral judgments. Its statistical knowledge does not amount to human-level understanding or wisdom (phronesis). 

4) Therefore, the authors argue it is inappropriate to talk about ChatGPT having a "mind" or "mechanical minds" at all. Its abilities are fundamentally different from and inferior to the nature of human cognition. The paper offers conceptual arguments, rooted in ancient philosophy, to support this critique.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

veridicality judgment, evidence, belief, truth, logos, innateness, recollection, veridical commitment, assertion, modality, epistemic stance, nonveridical equilibrium, endogenous and exogenous evidence, phronesis

The paper discusses concepts such as the veridicality judgment that underlies human assertion and communication, drawing a distinction between exogenous (evidence-based) and endogenous (subjective) components that factor into this judgment. It contrasts the capabilities of AI systems like ChatGPT with innate human faculties like language and reason (logos), arguing that machines lack the capacity for genuine judgment, truth commitments, and moral wisdom (phronesis) that characterize human minds. Key terms reflect thissemantic argument regarding meaning, truth, and judgment in analyzing differences between human and "mechanical" intelligence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that veridicality judgment relies on both exogenous (evidence-based) and endogenous (subjective) components. Can you elaborate more on the role of endogenous components in veridicality judgments? How exactly do subjective beliefs and preferences influence truth assessments?

2. The paper introduces a scale of veridical commitment with full commitment, partial commitment (bias), and trivial commitment. Can you provide some additional examples to illustrate the differences between these levels of commitment? What factors determine where a judgment falls on this scale?

3. The paper argues that direct visual perception contexts prohibit modalization, as illustrated in the "seeing the rain" example. Are there any cases or counterexamples where modal language could be acceptable even with direct evidence?

4. How does the proposed veridicality judgment account explain faultless disagreement cases involving matters of taste or ethics? What role do endogenous factors play in such disagreements?

5. The paper emphasizes the importance of intention and cooperation in linguistic communication. How does the veridicality judgment enable speakers to assess intentionality and determine if interlocutors are being truthful?

6. What evidence exists that subjective, endogenous factors often override rational evaluation of evidence in human judgment? What biases tend to influence veridicality assessments? 

7. The paper links veridical commitment to assertability - what a speaker can felicitously assert. What challenges arise in modeling assertability given the influence of subjective factors?

8. How does the role of endogenous v. exogenous factors differ when assessing opinions versus factual statements? What complications arise regarding truth values?

9. Can you elaborate on the proposed definition of trustworthiness of content using endogenous and exogenous evidence? How should the belief measure Î¼ be calculated?

10. What kind of empirical evidence would help evaluate whether this dual-component veridicality judgment model aligns with actual human linguistic behavior? What predictions arise from the theory?
