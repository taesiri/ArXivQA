# [FFSTC: Fongbe to French Speech Translation Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05488)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Speech translation systems have focused on major languages, leaving low-resource languages like Fongbe underserved. This is an issue since Fongbe is a widely spoken tonal language in West Africa (over 8 million speakers) that is predominantly spoken rather than written.
- Lack of speech and text corpora poses challenges for developing Fongbe speech translation systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the Fongbe-French Speech Translation Corpus (FFSTC), the first public parallel speech translation dataset for Fongbe-French.

Methodology: 
- Curated 31 hours of Fongbe speech data from 3 sources: existing Fongbe corpus, Fongbe recordings of French corpus, newly recorded French to Fongbe translations.
- Data split into train, dev, test sets. Train set is 20 hours. 
- Rigorous multi-validator quality control process to ensure accuracy of translations and clarity of audio.

Experiments:
- Use Fairseq toolkit to establish transformer_s and conformer baselines on FFSTC corpus. 
- Transformer model achieves BLEU score of 8.96. Conformer model achieves BLEU of 8.14.
- Scores show promise for building Fongbe-French speech translation system.

Main Contributions:
- Release of first public Fongbe-French parallel speech translation corpus
- Methodical data collection, translation, and quality control process
- Baseline BLEU benchmarks for the corpus using state-of-the-art models
- Enables future research to advance speech translation for low-resource languages

The paper introduces an invaluable new speech dataset that can drive progress in Fongbe-French translation as well as speech translation for other low-resource languages. Rigorous collection and quality standards establish a reliable corpus. Benchmark experiments showcase feasibility for developing performant speech translation models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces the Fongbe to French Speech Translation Corpus (FFSTC), a new 31-hour parallel speech translation dataset for advancing Fongbe-French machine translation, and establishes baseline performance using Fairseq's transformer_s and conformer models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the two key contributions are:

1) The introduction of the Fongbe-French Speech Translation Corpus (FFSTC), which is the first public dataset of speech translations between Fongbe and French. This new corpus contains 31 hours of speech data with diverse speakers and topics.

2) The establishment of a baseline performance by evaluating transformer_s and conformer models from Fairseq on the FFSTC dataset. The models achieved baseline BLEU scores of 8.96 and 8.14 respectively. This benchmark provides a reference point for future research using the FFSTC and helps identify areas for improvement.

So in summary, the main contributions are creating the first Fongbe-French speech translation dataset and setting baseline results on it using state-of-the-art speech translation models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with it are:

"Speech translation corpus", "spoken language translation", "Low-resource", "Fongbe-French", "Fongbe"

As stated in the abstract:

"\Keywords{Speech translation corpus, spoken language translation, Low-resource, Fongbe-French, Fongbe}"

So the key terms and keywords that characterize and represent this paper are "Speech translation corpus", "spoken language translation", "Low-resource", "Fongbe-French", and "Fongbe". These words and phrases succinctly convey the main focus and contributions of the research presented.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that the data comes from three distinct sources. Can you elaborate on the details of each data source and the amount of data contributed from each? 

2. The paper talks about a rigorous validation process for the audio clips. Can you walk through the specific steps involved in validating clips from each data source? What quality control measures were implemented?

3. The vocabulary distribution analysis in Figure 1 shows substantial diversity across splits. In your view, what are the implications of this vocabulary variation for training and evaluating speech translation models?

4. The paper filtered out samples exceeding 3,000 frames during preprocessing. What motivated this decision and how does clip length affect model performance? 

5. The methodology utilizes a collaborative team effort for French to Fongbe sentence translation. Can you discuss this process in more detail and highlight any challenges faced? 

6. Transcript translation involved peer-review by a second validator to ensure accuracy. What quality assurance practices were employed during this validation?

7. The conformer model used absolute positional encodings. How does this differ from relative encodings and why might it impact performance?

8. The results section compares transformer and conformer architectures. What are the key differences between these models in terms of encoder types and strengths?  

9. The BLEU scores indicate potential for improvement. What limitations of the current methodology may have contributed to this and how can they be addressed in future work?

10. Pre-training models are suggested to boost performance going forward. Can you elaborate on how techniques like transfer learning can help low-resource speech translation for Fongbe?
