# [Purified and Unified Steganographic Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural network (DNN) based steganographic schemes require transmitting large steganographic networks (encoding and decoding networks) to the sender and receiver to facilitate covert communication. 
- It is challenging to covertly and effectively transmit these networks without raising suspicion.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Purified and Unified Steganographic Network (PUSNet) that performs an ordinary machine learning task but can be triggered into steganographic networks using keys.
- Formulate the PUSNet construction as a sparse weight filling problem - PUSNet-P is a sparse network that performs image denoising. It can be triggered into PUSNet-E (encoding) and PUSNet-D (decoding) by filling sparse weights using sender/receiver keys.

Main Contributions:
- Propose the novel concept of concealing both encoding and decoding steganographic networks into a single purified network that performs an ordinary task.
- Design a key-based sparse weight filling strategy to flexibly switch between purified and steganographic networks without needing side information.
- Instantiate PUSNet as an image denoiser that can be triggered into secret image encoder and decoder. Experiments show it achieves good performance on all tasks.
- Demonstrate that PUSNet can imperceptibly transmit steganographic networks through public channels by concealing them in a purified network.

In summary, the paper tackles the challenge of covertly transmitting steganographic networks by proposing PUSNet, which conceals secret encoding and decoding networks within a purified network. This allows covertly sharing steganographic tools to facilitate secret communication between parties without raising suspicion.
