# [Eigen Is All You Need: Efficient Lidar-Inertial Continuous-Time Odometry   with Internal Association](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02337)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Continuous-time lidar-inertial odometry (CT-LIO) has emerged as a new paradigm for lidar-based motion estimation systems. By formulating the state estimates directly at the sensor sampling times, CT-LIO methods can better capture vehicle dynamics compared to traditional discrete-time approaches. However, existing CT-LIO methods have not adequately addressed computational efficiency, struggling with real-time performance. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes SLICT2, an efficient real-time CT-LIO system. The key insight is that CT-LIO can be optimized with just a few iterations using a linear solver, instead of commonly used nonlinear solvers that require more iterations. Based on this, SLICT2 implements a customized incremental solver using the Eigen library and performs feature-to-map association between iterations in a solve-associate-solve loop. This allows convergence within 2-3 iterations.

Main Contributions:

1) An efficient real-time CT-LIO pipeline requiring only a few iterations, based on Eigen's linear solver and internal feature association.

2) Detailed formulation of residual and Jacobian calculations for lidar and IMU factors over B-spline control points, enabling computational efficiency.  

3) Extensive experiments demonstrating SLICT2's competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art CT-LIO methods, while achieving up to 8x speedup. Thorough time expenditure analysis provided.

4) Open-sourced implementation to benefit the community.

In summary, SLICT2 makes a strong case for more efficient CT-LIO system design by showing a basic yet fast incremental solver with internal association is sufficient, outperforming conventional wisdom of needing complex nonlinear solvers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes SLICT2, an efficient continuous-time lidar-inertial odometry system that achieves real-time performance and competitive accuracy through a customized solver with just a few iterations and internal feature association between iterations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of SLICT2 are:

1. An efficient real-time CT-LIO pipeline with few iterations based on a linear solver from the Eigen library and internal feature-to-map association applied between each iteration.

2. A detailed local-to-global formulation of the residual and Jacobian of the lidar and IMU factors over the B-spline control points, which is crucial for the computational efficiency of SLICT2. 

3. Extensive experiments and analysis to demonstrate the competitive performance of SLICT2 over state-of-the-art CT-LIO methods, with an in-depth investigation into the time expenditures of the sub-processes. 

In summary, the key innovation is the use of a simple yet efficient optimization approach with just a few iterations, eliminating many computational overheads compared to conventional nonlinear least squares solvers. This allows real-time performance even with a high density of control points and lidar factors. The competitive accuracy is further enhanced by the internal feature-to-map association step.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that CT-LIO benefits more from correct association than number of iterations. Can you expand more on why this is the case? What is the impact of wrong associations on the optimization process?

2. One key innovation mentioned is the use of a simple linear solver instead of a nonlinear least squares solver. Can you explain in more detail the limitations of nonlinear solvers like Ceres that motivated this design choice? 

3. The paper compares performance against several state-of-the-art methods. Based on the results, what are the key strengths and weaknesses of the proposed SLICT2 method? Where does it perform best and worst compared to other approaches?

4. The ablation study shows that re-association in the inner loop improves accuracy. However, it also increases computation time. How can the tradeoff between accuracy and speed for the association process be optimized or improved? 

5. The B-spline trajectory representation is mentioned to have several advantages over piecewise linear interpolation. Can you expand on 1-2 of these advantages and explain the intuition and mechanism behind them?

6. One limitation of the method is that the global map is still used for data association. How can the approach be extended to work in a fully sliding window, mapless setting? What changes would need to be made?

7. The residual and Jacobian calculations are performed in parallel. What is the theoretical speedup possible with additional parallelization over more CPU cores? Is there a ceiling at some point?

8. How does the spline order setting affect accuracy and speed? What are some principles to guide selection of this parameter?

9. The method currently works with lidar and IMU sensors. What changes would be needed to incorporate other sensors like cameras? What are some challenges for multi-modal sensor fusion?

10. The key results are demonstrated on aerial datasets. How do you expect the performance to change in ground vehicles or handheld settings? Would any modifications be needed to adapt the system?
