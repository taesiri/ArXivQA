# [Improving Communication Efficiency of Federated Distillation via   Accumulating Local Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04166)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel technique called ALU to improve the communication efficiency of federated distillation without compromising model accuracy. ALU works by accumulating multiple rounds of local model updates on clients before transmitting the knowledge to the central server. This allows for less frequent but more informative knowledge exchange between clients and server. Experiments on MNIST dataset demonstrate that integrating ALU into existing federated distillation methods like FedCache can drastically reduce communication overhead during training while preserving final model performance. For example, with ALU, FedCache achieves much higher average model accuracy per unit of communication, indicating enhanced efficiency of transmitted information. The proposed ALU allows flexible integration with state-of-the-art federated distillation approaches, while still upholding inherent benefits like privacy protection and model heterogeneity. In summary, ALU is an effective and lightweight technique to boost communication efficiency of federated distillation through accumulating local updates and de-frequencing client-server communication.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a novel technique called ALU to improve the communication efficiency of federated distillation by accumulating multiple rounds of local updates on clients before transferring knowledge to the central server, which reduces the frequency of communication without compromising model accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel technique called ALU (Accumulating Local Updates) to improve the communication efficiency of federated distillation without compromising model accuracy. Specifically, ALU allows accumulating multiple rounds of local model updates on clients before transmitting the knowledge to the server. This reduces the frequency of communication and thus significantly decreases the communication overhead during federated distillation training. As stated in the introduction:

"In this paper, we propose a novel technique, ALU, to improve the communication efficiency of federated distillation without compromising model accuracy. The essence of ALU is to delay the transmission of knowledge in federated distillation until multiple rounds of local model updates are accumulated on the client side, after which a single round of more informative knowledge is transmitted and received to and from the server."

So in summary, the key innovation is using ALU to reduce communication frequency in federated distillation while preserving accuracy, thereby enhancing communication efficiency.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Federated learning enables training machine learning models across decentralized data while preserving data privacy. However, standard federated learning methods like FedAvg require frequently transmitting large model parameters between clients and server, incurring substantial communication overhead. Federated distillation is proposed to improve communication efficiency by only exchanging compact knowledge during training. But further enhancement on communication efficiency is needed by reducing the frequency of knowledge transfer.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel technique called ALU (Accumulating Local Updates) to improve the communication efficiency of federated distillation without compromising accuracy. The key idea is to accumulate multiple rounds of local model updates on clients before transmitting the knowledge to the server. This reduces overall communication frequency while enabling more informative knowledge transfer in each round. 

Specifically, ALU incorporates a hyperparameter s to control the number of local update rounds before communication. In each round, clients optimize models using both standard cross-entropy loss on local data and distillation loss over the latest downloaded global knowledge from the server. The knowledge transmission is delayed until the current round reaches an integer multiple of s. Therefore, ALU allows accumulating informative local updates and de-frequencing communication.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes ALU, the first technique to improve communication efficiency of federated distillation by reducing communication frequency
- ALU can be flexibly integrated with various federated distillation methods like FedCache, FedICT, etc.
- Experiments show ALU drastically improves communication efficiency measured by accuracy per unit of communication, without compromising final accuracy
- Preserves inherent benefits of federated distillation like privacy protection, model heterogeneity, etc.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in designing a lightweight yet effective technique called ALU to further push the communication efficiency boundaries of federated distillation.
