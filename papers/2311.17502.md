# [Enhancing Answer Selection in Community Question Answering with   Pre-trained and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17502)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposed two main approaches for improving answer selection in community question answering systems. The first utilizes pre-trained language models like BERT and a question-answer cross attention network (QAN) architecture to capture contextual features and interactions between questions and answers. QAN outperformed other baseline models on SemEval datasets for answer selection. 

The second approach explores using large language models (LLMs) for answer selection, specifically by generating external knowledge using Llama to augment the questions and answers. This knowledge augmentation improved the accuracy of the LLM in selecting correct answers. Additionally, optimizing the prompt given to the LLM, such as in terms of length or positioning of the question/answers, further enhanced performance. Prompt optimization enabled the LLM to correctly select answers for more questions. 

Overall, the authors demonstrate that both pre-trained models with cross attention mechanisms and knowledge augmentation with prompt optimization for large language models can enhance answer selection. On the PLM side, modeling semantics and question-answer interactions proves effective. For LLMs, external knowledge and careful prompt engineering to provide clearer instructions and context are shown to meaningfully improve answer selection accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Question-Answer Cross Attention Network (QAN) model using pre-trained BERT for answer selection in Community QA, and also explores using a large language model with knowledge augmentation and prompt optimization for the answer selection task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose QAN, a Question-Answer Cross Attention Network with pre-trained models for answer selection in community question answering (CQA). QAN utilizes BERT for encoding and cross attention between questions and answers to capture interactive information. Experiments show QAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on two CQA datasets.

2. The authors incorporate a large language model (LLM) for answer selection with knowledge augmentation. They use Llama-7b-hf to generate external knowledge from questions and answers to enhance the answer selection performance. 

3. The authors optimize the prompt for the LLM in different aspects - prompt length, position of questions/answers, question subject, position of task description. Prompt optimization helps improve the accuracy of the LLM in selecting correct answers to more questions.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) Proposing QAN that leverages BERT and cross attention for answer selection (2) Using LLM for answer selection with knowledge augmentation (3) Optimizing prompts for the LLM to improve performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using BERT for encoding words in the question and answer. What were some of the key considerations and tradeoffs when selecting BERT over other encoding models like ELMo or GloVe? 

2. Cross attention is utilized between the question subject, question body, and answers. What are some of the advantages of using cross attention here compared to alternatives like self-attention or co-attention?

3. The interaction and prediction layer uses bidirectional GRUs to acquire context information between questions and answers. Why was GRU chosen here over other RNN options? What are some weaknesses of this approach?

4. Max pooling and mean pooling are used on the questions and answers before concatenation. What is the motivation behind using two different pooling operations? What information does each one capture? 

5. The paper shows state-of-the-art results on two datasets. What additional experiments could be run to further validate the robustness of the model, such as testing on out-of-domain data?

6. Ablation studies are performed by removing different components of the full model. What other ablation experiments could give further insight into the contribution of each module?

7. The model accuracy drops when questions subjects and bodies are not encoded separately. Why does this joint encoding hurt performance? How could the model be altered to support both joint and separate encoding?

8. Knowledge augmentation using LLMs improves answer selection accuracy. However, the quality of generated knowledge varies. What steps could be taken to ensure higher quality or relevant knowledge is obtained? 

9. Prompt optimization is performed to improve LLM answer selection. What other prompt optimization techniques should be explored? How can the prompts be further tailored to this task?

10. The LLM answer selection is framed as a single correct answer task. How would the approach differ if instead it was a classification task across multiple candidate answers like the original BERT-based model?
