## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a new calibration system and algorithm for micro scanning mirrors (MSMs) with three degrees of freedom - two rotational motions and one translational motion. The authors design a minimal rig using two laser beams reflected off the MSM onto a calibration target, along with a triaxial Hall effect sensor for feedback. They develop a calibration algorithm that employs the reflection principles to precisely estimate the 3D pose of the MSM over time. To map between the estimated MSM poses and Hall sensor readings, they propose a self-synchronizing periodicity-based model fitting approach. Through experiments, they achieve high accuracy in estimating the MSM's angles (0.020 degrees standard deviation) using their rig and algorithm. The work helps advance the development of MSM-based sensors by enabling precise calibration of the mirror motions, which is useful for applications like LiDAR systems and laser projectors. Their novel system Only requires two laser sources, reducing hardware costs compared to other calibration methods.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new calibration system and algorithm for measuring the 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion of a micro scanning mirror (MSM). The system uses a minimal 2-laser beam approach to reduce cost while still allowing accurate estimation of the mirror's rotations and out-of-plane translation. It employs a camera to observe the motion of the laser dots reflected by the mirror during resonant scanning. The paper derives calibration algorithms that incorporate the reflection principles to precisely estimate the MSM's pose, defined by two rotation angles and one translation value. It also proposes a self-synchronizing technique to establish a mapping between the measured MSM poses and the readings from an integrated triaxial Hall effect sensor. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can achieve high accuracy in estimating the MSM's 3-DOF motion, with a pose estimation error of 0.02 degrees and 0.011 degrees standard deviation. The system provides an effective calibration solution for MSMs used in applications like LiDARs and laser projectors.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The authors present a new calibration system and algorithm design for micro scanning mirrors, which uses a minimal 2-laser beam approach and builds on reflection principles to precisely measure the 3 degree-of-freedom poses of a soft-hinged micro scanning mirror with triaxial Hall effect sensor feedback.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper focuses on the calibration of a 3 degree-of-freedom (3-DoF) micro scanning mirror (MSM) with a triaxial Hall effect sensor. The key research questions/goals are:

1) How to design a calibration system to accurately measure the 3-DoF motion (2 rotations and 1 translation) of a MSM during dynamic operation?

2) How to establish the mapping between the triaxial Hall effect sensor readings and the estimated 3-DoF MSM poses?

Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) A minimal 2-laser beam calibration approach assisted by two checkerboard planes to estimate the 3-DoF MSM poses.

2) A self-synchronizing periodicity-based model fitting method to calibrate the mapping between the triaxial Hall effect sensor readings and the estimated MSM poses. 

The central hypothesis is that by using the proposed calibration system design and calibration algorithms, accurate measurement and modeling of the 3-DoF motions of a dynamically-operated MSM with a triaxial Hall effect sensor can be achieved.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A new calibration system design for micro scanning mirrors (MSMs) using a minimal 2-laser beam approach. This reduces hardware cost compared to existing methods.

2) A new calibration algorithm that builds on the reflection principle to precisely estimate the 3 degree-of-freedom (DoF) poses of the MSM, including 2 rotational motions and 1 out-of-plane translation. Prior works focused more on 2 DoF rotational motions. 

3) A self-synchronizing periodicity-based model fitting approach to establish the mapping between triaxial Hall sensor readings and estimated MSM poses. This handles the nonlinear relationship and time synchronization between the two signals.

4) Extensive experiments validating the new calibration system and algorithms, achieving high accuracy in estimating MSM poses (0.02 degrees) from camera measurements.

In summary, the key innovation is in the design of a lower cost but accurate calibration system and associated algorithms that can estimate hard-to-measure 3 DoF dynamic motions of micro scanning mirrors. This could benefit various applications needing precise control of MSMs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents several notable contributions compared to prior work on micro scanning mirror (MSM) calibration:

1. It proposes a full 3 degree-of-freedom (DoF) motion model for MSMs that includes out-of-plane translation in addition to 2 DoF rotations. This is more comprehensive than existing works that typically only model pure rotational motion. 

2. It develops a minimal 2-laser beam calibration approach that reduces hardware cost compared to methods requiring more lasers or precision optical equipment. The approach builds on reflection geometry principles to estimate the coupled influence of rotation and translation on the laser beam reflections.

3. It presents a self-synchronizing periodicity-based model fitting technique to establish the mapping between triaxial Hall sensor readings and estimated MSM poses. This captures the inherent signal periodicity better than traditional linear mapping models.

4. It implements the calibration system and algorithms on an actual soft-hinged resonant MSM prototype with experimental validation. The results demonstrate high accuracy in estimated MSM poses (0.02 degree) using affordable components.

In summary, this work tackles unique challenges in MSM calibration like small size, dynamic scanning motions, and cost constraints. The proposed techniques, especially the 3 DoF motion modeling and minimal hardware design, advance the state-of-the-art and could enable broader applications of MSMs. The experimental prototypes also represent an important step towards practical deployment.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the conclusion section, the authors suggest two main future research directions:

1) Further explore optimal calibration setup (e.g. incident beam number and spanning angles) for micro scanning mirrors (MSMs). The paper analyzes how the spanning angle between the incident laser beams affects the uncertainty of the mirror plane estimation. Exploring the optimal configurations would help improve the calibration accuracy. 

2) Calibrate MSMs with different sensory feedback methods. The current work focuses on an MSM with a triaxial Hall effect sensor. The authors suggest extending the calibration approach to other types of feedback sensors used with MSMs. New results from calibrating different MSM setups will be reported in future publications.

In summary, the main future work suggested is to optimize the calibration setup specifically for MSMs, and generalize the calibration system and algorithms to work with different sensory feedback methods used with MSMs.
