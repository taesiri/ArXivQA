# [Achieving Near-Optimal Regret for Bandit Algorithms with Uniform   Last-Iterate Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12711)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing bandit algorithm performance measures like regret, PAC bounds, or uniform-PAC evaluate the cumulative performance over time, but allow the algorithm to play arbitrarily bad arms at any given time step. This behavior can be problematic for applications like clinical trials where bad treatments at any point are unacceptable. 

Solution:
The paper introduces a new performance measure called the uniform last-iterate (ULI) guarantee that ensures the per-round regret is bounded by a monotonically decreasing function of time. This prevents revisiting bad arms when sufficient samples are available.

Key Contributions:

1. Introduces the ULI performance measure that captures both cumulative long-term performance and per-round instantaneous performance of bandit algorithms. Shows ULI directly implies good uniform-PAC and regret guarantees.

2. Shows many elimination-based algorithms already achieve near-optimal ULI guarantees with minor analysis changes. Also provides a meta-algorithm that enables many adversarial bandits algorithms to attain ULI.

3. Proves optimistic algorithms like UCB cannot achieve near-optimal ULI, exhibiting a limitation. Their per-round regret converges slower than elimination methods.

4. Proposes an efficient linear bandit algorithm for infinite arm spaces that attains ULI guarantee by using a novel adaptive barycentric spanner technique and only requires polynomial optimization oracle queries.

In summary, the paper identifies a limitation of existing bandit measures in capturing instantaneous performance, proposes the stronger ULI measure, demonstrates when it is achievable, and provides both positive and negative algorithmic results. The adaptive spanner method also enables computationally efficient infinite arm algorithms.
