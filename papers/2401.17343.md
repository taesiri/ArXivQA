# [YTCommentQA: Video Question Answerability in Instructional Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17343)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Instructional videos provide detailed how-to guides for various tasks, with viewers often asking questions to clarify or adapt the content. Providing answers is important but difficult to do promptly. 
- Existing video QA models are trained on questions crafted based on video content. But real-world user questions can go beyond what's answerable in the video.
- Determining if a question can be answered from the video is challenging due to the multi-modal nature of videos (intertwined visual and verbal information).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present the YTCommentQA dataset containing 2,332 naturally generated YouTube comment questions on 2,004 videos.
- The questions are categorized by their answerability within the video and the modality required to answer: visuals, script, or both. 
- Two tasks are introduced: Segment Answerability Classification and Video Answerability Classification, which require predicting answerability given a segment or full video.

Key Contributions:
- First video QA dataset with natural questions from real users and answerability annotations.
- Answerability taxonomy accounting for required modality (visual, script, both). 
- Benchmark tasks to spur research on understanding role of multi-modality for video question answerability.

The paper highlights the need to determine if a video question is answerable, while understanding the complementary roles visual and verbal information play in videos. The natural questions and answerability annotations enable developing more reliable video QA systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the YTCommentQA dataset containing naturally generated YouTube comments with answerability annotations, designed to foster research on determining whether a video can answer a given question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the YTCommentQA dataset for video question answerability. Specifically:

1) YTCommentQA contains 2,332 naturally occurring questions collected from YouTube comments on instructional videos, along with annotations on whether each question is answerable from the video content. 

2) The questions are categorized based on whether they require visual information, script/transcript information, both modalities, or are unanswerable, in order to be answered.

3) Experiments demonstrate the complexity of determining question answerability in videos, especially with regards to understanding the complementary roles played by the visual and verbal modalities.

4) The paper argues that being able to discern answerability is important for developing reliable video question answering systems that can identify when additional information is needed beyond what is contained in the video.

In summary, the key contribution is a new dataset that focuses research on video question answerability through naturally occurring questions, fine-grained answerability types, and analysis that highlights the need for multimodal understanding.

The paper introduces a new dataset called YTCommentQA for video question answerability in instructional videos. It contains naturally occurring questions asked by YouTube users in video comments, along with annotations for whether the questions are answerable from the video content. The questions are categorized by the modality (visual, script, or both) required to answer them. The paper also defines annotation procedures and answerability classification tasks on this dataset. The key goal is to study video question answerability and the role of multi-modality in answering questions that originate from real-world settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How did the authors create the video and question collection pipelines to gather a diverse and natural range of questions from real YouTube users? What filtering criteria did they use?

2. What motivated the authors to have both visual and script answerability types in the annotation process? Why was it important to differentiate between questions that require only visuals, only scripts, or both? 

3. The paper mentions using off-the-shelf models for punctuating transcripts and extracting text from visuals. How might the errors from these models have propagated and impacted downstream answerability annotation?

4. Why did the authors opt for a two-step annotation process involving both timestamp verification and modality-specific answerability? What are the tradeoffs with a single-step process?

5. How might the authors have accounted for potential biases, inaccuracies or inconsistencies among crowdworker annotations? Did they analyze inter-annotator agreement?

6. For the video answerability task, how did the authors handle the challenge of lengthy videos exceeding transformers' context capacities? What are other potential approaches?

7. The paper benchmarks performance for both language models and multimodal models. Based on the results, why might the multimodal models have not outperformed language-only models?

8. How feasible would it be to scale up dataset collection and annotation to support even longer, more complex instructional videos? Would the proposed methodology still be practical?

9. The paper focuses on classifying existing questions, but can the dataset support question generation as well? What modifications would be needed?

10. Beyond answering existing questions, how could the authors' answerability dataset aid the community in creating QA agents that can meaningfully engage users through dialogue?
