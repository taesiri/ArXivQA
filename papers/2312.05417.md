# [ESPN: Memory-Efficient Multi-Vector Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05417)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-vector neural IR models like ColBERT achieve higher retrieval quality but have massive index sizes, 26-34x larger than lexical models like BM25. This poses scalability challenges.
- Storing indices in memory provides fast retrieval but is expensive to scale. Using mmap or swap space for larger datasets introduces software overheads and high query latencies.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose ESPN, which offloads the entire re-ranking embedding tables to SSDs, reducing memory requirements by 5-16x. 
- They use GPUDirect Storage for direct SSD-to-GPU transfers.
- A novel approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) based prefetcher is designed which achieves >90% hit rates. It overlaps SSD reads with ANN search computation.  
- An early re-ranking stage ranks prefetched embeddings to further reduce query latency.

Main Contributions:
1. ESPN reduces memory footprint of multi-vector models to be only 1.6x that of BM25, improving scalability.
2. The prefetcher improves SSD retrieval latency by 3.9-6.4x and maintains near memory-level query latencies.
3. Bandwidth efficient partial re-ranking enables ESPN to handle large query batch sizes with marginal 0.3-0.7% quality loss.
4. ESPN achieves 3.1-3.9x faster query latency than mmap near memory capacity and is scalable to larger datasets.

In summary, ESPN enables memory-efficient and scalable inference for multi-vector neural IR models by offloading indices to SSDs and using novel prefetching strategies to accelerate storage access.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a system called ESPN that offloads multi-vector embeddings to SSDs and employs prefetching techniques to reduce memory footprint by up to 16x while accelerating storage access to maintain fast query speeds for neural information retrieval systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a system called Embedding from Storage Pipelined Network (ESPN) to enable efficient and scalable inference for neural multi-vector information retrieval models. Specifically, ESPN has the following key aspects:

1. It offloads the entire re-ranking embedding tables to SSDs, reducing the memory requirements by 5-16x compared to caching everything in memory. This allows the system to scale to larger datasets.

2. It introduces a novel approximate nearest neighbor based prefetcher that achieves hit rates exceeding 90%. This prefetching mechanism hides the latency of accessing embeddings from SSDs. 

3. Combined with optimizations like direct GPU memory access and early re-ranking, ESPN maintains near memory level query latencies and throughput for both single queries and small batch sizes. 

4. It explores bandwidth efficient partial re-ranking solutions that allow ESPN to handle much larger batch sizes with marginal impact on retrieval quality.

In summary, ESPN enables scaling multi-vector neural IR models to large datasets while retaining high query throughput and low latency, reducing memory requirements, and accelerating storage access. This is achieved through a combination of software prefetching, GPU optimizations, and query optimizations.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Multi-vector information retrieval - The paper focuses on neural information retrieval models that encode documents into multi-vector representations at the granularity of tokens rather than a single vector.

- Index size - The index size of multi-vector models can be orders of magnitude larger than traditional lexical models, posing scalability challenges. 

- Memory footprint - The large memory footprint required to store the indices for fast retrieval is a key challenge addressed in the paper.

- Solid state drives (SSDs) - The paper investigates using SSDs to store the large embedding tables and index to reduce memory requirements.

- GPUDirect Storage - The paper utilizes Nvidia's GPUDirect Storage APIs for direct and asynchronous data transfers between SSD and GPU memory.

- Software prefetching - A key contribution is an approximate nearest neighbor based prefetcher to overlap SSD latency with computation.

- Early reranking - Overlapping SSD reads with early reranking of prefetched embeddings is proposed to hide SSD latency.

- Partial reranking - Evaluated as a bandwidth efficient solution to improve scalability to larger batch sizes.

- Latency, throughput, hit rates - Key metrics used to evaluate the system performance.

The core ideas focus on using SSDs and software optimizations like prefetching to build a scalable and low latency multi-vector neural IR system with reduced memory needs.
