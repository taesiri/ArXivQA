# [Quantitative Metrics for Benchmarking Medical Image Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical images acquired using different scanners/protocols exhibit domain shifts that reduce performance of AI models. 
- Image harmonization is used to address this but lacks standard quantitative metrics to benchmark performance.
- Existing metrics require ground truth images which are often unavailable in real scenarios.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose two novel metrics to measure intensity harmonization without needing ground truth:
    - Normalized Wasserstein Distance between input/predicted (nWD(i,p)) 
    - Normalized Wasserstein Distance between target/predicted (nWD(t,p))
- Propose anatomy preservation metric (AP) to measure anatomical changes using segmentation.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce interpretable metrics nWD and AP to quantify intensity harmonization and anatomical preservation without ground truth.
- Demonstrate strong correlation between proposed and established IQA metrics needing ground truth.
- Show improved harmonization for model retrained on dataset vs pre-trained model.
- Establish reference values for metric interpretations - higher nWD(i,p) and AP closer to 1 indicate better harmonization.

In summary, this paper presents new quantitative evaluation metrics for medical image harmonization to benchmark performance without requiring unavailable ground truth images. Detailed experiments demonstrate correlation with existing metrics and ability to assess harmonization quality in the absence of gold standards.
