# [EIGER IV: The cool 10$^4$K circumgalactic environment of high-$z$   galaxies reveals remarkably efficient IGM enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1273)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: What is the nature and extent of cool circumgalactic gas, as traced by Mg II absorption, around high-redshift galaxies at z~2-6?Specifically, the authors aim to characterize the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) of high-redshift galaxies using Mg II absorption detected in the spectrum of a background quasar. They want to understand the radial extent of cool gas around galaxies, its dependence on galaxy properties like stellar mass and star formation rate, and whether this gas is gravitationally bound or escaping the galaxies. This will provide insights into galaxy fueling, feedback, and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium at early cosmic times.The key hypotheses are:1) Mg II absorption arises in cool (T~10^4 K) gas around galaxies, and can be used to trace the CGM. 2) The extent and strength of Mg II absorption depends on galaxy mass and star formation, similar to what is seen at lower redshifts.3) Much of the cool CGM gas is not gravitationally bound at high redshift, indicating more efficient enrichment of the IGM.By observing Mg II absorption around a sample of galaxies at z~2-6 with JWST, the authors aim to test these hypotheses about the high-z CGM and its role in galaxy evolution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It presents the first observations characterizing the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) around high-redshift (z=2.3-6.3) galaxies using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy. - It identifies 7 Mg II absorption systems associated with galaxies within 300 kpc of the quasar J0100+2802 sightline. - It finds that the Mg II absorption strength declines steeply with impact parameter, extending out to 2-3 R200 of the host galaxies. - It shows that 5 out of 7 Mg II systems are not gravitationally bound to their host galaxies, based on their large radial separations (R > 1.3 R200) and high velocity offsets from the host galaxies. This suggests the CGM is remarkably efficient at enriching the IGM at high redshifts.- This is in contrast to low-z galaxies where most cool CGM gas is bound. This indicates evolution in CGM kinematics from early universe to today.- The two strongest Mg II systems are detected in proto-groups at z~4.2 and 4.5, indicating cool Mg II absorption may trace intra-group gas at high redshifts.In summary, this work demonstrates the power of JWST to study the CGM of high-z galaxies and reveals the CGM is remarkably unbound compared to low redshifts, indicating highly efficient IGM enrichment in the early universe.
