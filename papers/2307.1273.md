# [EIGER IV: The cool 10$^4$K circumgalactic environment of high-$z$   galaxies reveals remarkably efficient IGM enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1273)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: What is the nature and extent of cool circumgalactic gas, as traced by Mg II absorption, around high-redshift galaxies at z~2-6?

Specifically, the authors aim to characterize the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) of high-redshift galaxies using Mg II absorption detected in the spectrum of a background quasar. They want to understand the radial extent of cool gas around galaxies, its dependence on galaxy properties like stellar mass and star formation rate, and whether this gas is gravitationally bound or escaping the galaxies. This will provide insights into galaxy fueling, feedback, and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium at early cosmic times.

The key hypotheses are:

1) Mg II absorption arises in cool (T~10^4 K) gas around galaxies, and can be used to trace the CGM. 

2) The extent and strength of Mg II absorption depends on galaxy mass and star formation, similar to what is seen at lower redshifts.

3) Much of the cool CGM gas is not gravitationally bound at high redshift, indicating more efficient enrichment of the IGM.

By observing Mg II absorption around a sample of galaxies at z~2-6 with JWST, the authors aim to test these hypotheses about the high-z CGM and its role in galaxy evolution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It presents the first observations characterizing the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) around high-redshift (z=2.3-6.3) galaxies using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy. 

- It identifies 7 Mg II absorption systems associated with galaxies within 300 kpc of the quasar J0100+2802 sightline. 

- It finds that the Mg II absorption strength declines steeply with impact parameter, extending out to 2-3 R200 of the host galaxies. 

- It shows that 5 out of 7 Mg II systems are not gravitationally bound to their host galaxies, based on their large radial separations (R > 1.3 R200) and high velocity offsets from the host galaxies. This suggests the CGM is remarkably efficient at enriching the IGM at high redshifts.

- This is in contrast to low-z galaxies where most cool CGM gas is bound. This indicates evolution in CGM kinematics from early universe to today.

- The two strongest Mg II systems are detected in proto-groups at z~4.2 and 4.5, indicating cool Mg II absorption may trace intra-group gas at high redshifts.

In summary, this work demonstrates the power of JWST to study the CGM of high-z galaxies and reveals the CGM is remarkably unbound compared to low redshifts, indicating highly efficient IGM enrichment in the early universe.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main finding from the paper:

The paper presents the first observations of cool, metal-enriched gas traced by magnesium absorption around high-redshift galaxies at the end of reionization, indicating galaxies were remarkably efficient at dispersing metals into the surrounding intergalactic medium in the early universe.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on high-redshift galaxies and their circumgalactic medium (CGM):

- This paper presents some of the first results on the CGM of high-redshift (z~2-6) galaxies using JWST spectroscopy. Most previous CGM studies have focused on lower redshifts z<1. So this provides an exciting new window into early galaxy growth.

- The study finds evidence that much of the CGM gas around these galaxies is not bound to their host dark matter halos, in contrast to CGM at z<1 which is typically bound. This suggests the CGM was more extended and galaxies were more efficient at enriching their surroundings early on. 

- It identifies cool CGM gas traced by MgII absorption around 29 galaxies between z=2.3-6.3. Most previous MgII studies at these redshifts probed absorption systems without identified galaxy counterparts. Connecting absorbers to galaxies provides more physical context.

- The galaxy sample spans a wide range in stellar mass and star formation rates, allowing some investigation of CGM trends with these properties. This is similar to other works correlating CGM absorption with galaxy properties.

- Two proto-group environments are identified at z>4 associated with strong MgII absorption. Studying early intragroup gas is novel compared to most CGM studies focused on isolated galaxies.

- JWST's sensitivity enables emission line galaxy detection down to lower masses than typically feasible at these redshifts. But the sample is still biased to more massive galaxies relative to the overall population.

So in summary, this study represents an important early step in applying JWST's capabilities to push CGM studies to higher redshifts and connect to emerging galaxy properties. The findings suggest some evolution in CGM properties compared to later times. Expanding the samples will be important for robust trends.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Expanding the EIGER survey to additional quasar fields beyond J0100+2802. The authors note they will extend this work to the full six quasar fields of the EIGER survey in an upcoming study. This will allow them to better quantify CGM-galaxy correlations over a larger sample.

- Performing a complete "galaxy centric" analysis of the EIGER survey to characterize the CGM covering fraction and metal mass budget around the full galaxy sample. The current study focused only on galaxies near identified absorbers, but a blind search is needed. 

- Further characterizing high-ionization metal absorption systems like CIV and OI in the EIGER survey. The authors mention an upcoming study focused on the properties of CIV absorbers in particular.

- Pushing to fainter emission line fluxes and lower mass galaxies by incorporating additional JWST spectroscopy and ground-based follow-up. The current study was limited to galaxies with emission line SNR > 7, but going deeper will allow detection of fainter hosts.

- Exploring the evolution of the kinematics, enrichment, and physical conditions in the CGM from the EoR to present day. The differences found between high-z and low-z CGM in this study warrant further investigation.

- Connecting CGM properties to galaxy morphology and star formation at high redshift, like has been done at low-z. The high-resolution JWST imaging enables such morphological analysis.

- Better understanding the relation between CGM absorption and environment, especially gravitationally bound gas in overdense regions. More work is needed to confirm if absorption prefers proto-group galaxies.

In summary, the authors call for expanding the sample, pushing to lower galaxy masses, characterizing the CGM in absorption lines besides MgII, connecting CGM to galaxy properties, and studying its relation to environment, among other future directions. The EIGER survey data will enable progress in addressing many of these open questions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents observations of cool circumgalactic gas traced by MgII absorption around 29 high-redshift (z=2.3-6.3) galaxies using new JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy. The galaxies span a wide range in stellar mass and star formation rates. MgII absorption is detected extending out to about 2-3 virial radii for 7 galaxies, with non-detections around 12 galaxies suggesting patchy absorption. The strongest absorbers are found near the most massive, star forming galaxies. The MgII gas kinematics show large offsets from systemic velocities, with 5/7 systems likely unbound from galaxy halos, in contrast to low redshift where most cool CGM is bound. This suggests the CGM is remarkably efficient at enriching the IGM at high z. The two strongest absorbers are near galaxy overdensities/proto-groups at z~4.2 and 4.5, with complex kinematics that may trace enriched intragroup gas. Overall, this work demonstrates JWST's ability to study circumgalactic gas around early galaxies.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents observations of the cool circumgalactic gas around 29 high-redshift galaxies ($2.3<z<6.3$) using deep near-infrared spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope. The galaxies span a wide range in stellar mass and star formation rates. The authors identify 7 Mg II absorption systems within 300 kpc of the background quasar sightline that are associated with foreground galaxies. They find that the Mg II absorption strength declines sharply with impact parameter, extending out to 2-3 times the virial radius of the host galaxies. The majority of absorbers are found around massive, star-forming galaxies. 

A key result is that the kinematics of the Mg II absorbers indicate that most of the cool circumgalactic gas is not gravitationally bound to the dark matter halos of the galaxies at these redshifts, unlike at lower redshifts (z<1) where the gas is primarily bound. This suggests that at early times, galaxies were efficient at ejecting enriched gas into the intergalactic medium. Only the two strongest Mg II systems associated with galaxy overdensities appear consistent with being bound. The results demonstrate the power of JWST to probe galaxy ecosystem at early cosmic times.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents observations of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) around high-redshift galaxies using the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The authors performed near-infrared slitless grism spectroscopy with JWST/NIRCam around 29 galaxies at redshifts 2.3<z<6.3 near the sightline to the quasar J0100+2802. They identified 7 MgII absorption systems associated with these galaxies within 300 kpc and used the MgII absorption strength and kinematics to characterize the CGM. They measured galaxy properties like stellar mass, star formation rate, and size from emission lines in the grism data and broad-band JWST photometry. Comparing the MgII absorption and galaxy properties, they find that most of the absorption is not bound to the galaxy halos, unlike the low-redshift CGM. This suggests the high-z galaxies are efficiently enriching their surroundings. The paper demonstrates JWST's capabilities for galaxy spectroscopy and CGM studies in the reionization era.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting observations of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) around 29 high-redshift (z=2.3-6.3) galaxies using new JWST spectroscopy. The goal is to characterize the properties and evolution of the CGM from the early universe to the present day. Some key points:

- They use JWST NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy to observe galaxies around the z=6.33 quasar J0100+2802, detecting galaxies over redshifts 2.3-6.3. 

- They identify 7 MgII absorption systems associated with these galaxies within 300 kpc of the quasar sightline. 

- The MgII absorption is detected out to large impact parameters, 2-3 times the virial radius R200 of the galaxies. This extent is larger than typically seen around lower redshift galaxies.

- The MgII absorption kinematics are offset from the systemic galaxy redshifts, suggesting most of the gas is not bound to the galaxies. This differs from lower redshifts where MgII gas appears bound.

- The two strongest MgII systems are associated with galaxy overdensities or "proto-groups", and have gas kinematics consistent with being bound.

- They conclude that galaxies at z>4 are efficiently enriching their circumgalactic gas and intergalactic medium, unlike galaxies at lower redshifts that retain more of their metal-enriched gas.

So in summary, the paper is using JWST to characterize the properties and evolution of the CGM around galaxies over cosmic time, from the epoch of reionization to the present day. A key finding is the CGM gas at higher redshifts appears more extended, enriched, and unbound compared to lower redshifts.
