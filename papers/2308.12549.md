# [Synchronize Feature Extracting and Matching: A Single Branch Framework   for 3D Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12549)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can feature extracting and matching be conducted simultaneously in a simple way for 3D LiDAR single object tracking?The authors propose that the answer is yes, and they introduce a novel single-branch framework called SyncTrack that synchronizes feature extraction and matching in a single network, without needing separate branches or additional matching modules. The key ideas behind SyncTrack are:- Using a Transformer-based backbone instead of separate Siamese networks, allowing features from the template and search regions to interact directly. - Leveraging the dynamic affinity modeling of the Transformer self-attention to intrinsically perform feature matching while extracting features.- Introducing a novel Attentive Points Sampling module in the Transformer layers to dynamically sample important points based on the attention between template and search regions.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that feature extraction and matching can be synchronized in a simple single-branch network by utilizing properties of the Transformer, avoiding complexities of prior two-branch or two-stage approaches. The SyncTrack framework is proposed to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:- Proposing SyncTrack, a novel single-branch and single-stage framework for 3D LiDAR single object tracking. This replaces the commonly used Siamese network structure with a unified backbone that synchronizes feature extraction and matching.- Introducing Attentive Points-Sampling Transformer (APST) layers to build the backbone. This replaces random/FPS sampling with a learnable attentive sampling strategy to preserve more informative points. - Achieving new state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NuScenes datasets for real-time LiDAR tracking, improving mean results by up to 2.8% and 1.4% respectively.- Providing in-depth analysis on how the Transformer's dynamic affinity enables joint feature learning and relation modeling in a single branch, eliminating the need for a separate matching network.- Demonstrating the efficiency, accuracy and scalability of SyncTrack with extensive experiments and ablations. For example, achieving 45 fps speed with only 1.47M parameters.In summary, the key innovation seems to be proposing a simplified and unified single-branch tracker that synchronizes feature extraction and matching in Transformers via attentive point sampling. This achieves SOTA results while being efficient and scalable.
