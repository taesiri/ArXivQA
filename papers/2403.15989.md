# [Knowledge-guided Machine Learning: Current Trends and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15989)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Knowledge-guided Machine Learning: Current Trends and Future Prospects":

Problem:
- Traditional process-based models in science suffer from imperfections, lack of explainability, and high computational costs. On the other hand, black-box ML models trained solely on limited scientific data fail to generalize and produce scientifically inconsistent results. 

- There is a need for new ML methods that can leverage both scientific data and knowledge to achieve better accuracy, consistency, explainability and efficiency.

Proposed Solution - Knowledge-guided Machine Learning (KGML):

- Integrates scientific knowledge (e.g. physical laws, domain constraints) along with data to guide the learning of ML models. 

- Provides a 3D view to categorize KGML research based on:
   1) Type of knowledge (perfect vs imperfect)
   2) Knowledge-ML integration (ML-centric vs process-centric) 
   3) Method (learning, architecture, pretraining)

- Describes 3 main methods: 
   1) Knowledge-guided learning functions
   2) Knowledge-guided neural architectures
   3) Knowledge-guided pretraining
   
- Discusses major use cases: forward modeling, inverse modeling, generative modeling, downscaling

- Proposes building KGML-based foundation models in environment science for improved generalizability

Main Contributions:

- Provides an accessible overview of the emerging field of KGML for broad audiences
- Categorizes and relates a diverse body of KGML research using a 3D view 
- Describes commonly used techniques for integrating knowledge in ML
- Analyzes use cases and opportunities where KGML is impactful
- Offers research directions for developing KGML foundation models in science

In summary, the paper clearly defines the limitations of existing modeling approaches, proposes the idea of KGML to address these gaps, provides practical methods and use cases, and offers opportunities for impactful future work in this domain.
