# [CAJun: Continuous Adaptive Jumping using a Learned Centroidal Controller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09557)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop a controller that enables legged robots to achieve continuous, long-distance jumping with adaptive distances?

Specifically, the paper aims to develop a control framework that allows quadrupedal robots to:

- Jump continuously over long distances rather than just single jumps
- Adapt the jumping distance based on commands, rather than having fixed distances
- Achieve robust jumping behavior that can be directly deployed on real robots without extensive sim-to-real efforts

To address these challenges, the paper proposes a hierarchical framework called CAJun that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with optimization-based control. The key hypothesis is that this hierarchical approach can leverage the benefits of both learning and optimal control to achieve more adaptive and versatile jumping compared to prior methods.

The experiments then validate this hypothesis by showing that the proposed CAJun framework can enable continuous jumping with distances adapted based on user commands. It also demonstrates a gap crossing ability of 70cm on a real quadruped robot, outperforming prior learning and control methods for jumping.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that combining RL and optimal control hierarchically can achieve more adaptive, continuous long-distance jumping on legged robots. The experiments provide evidence to validate this hypothesis and the capabilities enabled by the CAJun framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the development of a novel hierarchical learning and control framework called CAJun that enables legged robots to achieve continuous and adaptive long-distance jumping. Specifically:

- CAJun consists of a high-level centroidal policy trained with reinforcement learning (RL) and a low-level optimal leg controller. 

- The RL-trained centroidal policy outputs desired gait timing, base velocity, and swing foot position to the leg controller. The leg controller then converts these into motor commands.

- This framework combines the versatility of learning for high-level behaviors with the robustness of optimization-based control for low-level actions. 

- CAJun is shown to enable a quadruped robot to achieve continuous jumping over long distances with the ability to adapt the jumping distance based on commands. 

- The robot can jump across gaps up to 70cm wide using a bounding gait learned with CAJun, allowing it to traverse challenging terrain. 

- The paper shows that policies learned in simulation can be directly transferred to the real robot without fine-tuning.

- CAJun is also highly efficient to train, requiring only 20 minutes on a single GPU.

In summary, the key contribution is the design of the CAJun framework that enables efficient learning and robust control of adaptive, continuous long-distance jumping on legged robots. The results demonstrate improved versatility and traversal capability over challenging terrains.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in legged robot jumping:

- This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework called CAJun for enabling continuous, adaptive long jumps on quadruped robots. The key novelty is combining learning at the high level with optimization-based control at the low level. 

- Compared to other optimization-based jumping controllers (e.g. MPC, WBC), this method can achieve more adaptive and continuous jumping by learning the gait and foot placement online. However, those controllers may be more robust to disturbances due to relying less on learning.

- Compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning methods for jumping, this hierarchical approach leads to better sim-to-real transfer and more sample efficient learning. The low-level controller handles the complex dynamics and contacts.

- For hierarchical RL methods, this paper shows higher jumping capability (70cm gap) than prior works, and faster training due to reformulating the leg force optimization.

- A unique element is learning residual adjustments to a heuristic swing leg trajectory, rather than directly outputting joint targets. This may improve learning stability.

- For sim-to-real transfer, the results are strong like other recent quadruped works using sim-to-real techniques. But there is still room to improve robustness to unseen conditions.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in learned legged jumping by combining the strengths of optimization-based control and hierarchical RL. The framework is amenable to further improvements in adaptive behaviors, sim-to-real transfer, and disturbance rejection. It provides a promising direction for enhancing legged robot versatility.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extending the C-ADAPT framework to incorporate perception and achieve more accurate and autonomous jumping behaviors. The current system can adapt jumping distances based on simple user commands, but does not actually perceive the environment. Incorporating perception would allow the robot to sense terrain features like gaps and adapt its jumps accordingly.

- Enabling the robot to land more precisely at desired locations. Currently, the robot can adjust its jumping distance but lands inaccurately due to factors like unmodeled dynamics and state estimation drift. Improving landing accuracy is an important direction. 

- Exploring more dynamic and agile jumping skills beyond the bounding and pronking gaits presented. The modularity of C-ADAPT could enable learning other explosive behaviors like salto jumps.

- Incorporating exteroceptive sensing into the policy learning process, instead of just relying on proprioception. This could improve robustness and sim-to-real transfer.

- Extending C-ADAPT to 3D jumping behaviors and motions outside the sagittal plane. The current work focuses on planar jumping.

- Reducing the sim-to-real gap further using methods like system identification and domain randomization. While C-ADAPT has relatively small sim-to-real gaps already, reducing it further could improve real-world performance.

- Validating the approach on more dynamic and agile robots beyond the Unitree Go1 quadruped used in the paper.

- Exploring ways to make the training process even faster, to enable quick turnaround times for learning new skills.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents CAJun (Continuous Adaptive Jumping using a learned Centroidal Controller), a hierarchical learning and control framework that enables legged robots to perform continuous, adaptive long-distance jumping. The framework consists of a high-level centroidal policy learned with reinforcement learning (RL) and a low-level optimal control-based leg controller. The centroidal policy outputs desired gait timing, base velocity, and foot positions to the leg controller, while the leg controller tracks these commands using separate swing and stance leg controllers. To enable efficient training, the stance leg force optimization is reformulated as an unconstrained least squares problem with clipping. In experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped, CAJun policies trained in just 20 minutes can directly transfer to the real robot and achieve continuous jumping with distances adaptable based on user commands. The framework also enables gap crossing of up to 70cm, 40% wider than prior methods. The combination of learning and control makes CAJun adaptive while maintaining robustness against perturbations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents CAJun, a novel hierarchical learning and control framework that enables legged robots to jump continuously with adaptive jumping distances. The framework consists of a high-level centroidal policy learned with reinforcement learning (RL) and a low-level model predictive control (MPC) based leg controller. The centroidal policy specifies the gait timing, base velocity, and swing foot position for the leg controller. The leg controller then optimizes motor commands to track the swing foot target and base velocity. To speed up training, the stance leg MPC is reformulated as a least squares problem to be solved efficiently in parallel. 

In experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped, CAJun policies trained in 20 minutes on a single GPU can directly transfer to the real robot with minimal sim-to-real gap. The robot achieves continuous long jumps with adaptive distances based on user command. Using a bounding gait, it can jump across gaps up to 70cm wide, 40% wider than prior methods. Ablation studies validate the hierarchical design and efficient parallel training of CAJun. The combination of versatile learning and robust optimal control enables CAJun to achieve more dynamic and adaptive jumping than prior model-based or end-to-end learned controllers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents CAJun, a hierarchical learning and control framework for enabling legged robots to jump continuously with adaptive jumping distances. The key components are:

- A high-level centroidal policy trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to specify the desired gait timing, base velocity, and swing foot position. 

- A low-level leg controller that converts the centroidal policy's commands into joint torque. It uses quadratic programming (QP) to optimize ground reaction forces for the stance legs and PD control for the swing legs. 

- An efficient formulation of the QP as an unconstrained least squares problem to significantly speed up policy training.

The framework combines the versatility of learning for high-level planning with the robustness of optimization for low-level control. Experiments on a quadruped robot show the framework can achieve continuous long jumps with adaptive distances after only 20 mins of training. It also enables gap crossing of up to 70cm, 40% wider than prior methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the challenge of enabling legged robots to traverse challenging terrains that require jumping abilities, such as gaps or stepping stones. In particular, it is aiming to achieve continuous and adaptive jumping over long distances on real quadrupedal robots. Some key problems and questions it is trying to tackle:

- How can we enable legged robots to perform continuous jumping behaviors (as opposed to just single jumps)? This requires stability over many repeated jump cycles.

- How can we enable jumping distances to be adaptive based on terrain requirements or user commands, rather than fixed? This requires generalization beyond pre-planned trajectories.

- How can jumping skills learned in simulation be directly transferred to real-world robots without much fine-tuning? This is challenging due to dynamics gaps between simulation and the real world. 

- How can we combine learning-based methods like reinforcement learning with robust control techniques to get the best of both worlds - versatility of learning and robustness of optimal control?

- How can we make the training of hierarchical controllers (with both a high-level policy and low-level controller) efficient and fast enough for real-world deployment? Training time is often a bottleneck.

Overall, this paper aims to push the capability and robustness of legged robot jumping using a novel hierarchical learning and control framework that integrates reinforcement learning with optimization-based control in an efficient way. The key goal is enabling continuous, long-distance jumping with adaptive distances directly on a real quadrupedal robot.
