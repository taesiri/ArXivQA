# [CAJun: Continuous Adaptive Jumping using a Learned Centroidal Controller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09557)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an efficient framework that enables legged robots to achieve continuous, long-distance jumping with adaptive jump distances?The key hypothesis appears to be: By combining model-based optimal control with reinforcement learning in a hierarchical framework, it should be possible to leverage the strengths of both approaches - the robustness and feedback control of optimal control with the versatility and adaptability of learning. This can potentially enable continuous jumping over long distances with minimal sim-to-real gap.Some key points:- The proposed framework CAJUN consists of a high-level learned centroidal policy that outputs desired gait timing, base velocity, and foot position. - The low-level leg controller converts these into motor commands, using separate swing and stance leg controllers.- The stance leg controller is based on a fast ground reaction force optimization that enables efficient training.- Policies are trained using PPO in a sim-to-real setup.- Experiments show CAJUN can achieve continuous jumping with distances up to 70cm, crossing wider gaps compared to prior work.- The hierarchical structure enables efficient training and sim-to-real transfer compared to end-to-end methods.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that combining model-based control and learning hierarchically can enable more efficient and capable jumping policies that successfully transfer to the real world. The results seem to validate this hypothesis.
