# [Measuring Social Norms of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02491)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called SocialAgent for evaluating whether large language models (LLMs) understand social norms. 

Problem:
There is a debate on whether LLMs are consistent with human and societal values and norms, which has implications for the adoption of these models. However, existing datasets for evaluating social science understanding have limitations, as they do not focus specifically on testing comprehension of fundamental social norms.

Dataset: 
To address this, the authors create a new benchmark called SocialAgent, which features 12,383 multiple choice questions covering 402 unique social norm skills. The skills span topics like rules in language, culture, economics, laws, etc. The dataset is designed based on the K-12 curriculum to enable comparison of LLMs to human students.

Experiments:
The paper benchmarks recent LLMs like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA on this dataset. While they substantially outperform prior models, there is still a gap compared to average human student performance. 

Proposed Solution:  
To improve LLM understanding of social norms, the authors propose SocialAgent, a multi-agent model involving three LLM agents for retrieval, programming, and reasoning. By combining contextual knowledge, symbolic knowledge, and model knowledge, this method leads to GPT-3.5 outperforming average students.

Main Contributions:
- New benchmark focusing specifically on understanding social norms, with comparison to human performance
- Multi-agent model that combines different knowledge types to improve LLM social norms understanding to human level
- Analysis showing recent LLM advances have significantly improved comprehension of social norms

The paper aims to foster research into enhancing alignment of foundation models like LLMs with human social norms.
