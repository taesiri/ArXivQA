# [Are Large Language Models Post Hoc Explainers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05797)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can large language models (LLMs) be effectively used to generate explanations for understanding the predictions of other machine learning models? 

Specifically, the authors propose and evaluate different strategies for using LLMs to generate post-hoc explanations for complex black-box models by leveraging LLMs' ability for in-context learning. The key hypothesis appears to be that by properly formulating the explanation task as a prompt with examples, LLMs can learn to mimic existing explanation methods and provide faithful explanations for model predictions. 

The authors test this central hypothesis through experiments on benchmark datasets and models, evaluating the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations against several state-of-the-art explanation methods using metrics like feature agreement and prediction gap. Their results suggest that with the right prompting strategies, LLMs can identify important features and generate explanations that are comparable in faithfulness to existing methods, supporting their hypothesis about the viability of using LLMs as explainers.

In summary, the central research question is about the potential for using LLMs as post-hoc explainers by leveraging in-context learning, and the key hypothesis is that LLMs can generate faithful explanations if prompted appropriately. The experiments aim to evaluate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Presenting the first framework to systematically study the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 in explaining other machine learning models. 

2. Proposing four distinct prompting strategies (Perturbation-based ICL, Prediction-based ICL, Instruction-based ICL, Explanation-based ICL) to generate post-hoc explanations from LLMs by varying the amount of information provided about the model, dataset, and task.

3. Demonstrating through extensive experiments on real-world datasets that LLM-generated explanations can perform on par with state-of-the-art post-hoc explanation methods like LIME and integrated gradients.

4. Showing that LLMs can accurately identify the most influential feature 72% of the time, and that GPT-4 generates more faithful explanations compared to GPT-3, highlighting the potential of LLMs as next-generation explainers.

5. Providing an open-source framework with implementations of the proposed prompting strategies, metrics to evaluate explanation faithfulness, and utilities to support using new LLMs as explainers.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting the first comprehensive framework and systematic analysis focused on harnessing the knowledge and in-context learning abilities of large language models to generate post-hoc explanations for complex black-box machine learning models. The proposed methods and empirical results demonstrate the promise of using LLMs as explainers.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework with multiple prompting strategies for using large language models to generate explanations for predictions from other machine learning models, and shows through experiments on benchmark datasets that the LLM-generated explanations can perform on par with existing state-of-the-art methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I see it comparing to other research in the field of explainable AI/machine learning:

- The key focus of this work is using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 to generate post-hoc explanations for machine learning model predictions. This is a relatively new and underexplored area compared to most work in explainable AI, which focuses on developing specialized explanation methods and techniques.

- Most prior work on evaluating/enhancing LLMs has focused on their capabilities for language tasks like translation, question answering, etc. This paper explores the novel direction of using LLMs for a structured task - generating explanations.

- Many existing explanation methods rely on access to model internals like gradients. A strength of the proposed approach is generating explanations in a model-agnostic way purely based on the inputs and outputs.

- The techniques for prompting the LLMs to generate explanations are innovative, providing different levels of guidance from just input-output pairs to full instructions. This is different from how LLMs are typically applied today.

- The variety of evaluation metrics and datasets used to assess the LLM-generated explanations is quite extensive compared to typical work that focuses on 1 or 2 datasets. This provides a robust analysis.

- Overall, while explainable AI is a popular research area, using LLMs specifically for this task is unique and underexplored currently. The comprehensive set of experiments and different prompting strategies make a promising case for the capabilities of LLMs as explainers. If this direction is pursued further, it could open up new possibilities for model explanation and interpretation.

In summary, I see this work as pioneering a new sub-area in the XAI field by adapting LLMs for explanation generation using novel prompting strategies and providing an extensive empirical analysis. The results demonstrate the promise of this approach compared to existing specialized explanation methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Exploring different prompting strategies and design choices for using LLMs to generate explanations. The authors propose four prompting strategies in their framework but suggest there may be other effective ways to prompt LLMs to generate explanations. They also suggest exploring how factors like the number of in-context examples impact the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations.

2. Applying the framework to additional models and datasets. The authors demonstrate their approach on four benchmark datasets and two ML models. They suggest expanding the evaluation to more complex models like deep neural networks and a wider range of datasets.

3. Comparing different LLMs as explainers. The authors show GPT-3 vs GPT-4 but suggest examining how other state-of-the-art LLMs perform at generating faithful explanations.

4. Developing better ways to quantitatively evaluate explanation faithfulness. The authors use several existing metrics but suggest exploring new metrics tailored to evaluating LLM-generated explanations.

5. Exploring how best to integrate LLM explanations into real-world XAI systems and workflows. The authors present an initial framework but suggest more work needs to be done on effectively using LLMs as part of the model development and deployment process.

In summary, the main directions are: exploring new prompting strategies, applying the approach to more models/datasets, comparing LLMs, developing better evaluation metrics, and integrating LLM explanations into real-world systems. The authors propose an initial framework for using LLMs as explainers but highlight many open questions and opportunities for future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework to study the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in explaining the predictions of other machine learning models. The authors propose four prompting strategies to generate explanations using LLMs: perturbation-based, prediction-based, instruction-based, and explanation-based in-context learning. In the first three strategies, the LLM is provided with local neighborhood samples and labels of an instance to identify key predictive features. The fourth strategy leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs by providing input-output-explanation examples generated by existing explainers, and asking the LLM to generate explanations for new samples. 

The authors conduct extensive experiments with real-world datasets and models to evaluate LLM-generated explanations. The results demonstrate LLMs can identify the most important feature with 72% accuracy and mimic existing explainers when provided with just 4 explanation examples. Overall, the proposed framework and prompting strategies enable LLMs to generate explanations on par with state-of-the-art methods. The work opens new possibilities for using LLMs as post hoc explainers to understand black-box model predictions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose several different prompting strategies for using LLMs to generate explanations - \vanillaExp, \classicICL, \instructionICL, and \iclExp. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these strategies and how they provide different levels of information to the LLM? What are the relative pros and cons of each?

2. When using the \vanillaExp strategy, the authors sample input-output pairs from the local neighborhood of the instance to be explained. How does the sampling strategy (e.g. random vs highest confidence) impact the quality of the explanations generated? Are there other sampling techniques that could further improve performance?

3. The \classicICL strategy has the LLM first make predictions on the ICL samples before generating explanations. How does this differ from the other strategies and does having the LLM emulate the model provide any benefits? Could there be cases where this hurts explanation faithfulness? 

4. The \instructionICL strategy provides detailed step-by-step instructions to the LLM on how to analyze feature importance. Why is this more structured approach beneficial compared to just asking the LLM for explanations? Are there any downsides to being overly prescriptive?

5. For the \iclExp strategy, the authors use ICL examples from existing explanation methods. How does the choice of explanation method impact the LLM's explanations? Could combining examples from multiple methods lead to better performance?

6. The authors evaluate the LLM explanations using both simulated and real datasets. Are there any differences in how well the strategies work between simulated and real data? Are additional prompting adjustments needed for real-world applications?

7. The results show LLMs accurately identify the most important feature but struggle with top-k for k>1. Why does performance degrade for explaining multiple features and how could the prompting be improved to address this?

8. How does the choice of LLM model (\gptthree vs \gptfour) impact the quality of explanations? Would even larger or more advanced LLMs lead to further improvements? What model limitations need to be overcome?

9. The authors provide a software framework for generating LLM explanations. What are the key technical components needed to deploy this in a real-world setting? What software engineering challenges need to be addressed?

10. The paper focuses on tabular data, but how could these prompting strategies be adapted to generate explanations for other data types like text, image, or time series data? Would fundamentally different approaches be needed?
