# [Evaluating Cognitive Maps and Planning in Large Language Models with   CogEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15129)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not seem to be presenting original research. Rather, it appears to be introducing a protocol called "CogEval" for evaluating the cognitive and planning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key contributions seem to be:

1) Proposing the CogEval protocol for systematically evaluating LLMs' functional cognitive capacities like planning, theory of mind, etc. 

2) Applying this protocol to evaluate the cognitive map and planning abilities of various LLMs including GPT-3, GPT-4, Anthropic, Google, etc.

The central hypothesis seems to be that LLMs may lack true understanding of the latent relational structures underlying planning tasks, referred to as "cognitive maps." To test this, they designed prompts based on human experiments that require extracting and using a cognitive map. They hypothesized LLMs would struggle on tasks requiring cognitive maps, especially on complex graph structures.

Their key findings were:

- LLMs showed apparent competence on simple planning tasks, but struggled on more complex community graph structures.

- Systematic evaluation revealed striking failure modes like edge hallucination, suboptimal trajectories, and getting trapped in loops.

- The results suggest current LLMs lack out-of-the-box planning abilities, likely because they fail to comprehend cognitive maps.

So in summary, this paper introduced a protocol for evaluating LLMs' cognitive abilities, and applied it to assess their planning capacities, revealing deficiencies hypothesized to arise from lack of cognitive map understanding. The overall goal was to systematically probe for emergent cognitive abilities in LLMs using insights from cognitive science.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is how it compares and contributes to other research in its field:

The main contribution of this paper is introducing a systematic protocol called CogEval for evaluating cognitive abilities like planning in large language models (LLMs). The authors argue that most prior claims of emergent cognitive skills in LLMs are based on anecdotes or individual examples rather than rigorous, controlled experiments across variations in tasks and conditions. 

To address this, CogEval involves:

- Operationalizing a cognitive ability like planning into multiple experimentally-validated tasks that measure the construct in different ways.

- Generating many task variations that control for factors like graph structure, domain, and condition. 

- Repeated measurements and statistical analysis to evaluate model performance robustness.

- Analysis of different failure modes.

The authors then demonstrate CogEval by evaluating planning and cognitive map abilities in 8 major LLMs. Their key finding is that while LLMs show competence on simple planning tasks, they struggle with more complex tasks requiring representing latent graph structures.

This contrasts with prior work that evaluated planning abilities in LLMs less systematically, like BIG-Bench or some GPT-3 planning benchmarks. The authors argue those benchmarks had limitations like potential training data contamination. 

Overall, this paper makes both a methodological contribution in CogEval, and an empirical contribution in rigorously evaluating LLMs for planning using cognitive science paradigms. The findings temper claims of emergent planning abilities in LLMs and highlight the need for careful, controlled evaluation.

Compared to cognitive science evaluations of human planning, this work translates those experimental paradigms to test LLMs. It represents a more cognitively-grounded approach than some past AI benchmarking. The systematic variation in tasks and analysis of failure modes also goes beyond what is typical in NLP leaderboard evaluations.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions both in its proposed CogEval methodology and in its careful, controlled evaluation of planning in major LLMs using that methodology. It raises the standards for rigorously assessing cognitive abilities in LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigating representational similarities in the embeddings to test hypotheses about the representations underlying success and failure modes in LLMs. This is similar to how neuroscience analyzes neural data to understand the representations involved in planning and decision-making.

- Studying the limits of LLMs' transitive inference ability using pairwise associations, building on the observation that while LLMs struggled with planning, some could identify item associations.

- Exploring whether the use of schemas (overused, generalized cognitive maps like "airport") could improve performance on real-world scenarios, given LLMs can apply analogical reasoning.

- Developing more hypothesis-driven and brain-inspired architectures that incorporate mechanisms for executive control and planning, which could lead to more efficient AI compared to simply scaling up parameters and data.

- Adding specialized memory and planning modules to LLMs that mimic the function of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in extracting relational structure and flexibly planning at multiple scales.

- Further analysis of the failure modes through inspection of the internal representations of the LLM, to better understand the causes of behaviors like edge hallucination and getting trapped in loops during planning.

In summary, the authors highlight directions like developing more structured architectures, adding planning modules, studying the limitations of relational reasoning, and deeper analysis of failure modes to better understand and improve LLMs' cognitive abilities related to planning and cognitive maps. The overarching theme is moving beyond pure scaling to more structured and targeted improvement of capacities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a cognitive science-inspired protocol called CogEval for systematically evaluating cognitive abilities like planning in large language models (LLMs). The CogEval protocol involves operationalizing the cognitive ability through multiple tasks with variations in factors like underlying structure, domain, and conditions. It also involves generating multiple responses per task and comparing results statistically across models and parameters. The paper applies CogEval to evaluate cognitive maps and planning abilities in 8 LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Anthropic Claude, and Google's Bard. The tasks are based on human experiments on cognitive maps, avoiding potential training set contamination. The results show LLMs can solve simple planning tasks relying on route memory, but fail on more complex tasks requiring understanding relational structure. Systematic evaluation reveals striking failure modes like invalid trajectories and getting trapped in loops. The findings suggest current LLMs lack emergent planning abilities, possibly due to lack of cognitive map comprehension. This challenges claims of human-like cognition in LLMs, and cautions their use in planning applications.

In summary, this paper introduces a rigorous cognitive science protocol for evaluating abilities like planning in LLMs. By applying this protocol, the paper provides evidence against emergent planning abilities in current LLMs including GPT-4. The results highlight the need for careful and systematic evaluation of claimed cognitive abilities in LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces CogEval, a cognitive science-inspired protocol for the systematic evaluation of cognitive capacities in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors follow this protocol to evaluate cognitive maps and planning ability in eight LLMs, including OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Davinci, Google Bard, Cohere, Anthropic Claude, LLaMA, and Alpaca. They design multiple planning task prompts based on non-linguistic human experiments that vary in their underlying graph structure, domain (spatial, social, objects), and conditions (value-based, revaluation, shortcut, detour). The model responses are generated 30 times per condition for OpenAI models and once for others to allow for statistical comparison. The results are analyzed using logistic regression to assess the effect of varying factors like graph, domain, and condition on performance. This allows the authors to systematically evaluate the reliability and robustness of cognitive map understanding and planning abilities across models. The failure modes are also analyzed. Overall, the cognitive science-inspired protocol with multiple controlled factors enables rigorous evaluation of the functional planning capacities of LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the question of evaluating cognitive maps and planning abilities in large language models. Specifically, it seems the paper is proposing a new method (CogEval) for systematically evaluating these cognitive capacities in large language models, and is applying this method to test whether large language models actually exhibit out-of-the-box competence at cognitive map understanding and planning. 

The key goals and contributions of the paper appear to be:

1) Proposing CogEval, a protocol for robustly evaluating cognitive abilities like planning in large language models, using principles from cognitive science. 

2) Using CogEval to evaluate cognitive maps and planning in 8 different large language models, including GPT-4.

3) Finding that while LLMs can show some apparent competence on simpler planning tasks, they fail on more complex tasks involving dense graphs and community structures. This suggests LLMs lack a real understanding of cognitive maps needed for planning.

4) Analyzing different failure modes seen when LLMs attempt planning tasks, like generating invalid trajectories or getting trapped in loops.

5) Arguing the results show LLMs do not have emergent cognitive map or planning abilities, and discussing implications for how LLMs should be applied and augmented in future work.

In summary, the key goals are to propose a new evaluation protocol for LLMs, apply it to an important cognitive domain of planning, and analyze the extent to which current LLMs possess these cognitive abilities. The results suggest current LLMs are limited in planning due to lack of cognitive map understanding.
