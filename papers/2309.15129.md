# [Evaluating Cognitive Maps and Planning in Large Language Models with   CogEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15129)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the information provided, it appears that the central research question this paper addresses is:

Do large language models (LLMs) show emergent cognitive abilities like cognitive map comprehension and planning, or are these capacities still lacking in current LLM systems?

The abstract indicates that the authors systematically evaluated the abilities of various LLMs (including GPT-4) in understanding and using cognitive maps for planning and navigation tasks. 

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) LLMs may lack the ability to understand the latent relational structure (cognitive maps) that underlies planning problems. This could lead to failures in goal-directed reasoning and trajectory planning.

2) LLMs do not have robust out-of-the-box planning abilities. While they may show apparent competence on some simple planning tasks, closer evaluation reveals limitations and failure modes.

The authors designed prompts based on human experiments in cognitive science to evaluate if LLMs can extract cognitive maps from text input and use them for flexible planning. They tested the LLMs on planning tasks with different underlying graph structures and domains. 

The main research contribution appears to be the proposal of a systematic protocol (CogEval) for evaluating planning and other cognitive abilities in LLMs, and the application of this protocol to provide evidence that current LLMs lack robust cognitive mapping and planning capacities.

In summary, the key question addressed is whether LLMs like GPT-4 display emergent cognitive abilities like using cognitive maps for planning, or if they still fail at these skills when evaluated more systematically. The CogEval protocol and experiments provide evidence for the latter.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. The proposal of CogEval, a protocol for systematically evaluating cognitive capabilities like planning, theory of mind, causal reasoning, etc in large language models (LLMs). The key aspects of CogEval are:

- Operationalizing the cognitive ability of interest (e.g. planning) into multiple tasks with variations in structure, domain, and conditions. This allows probing the ability from different angles.

- Generating repeated measurements across models and parameters like temperature to evaluate statistical robustness. 

- Using controls and chain of thought (CoT) prompts to understand limits of the cognitive abilities.

- Analyzing different failure modes.

2. Applying CogEval to systematically evaluate cognitive maps and planning abilities in 8 LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-3, Google Bard, Anthropic, etc. 

The key findings from the evaluation are:

- LLMs only show apparent competence on simpler planning tasks where route memorization suffices. 

- They display failures like hallucinating invalid trajectories, getting trapped in loops etc on tasks requiring latent relational reasoning.

- There is no evidence for out-of-the-box planning abilities in LLMs. The results suggest LLMs may lack understanding of cognitive maps or relational structures underlying planning problems.

So in summary, the main contributions are (i) proposing a principled protocol for evaluating cognitive abilities in LLMs, and (ii) findings from a systematic evaluation of planning and cognitive maps in major LLMs using this protocol. The results point out some limitations in LLMs' reasoning abilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract provided, this paper makes two main contributions to the study of cognitive abilities in large language models (LLMs):

1. It proposes a new evaluation protocol called CogEval, which draws inspiration from cognitive science methods to systematically assess different cognitive capabilities in LLMs. The key aspects of CogEval are:

- Operationalizing the ability of interest (e.g. planning, theory of mind) into measurable tasks. 

- Using multiple variations of tasks, controls, and repeated measurements for robustness.

- Applying statistical analysis to compare performance across models and parameters.

This protocol seems more rigorous than typical LLM evaluations that rely on anecdotes or individual task performance. It emphasizes properly defining constructs, controlling factors, and statistical testing.

2. The paper applies CogEval to evaluate "cognitive maps" and planning abilities in multiple LLMs. It tests their ability to understand and use latent relational structures (graphs) to plan sequences of actions. 

- The prompts are novel and based on human cognitive science experiments, avoiding training set contamination.

- The tasks systematically vary the graph structure, domain, and planning conditions. 

- The results find limited planning ability, with failure modes like hallucinating invalid trajectories.

This contribution provides much-needed systematic evidence on the planning limitations of LLMs. Prior work either lacked rigorous testing or focused on a single model.

Overall, the CogEval protocol and its application here seem to advance the methodology of LLM evaluation compared to prior work. The cognitive science-inspired, controlled, and statistically-driven approach could serve as a model for rigorously testing other cognitive claims about LLMs in the future. The planning evaluation also provides an important benchmark and cautionary findings for AI safety and alignment researchers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more brain-inspired and hypothesis-driven architectures for language models, rather than relying solely on scale. The authors argue that smaller, more specialized models with well-designed architectures could potentially achieve similar capabilities as large models, but in a more efficient and interpretable way.

- Adding "memory and planning" augmentations to language models to mitigate observed failures in tasks requiring cognitive maps and planning. The authors suggest memory and planning modules akin to the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex could help extract relational structure and enable flexible planning.

- Analyzing the internal representations and embeddings of language models to better understand the mechanisms underlying their successes and failures at cognitive tasks. This is analogous to how neuroscientists analyze neural data.

- Further exploring the limits of language models' "transitive inference" abilities using pairwise associations between items/states. The authors found some language models could express pairwise relationships but failed at cognitive tasks requiring an integrated understanding.

- Investigating whether providing language models with abstract schemas could improve performance on real-world planning and reasoning tasks. Schemas encapsulate common structures like "restaurant" or "airport" that could aid analogy and transfer.

- Developing more intensive tests of language models' systematic generalization abilities using variations in community graph structures and planning tasks. The current experiments reveal brittle performance.

- Exploring whether and how different prompting strategies like providing examples and explanations impact language models' cognitive task performance. The effects were inconsistent in the current study.

In summary, the authors call for more rigorous, cognitively-inspired evaluation of language models to precisely characterize abilities, developing more structured and neurally-inspired architectures, and exploring methods to improve systematic generalization, planning, and reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on the provided text, here is a one paragraph summary:

This paper proposes and demonstrates CogEval, a protocol for systematically evaluating cognitive abilities like planning in large language models (LLMs). The authors follow CogEval to assess the cognitive map and planning capacities of several LLMs. They design novel prompts adapted from human cognitive science experiments on graphs and planning tasks. These prompts avoid any training set contamination risks. The prompts vary underlying graph structures, domains like spatial or social, and task conditions like shortcuts. The authors generate repeated measurements across LLMs and temperatures and statistically analyze results. They find LLMs only succeed on simple route tasks, but display failure modes on complex graphs, like hallucinating invalid paths or getting trapped in loops. Overall, the results indicate limitations in emergent cognitive mapping and planning in current LLMs, suggesting they cannot effectively utilize relational structures for flexible planning without further improvements. The paper introduces a rigorous methodology and provides initial evidence against claims of human-like planning emerging in large models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper seems to be addressing two main issues:

1. The lack of rigorous, systematic evaluation protocols to assess emergent cognitive abilities in large language models (LLMs). 

2. The specific question of whether LLMs possess cognitive map and planning abilities akin to humans and animals, and if not, why they fail at these tasks.

To address these issues, the paper makes two key contributions:

1. It proposes a protocol called CogEval for systematically evaluating cognitive abilities in LLMs, inspired by methods from cognitive science. 

2. It applies CogEval to assess cognitive maps and planning in multiple LLMs including GPT-4. The tasks are adapted from human experiments on cognitive maps and planning.

The authors find that while LLMs can solve some simple planning tasks, they struggle with more complex ones involving latent relational structures. Their failures suggest LLMs lack a true understanding of the cognitive maps underlying planning problems.

In summary, the paper introduces a rigorous methodology for testing cognitive skills in LLMs, and provides evidence that LLMs currently lack robust cognitive mapping and planning abilities despite progress in other areas. The results highlight the need for further research into architectures and training methods that can produce stronger general reasoning in LLMs.
