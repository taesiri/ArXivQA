# [Markov Persuasion Processes: Learning to Persuade from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies "Markov persuasion processes" (MPPs) which model sequential interactions between a sender and a stream of myopic receivers in a Markovian environment. 
- Existing works on MPPs make unrealistic assumptions like the sender having full knowledge of receivers' rewards. This prevents operationalization in real applications.
- The paper considers a more realistic setting where the sender starts with no knowledge about the environment - transitions, priors, sender/receiver rewards. The goal is to design learning algorithms for the sender that attain sublinear regret and persuasiveness violation over episodes.

Proposed Solution:
- A warm-up "Optimistic Persuasive Policy Search" (OPPS) algorithm is provided for the full feedback setting. It solves an optimistic LP to compute signaling policies, attaining Õ(√T) regret and violation.
- For the more challenging partial feedback case, OPPS has an exploration phase to gather feedback on persuasiveness followed by optimistic policy search. It achieves a tunable Õ(T^α) regret and Õ(T^(1-α/2)) violation.
- Lower bounds are provided showing the regret/violation tradeoff achieved by OPPS is optimal.

Main Contributions:
- First to address MPPs where sender starts off with no environment knowledge, a highly realistic setting
- Warm-up OPPS algorithm for full feedback case achieving Õ(√T) regret and violation 
- Partial feedback OPPS algorithm with exploration-exploitation structure achieving optimally tunable regret/violation tradeoff
- Lower bound proving optimality of tradeoff achieved by partial feedback OPPS
- Significantly relaxes assumptions in prior works to enable operationalization in real applications


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the problem of a sender sequentially persuading a stream of myopic receivers in a Markovian environment, where the sender has no prior knowledge and learns an information disclosure policy over time to maximize long-term rewards while keeping persuasiveness violation sublinear.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a learning algorithm called Optimistic Persuasive Policy Search (OPPS) for the sender in Markov persuasion processes (MPPs) where the sender has no prior knowledge about the environment, including receivers' rewards. The key aspects of the contribution are:

1) Addressing a more realistic and challenging setting of MPPs where the sender does not know receivers' rewards, unlike previous work that assumes this knowledge. 

2) Designing an OPPS algorithm that attains sublinear regret and persuasiveness violation bounds as the number of episodes grows. Specifically, with full feedback the bounds are Õ(√T) and with partial feedback the bounds exhibit an optimal tradeoff controlled by a tunable parameter α.

3) Providing theoretical analysis to prove the sublinear regret and violation guarantees of OPPS. This includes a key lemma showing OPPS admits a feasible solution in each episode.  

4) Establishing a lower bound matching the tradeoff attained by OPPS under partial feedback, proving the algorithm is optimally balancing regret and violation.

5) Significantly relaxing assumptions compared to prior work on MPPs to enable applicability in real-world sequential persuasion problems where sender lacks environment knowledge.

In summary, the paper makes a theoretical and practical contribution by proposing and analyzing an optimistically persuasive learning algorithm for sequential persuasion that does not presume knowledge of receivers' rewards.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Markov persuasion processes (MPPs): Sequential Bayesian persuasion settings where a sender faces a stream of myopic receivers in a Markovian environment.

- Regret: The difference between the cumulative sender's expected reward obtained by always using an optimal information-disclosure policy and that achieved by the learning algorithm. 

- Violation: The overall expected loss in persuasiveness incurred by the learning algorithm over the episodes.

- Optimistic Persuasive Policy Search (OPPS): The learning algorithm proposed that solves an optimistic version of the offline optimization problem to compute signaling policies. 

- Full feedback: A setting where the sender observes rewards for all state-action pairs at the end of each episode.

- Partial feedback: A setting where the sender only observes rewards for the state-action pairs that were visited in the episode.

- Exploration vs exploitation trade-off: In partial feedback settings, some episodes must be devoted to exploration to learn how to satisfy persuasiveness constraints, while other episodes exploit current knowledge to maximize rewards.

So in summary, the key things this paper addresses are sequential Bayesian persuasion (MPP), learning signaling policies, balancing regret and violation, and managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. The OPPS algorithm is proposed to tackle these challenges.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper assumes the sender has no prior knowledge about the environment, including transition probabilities, prior distributions, and agent rewards. How might the proposed algorithm change if the sender had some partial knowledge about certain components of the environment? 

2. The Optimistic Persuasive Policy Search (OPPS) algorithm employs an exploration phase to gather feedback on the persuasiveness constraints before switching to an exploitation approach. What are some alternative ways the exploration vs exploitation tradeoff could be handled?

3. How does the dependence on key parameters like the number of states, actions, and outcomes in the regret and violation bounds compare to other relevant algorithms in the literature? Are there assumptions that could be relaxed to improve the bounds?  

4. The paper analyzes both a full feedback setting and a partial feedback setting. What are the key challenges and differences in the analysis between these two settings? How do the differences manifest in the regret and violation guarantees?

5. Could kernel-based methods or representation learning be integrated into OPPS to improve generalization across states and actions? What challenges might arise?

6. The lower bound result shows the difficulty of being persuasive in every round with high probability when the sender has no knowledge of receiver rewards. Are there alternative metrics or assumptions that could allow for persuasive policies at every time step?

7. How does the structure and analysis of OPPS compare to optimism-based algorithms for exploration in reinforcement learning and bandits? Could ideas from that literature be used to improve OPPS?

8. Could OPPS be extended to a setting with multiple senders and receivers? What new challenges arise in analyzing multi-agent persuasion processes?

9. The paper assumes the receivers act myopically at each time step based on the sender's recommendations. How might the algorithm and analysis change with non-myopic, forward-thinking receivers? 

10. The MPP model includes stochastic transitions and rewards. What new issues arise compared to a deterministic MPP setting, and how do the results change? Could OPPS leverage model structure for faster learning?
