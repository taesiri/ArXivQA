# [Markov Persuasion Processes: Learning to Persuade from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies "Markov persuasion processes" (MPPs) which model sequential interactions between a sender and a stream of myopic receivers in a Markovian environment. 
- Existing works on MPPs make unrealistic assumptions like the sender having full knowledge of receivers' rewards. This prevents operationalization in real applications.
- The paper considers a more realistic setting where the sender starts with no knowledge about the environment - transitions, priors, sender/receiver rewards. The goal is to design learning algorithms for the sender that attain sublinear regret and persuasiveness violation over episodes.

Proposed Solution:
- A warm-up "Optimistic Persuasive Policy Search" (OPPS) algorithm is provided for the full feedback setting. It solves an optimistic LP to compute signaling policies, attaining Õ(√T) regret and violation.
- For the more challenging partial feedback case, OPPS has an exploration phase to gather feedback on persuasiveness followed by optimistic policy search. It achieves a tunable Õ(T^α) regret and Õ(T^(1-α/2)) violation.
- Lower bounds are provided showing the regret/violation tradeoff achieved by OPPS is optimal.

Main Contributions:
- First to address MPPs where sender starts off with no environment knowledge, a highly realistic setting
- Warm-up OPPS algorithm for full feedback case achieving Õ(√T) regret and violation 
- Partial feedback OPPS algorithm with exploration-exploitation structure achieving optimally tunable regret/violation tradeoff
- Lower bound proving optimality of tradeoff achieved by partial feedback OPPS
- Significantly relaxes assumptions in prior works to enable operationalization in real applications
