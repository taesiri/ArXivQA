Problem:
Charts are pivotal for communicating insights from complex data, but automatic understanding of charts by machines remains challenging. While traditional chart understanding methods have limitations in domain portability and reasoning robustness, recent advancements with large foundation models provide new opportunities. However, charts have unique obstacles due to their multifaceted visual representations and nuanced semantics. This paper surveys the landscape of automatic chart understanding research amidst the rise of large foundation models.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments, tasks, datasets, modeling strategies, state-of-the-art performance, challenges and future directions in automatic chart understanding. It begins by defining chart understanding and outlining key components like vision encoders, OCR, text encoders/decoders. Next, it explores tasks (e.g. chart QA, captioning), datasets, sources, diversity, limitations, and evaluation metrics. Then, it examines modeling strategies including classification and generation methods, pre-training techniques, and large vision-language models. Tool augmentation is also discussed as a way to enhance chart understanding. State-of-the-art performance across different tasks is showcased.  

Main Contributions:
- Thorough analysis of chart understanding tasks, datasets, evaluation metrics
