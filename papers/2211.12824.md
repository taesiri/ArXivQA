# [Tell Me What Happened: Unifying Text-guided Video Completion via   Multimodal Masked Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12824)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to perform controllable video completion from partial frames guided by natural language instructions. 

Specifically, the paper introduces a new task called text-guided video completion (TVC) where the goal is to generate a complete video from just the first frame (prediction), last frame (rewind), or first and last frames (infilling), guided by a textual description. 

The key hypothesis is that using language instructions along with limited visual frames can make video completion more controllable and better meet human expectations compared to just using the visual frames alone.

To address this, the paper proposes a novel model called Multimodal Masked Video Generation (MMVG) which can perform all cases of TVC in a unified framework with a single training. The core ideas are:

- Representing video frames as discrete visual tokens using a temporal-aware VQGAN.

- Applying masking to input partial frames from diverse timepoints and learning to recover the full video. 

- Fusing text and masked visual frames via a multimodal encoder-decoder architecture.

- Varying the masking conditions during training to unify prediction, rewind, and infilling tasks.

The main hypothesis is that the proposed MMVG with language guidance and masking strategy can effectively address the TVC problem and generate high-quality and controllable video completion results. Experiments on diverse video datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new task called text-guided video completion (TVC), where the goal is to generate a complete video from partial frames guided by a textual description. The task has three variants: prediction from first frame, rewind from last frame, and infilling between first and last frames.

2. It proposes a novel model called Multimodal Masked Video Generation (MMVG) to address the TVC task. MMVG represents video frames as discrete visual tokens using a temporal-aware VQGAN. It uses a masking strategy during training to learn to complete videos from partial frame sequences. The same trained model can perform all three TVC tasks at inference time by varying the masking. 

3. It evaluates MMVG on three datasets - Kitchen, Flintstones, and MUGEN - corresponding to egocentric, animation, and gaming video scenes. Results show MMVG is effective at generating high quality and controllable videos for the TVC task. It also shows improved performance on standard video generation/prediction tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of the TVC task and a novel MMVG model that can perform video completion from partial frames in a controllable way via natural language guidance. The paper demonstrates promising results on this new task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper: 

The paper introduces a new task called text-guided video completion, where a model generates missing frames in a video using first, last, or both frames as context, guided by a natural language instruction, and proposes a method called Multimodal Masked Video Generation that can perform this task in a unified way through an effective masking strategy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of video completion and generation:

- This paper introduces a new task called text-guided video completion (TVC) which involves generating complete videos from partial input frames and guiding text. This is a novel task formulation not explored in prior work. 

- Most prior work has focused just on unconditional video generation or future video prediction from initial frames. This paper proposes a more general video completion task with three cases - prediction, rewind, and infilling.

- For prediction, this paper compares to autoregressive transformer models like VideoGPT and TATS. The key difference is the proposed masking strategy during training that helps learn better temporal coherence.

- For rewind and infilling, there is limited prior work. This paper compares to FILM for infilling and shows substantial gains. Rewind is a particularly new task contribution.

- The proposed MMVG model with discrete visual tokens is most similar to prior VQ-VAE based approaches like TATS. The main novelty is the masking strategy and leveraging spans during training to enable video completion from any frames.

- For text conditioning, this paper builds on prior text-to-video generation work. The comparisons on MSRVTT dataset show MMVG outperforming CoGVideo and TATS.

- The experiments comprehensively evaluate video generation/prediction as well as the three TVC tasks on diverse datasets. Both automatic and human evaluations are provided to benchmark performance.

In summary, this paper makes several novel contributions - formulating the TVC task, proposing an effective MMVG model tailored for it, and providing extensive experiments on a diverse set of video completion capabilities. The comparisons show the benefits of the proposed approach over relevant prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other potential applications of the text-guided video completion (TVC) task, beyond just the prediction, rewind, and infilling cases studied in this paper. The authors suggest TVC could enable new creative applications and be a fruitful area for further vision-and-language research.

- Improving the controllability and fidelity of the generated videos, so the model better follows the precise instructions and produces higher-quality and more realistic results. This could involve incorporating more common sense knowledge.

- Scaling up the model and training to handle longer, higher-resolution videos. The current model works on relatively short, low-resolution video clips.

- Studying how to better enforce temporal coherence and smoothness in the generated videos, perhaps through new losses or training techniques. Smoother interpolated motions and transitions remain a challenge.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of video datasets depicting different types of events, scenes, and actions. More generalization testing is needed.

- Combining the text conditioning approach with other advances in unconditional video generation models, such as diffusion models. Integrating text control into other modeling frameworks could be beneficial.

- Developing more advanced video discriminators and metrics to better evaluate the quality of text-guided video generation. Improved evaluation protocols are important for progress.

In summary, the main future directions relate to extending the TVC framework to new applications, improving the fidelity and coherence of the generated videos, scaling and generalizing the approach, and developing better evaluation methods. Advancing the state-of-the-art in controllable video generation through TVC seems to be the central focus.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new task called text-guided video completion (TVC) which involves generating a complete video given partial frames from the start, end, or both, guided by a textual description. The authors propose a model called Multimodal Masked Video Generation (MMVG) to address this task. MMVG represents video frames as discrete visual tokens using a temporal-aware VQGAN, masks parts of the input video, and feeds the masked video and text to a multimodal encoder. The decoder then learns to generate the complete video frames. By varying the masking conditions during training, a single MMVG model can perform video prediction, rewind, and infilling at inference time. Experiments on egocentric, animation, and gaming datasets show MMVG generates high-quality and controllable videos for TVC. The authors also demonstrate MMVG's effectiveness on video generation, prediction, and text-to-video tasks.
