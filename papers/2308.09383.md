# [Label-Free Event-based Object Recognition via Joint Learning with Image   Reconstruction from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09383)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we perform label-free event-based object recognition and image reconstruction from events, without needing category labels or paired images during training?The key points are:- The paper proposes a joint learning framework to simultaneously do event-based object recognition and image reconstruction from events. - This is done in a label-free manner, without needing category labels or paired intensity images for the events during training.- The core idea is to use the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model to provide semantic guidance for learning, by aligning reconstructed image features with textual features of category prompts.- Several losses and training strategies are introduced to enable stable joint training using predicted pseudo-labels, instead of true labels.- Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing unsupervised and image reconstruction-based methods on event recognition datasets, highlighting the capability for label-free learning.In summary, the main research question is how to do label-free event recognition and image reconstruction together, which is addressed through a joint learning framework using CLIP for semantic guidance without true labels. The key novelty is performing these tasks without paired data supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel joint learning framework for event-based object recognition and image reconstruction from events, without requiring paired images and labels. 2. It introduces a reliable data sampling (RDS) strategy and local-global reconstruction consistency to enhance the joint training without labels and paired images.3. It shows how unpaired images can be incorporated in the framework to further improve object recognition and reconstruction performance. 4. Through extensive experiments, it demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method on event-based object recognition and reconstruction over existing supervised, unsupervised, and image reconstruction-based methods. The framework is also shown to be effective for zero-shot object recognition.In summary, the key contribution is the proposed joint learning framework that enables simultaneous learning of event-based object recognition and image reconstruction in a label-free manner. The introduction of reliable data sampling and employing unpaired images are also important contributions to boost the joint learning process and performance without labels and paired images. The paper shows state-of-the-art results on event-based datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method.
