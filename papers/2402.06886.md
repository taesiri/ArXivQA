# [Principled Penalty-based Methods for Bilevel Reinforcement Learning and   RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06886)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies bilevel reinforcement learning (RL) problems where the lower-level problem is a RL problem and the upper-level problem can be either a smooth optimization problem or another RL problem. Bilevel RL covers diverse applications like Stackelberg Markov games, reward learning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Existing bilevel optimization methods cannot be directly applied to the bilevel RL setting due to the lack of strong convexity and uniform error bounds in the lower-level RL objective function. Thus new theories and algorithms tailored to bilevel RL problems are needed.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel penalty-based algorithmic framework for solving bilevel RL problems. Specifically, two tailored penalty functions are designed: value penalty and Bellman penalty. These penalties measure the optimality violation in the lower-level RL problem. It is proved that approximately solving the reformulated penalized single-level problem with either penalty recovers an approximate solution to the original bilevel problem. Leveraging the geometric property in policy optimization, explicit formulas of gradients are derived and a convergent policy gradient algorithm, named PBRL, is proposed.

Furthermore, the approach is extended to handle the lower-level two-player zero-sum game setting using the Nikaidoâ€“Isoda function as the penalty. Explicit gradient formula and the algorithm convergence are also established in this case.

Main Contributions:
- First penalty reformulation with convergence guarantees for bilevel RL problems. Two principled penalty functions are designed based on optimality conditions in RL.
- Established landscape analysis relating the reformulated problem's solutions to the original problem's, supporting the penalty approach.  
- Derived closed-form policy gradients for the reformulated problems.
- Proposed the first provably convergent policy gradient algorithm PBRL for bilevel RL and its two-player game extension.
- Demonstrated empirical performance on applications including Stackelberg games, RLHF and incentive design.
