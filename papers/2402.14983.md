# [Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated   Learning -- A Case of the Insurance Industry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14983)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The insurance industry suffers from a shortage of data volume and variety due to privacy concerns around sharing raw data. This limits the ability to develop accurate claim loss forecasting models.
- More data volume (more observations) and more data variety (more features) could improve claim loss modeling but requires collaborating on data.
- However, directly sharing raw data raises privacy concerns and is often not possible.

Proposed Solution:
- Use federated learning (FL) as a privacy-enhancing technique to enable collaborative modeling without sharing raw data. 
- Apply horizontal FL to increase data volume by training across multiple companies with common features but distinct observations.
- Apply vertical FL to increase data variety by training across an insurance company and InsurTech with common observations but distinct features.

Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrate that FL can improve claim loss modeling over models trained on local siloed data.
- Horizontal FL across two insurance companies reduces claim loss forecasting error, benefiting from more observations.  
- Vertical FL between an insurance company and InsurTech also reduces error, benefiting from more features.
- The framework provides a foundation for expanding privacy-preserving collaborations in other insurance use cases like fraud detection and catastrophe modeling.
- Results show FL enables performance gains from collaboration while protecting against risks of sharing raw data.

In summary, the paper proposes federated learning as a solution to improve insurance claim loss modeling by increasing data volume and variety through collaborative modeling, while mitigating privacy risks from sharing raw data. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
