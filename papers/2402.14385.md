# [WindDragon: Enhancing wind power forecasting with Automated Deep   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14385)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Wind power is critical for meeting net zero emissions targets but its variability poses grid integration challenges. Accurate forecasting of wind power generation is thus essential for balancing supply and demand. 
- Existing methods typically utilize wind speed point forecasts. However, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models provide richer spatial wind speed map forecasts that are largely unexploited.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes WindDragon, an automated deep learning framework to forecast short-term national wind power using NWP wind speed maps as input.
- WindDragon adapts the DRAGON automated ML system to restrict the search space to constrained deep learning architectures suited for spatial wind map regression. An evolutionary algorithm optimizes both the architecture topology and hyperparameters.
- The model spatially aggregates regional wind power forecasts derived from regional NWP wind maps. This accounts for uneven wind farm distribution.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that using full spatial NWP maps significantly improves forecast accuracy over baselines utilizing only aggregated wind speed statistics.
- WindDragon outperforms conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, establishing automated ML as a superior approach for wind power forecasting from weather maps.  
- Analysis across 12 French regions shows WindDragon reduces error by 6% (22MW) over next best method, corresponding to annual energy savings for 32,000 households.
- WindDragon provides a broadly applicable automated framework for wind and potentially solar power forecasting using spatial meteorological predictions.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and practical contributions in leveraging NWP wind speed maps for improved renewable forecasting via automated deep learning.
