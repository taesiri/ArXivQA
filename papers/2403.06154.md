# [GlanceVAD: Exploring Glance Supervision for Label-efficient Video   Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06154)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video anomaly detection aims to detect abnormal events in videos, which has applications in surveillance and video content analysis.
- Fully supervised methods require precise temporal boundary labeling of anomalies, which is very costly. 
- Weakly supervised methods only use video-level labels, suffering from context bias and unsatisfactory detection accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new labeling paradigm called "glance annotation", where annotators randomly label a single frame per anomaly.
- Glance annotation is cost-effective and provides useful localization guidance compared to weak supervision.
- The paper manuallyglance-annotates two large datasets UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. 
- It proposes a Temporal Gaussian Splatting method to generate smooth pseudo-labels from sparse glance annotations to train the model.

Main Contributions:
- First work to explore glance annotation for video anomaly detection task. Provides standardized glance annotation procedure and benchmarks.
- Proposes Temporal Gaussian Splatting to reliably expand glance labels to pseudo-labels using dynamic mining and Gaussian rendering.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime (91.96% AUC) and XD-Violence (89.40% AP), significantly outperforming weakly supervised methods.
- Demonstrates the trade-off between annotation cost and performance compared to full weakly supervised setting.
- The proposed GlanceVAD approach is generalizable to different MIL-based baseline methods.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient glance annotation paradigm for video anomaly detection and an effective GlanceVAD model to exploit such annotations. It sets new state-of-the-art while requiring fewer anomaly localization annotations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel glance supervision approach for video anomaly detection, which only requires annotating a single frame per anomaly event to achieve strong performance while keeping labeling costs low.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing a new labeling paradigm for video anomaly detection task called "glance annotation", where annotators randomly mark a frame within the time interval of an abnormal event. This is more efficient than fully supervised labeling of temporal boundaries.

2. Providing manual glance annotations for two large video anomaly detection datasets - UCF-Crime and XD-Violence.

3. Proposing a novel Temporal Gaussian Splatting method to obtain smooth and dense pseudo-labels from sparse glance annotations. This enables reliable initialization and progressive updates of Gaussian anomaly kernels during training.

4. Presenting GlanceVAD method based on Temporal Gaussian Splatting that can be inserted into existing MIL-based weakly supervised methods. When tested across various baselines, GlanceVAD significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

5. Demonstrating the excellent trade-off between annotation cost and model performance achieved by the proposed glance annotation and GlanceVAD method.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the glance annotation paradigm and GlanceVAD method to achieve improved performance in video anomaly detection with lower annotation cost.

The paper introduces a new labeling paradigm called "glance annotation" for video anomaly detection, which provides a single frame click within each abnormal event. This is a form of weak or point supervision that is more efficient than detailed temporal boundary labeling. The proposed GlanceVAD method leverages Gaussian kernels and splatting to generate pseudo-labels from the glance annotations to train the model. Multiple instance learning techniques are employed as baselines. The goal is to achieve better accuracy and lower annotation cost compared to existing weakly supervised video anomaly detection approaches.
