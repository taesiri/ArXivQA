# [AI Code Generators for Security: Friend or Foe?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01219)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in AI code generators like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer make them easily accessible to malicious actors to automate attacks. However, they can also help security analysts in tasks like penetration testing, red teaming, threat analysis, etc.  
- There is a lack of security-focused datasets to evaluate these AI tools for security use cases and support further research.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper discusses potential use cases of AI code generators for security analysts in areas like attack surface analysis, OSINT, exploit development, and post-exploitation activities.
- The authors create a new dataset "violent-python" with 1,372 samples of offensive Python code snippets from a security book, with corresponding natural language descriptions at line, block and function levels.
- They evaluate three AI code generators - CodeBERT, GitHub Copilot, and Amazon CodeWhisperer on this dataset in terms of edit distance to the ground truth code.

Key Contributions:
- Identification of several offensive security use cases where AI code generators can assist analysts.  
- Introduction of a new security-focused benchmark dataset for evaluating AI code generators.
- Experimental comparison showing CodeBERT outperforms public tools when fine-tuned on security data, and GitHub Copilot provides best results among public tools.
- Insights like fine-tuning, choice of tool, and granularity of natural language descriptions impact performance of AI code generators for security.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the potential of AI code generators for offensive security use cases through a new dataset and evaluation of state-of-the-art tools, while also highlighting research challenges like need for more security-focused data.
