# [Value function interference and greedy action selection in value-based   multi-objective reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06266)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends regular RL to problems with multiple conflicting objectives represented as vector rewards. MORL methods like multi-objective Q-learning learn vector value functions and use a scalarization function to select greedy actions.

- This paper identifies an issue called "value function interference" where the learned vector values for a state-action pair can be inconsistent with the optimal policy, especially for non-linear scalarization functions. 

- This happens because multiple actions can map to the same scalarized utility value but have different vector value distributions. Random tie-breaking between such actions creates stochasticity in the updates to the value function, leading to interference.

- Value function interference is most problematic when optimizing for expected scalarised return (ESR) in stochastic environments, but can even happen in deterministic environments when optimizing for scalarised expected return (SER).

Proposed Solution:
- For deterministic environments, use deterministic (non-random) tie-breaking when multiple actions have equal utility. This reduces but does not eliminate the problem.

- For stochastic environments, use distributional MORL methods that model the distribution of returns, allowing the agent to accurately estimate ESR utilities.

Contributions:
- Identifies and defines the issue of value function interference in MORL
- Provides a simple example to demonstrate how it arises 
- Empirically evaluates non-random tie-breaking as a partial solution
- Shows value function interference occurs in both stochastic (ESR) and deterministic (SER) cases
- Proposes distributional MORL as a more general solution

The key insight is that in MORL, knowing the expected vector returns is not always enough to determine the optimal policy - you need to consider the distribution of returns. Avoiding random tie-breaking and using distributional representations can help address this.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper identifies and demonstrates "value function interference", an issue in multi-objective reinforcement learning where learning estimated mean vector rewards is insufficient to identify optimal actions, especially for stochastic environments and expected scalarised return optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper identifies and defines a new issue called "value function interference" that can arise in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) methods based on learning vector value functions. Specifically, if the user's utility function maps very different vector-valued returns to similar scalar utility values, this can cause interference in the value function learning process, leading to slower learning or convergence to suboptimal policies. The paper provides examples and empirical demonstrations of how this interference manifests, and shows that using deterministic rather than random tie-breaking of greedy actions can mitigate but not eliminate the problem. More generally, the paper advocates for using distributional MORL methods or policy search methods to avoid the issue of value function interference altogether.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying, defining and demonstrating this previously overlooked issue affecting an important class of MORL algorithms, along with providing initial suggestions for potential solutions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
- Value function interference 
- Expected Scalarised Return (ESR)
- Scalarised Expected Return (SER)  
- Q-learning
- Action selection
- Utility functions
- Distributional reinforcement learning
- Value-based methods
- Policy search methods

The paper examines an issue called "value function interference" that can arise in multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly value-based methods like multi-objective Q-learning. This interference can prevent the agent from learning the optimal policy. The concepts of Expected Scalarised Return (ESR) and Scalarised Expected Return (SER) are also important distinctions made in multi-objective problems. Approaches like distributional reinforcement learning and policy search methods are suggested to help address the value function interference issue. Key terms also include the multi-objective MDP framework and concepts around defining utility functions and action selection in MORL.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses the issue of "value function interference" in multi-objective reinforcement learning. Can you explain in more detail what is meant by this term and why it can be problematic when using value-based MORL methods? 

2. The paper demonstrates value function interference arising in both stochastic and deterministic environments. What is the key difference in the nature of the interference arising in these two types of environments?

3. The paper proposes the use of deterministic (non-random) tie-breaking when selecting between multiple greedy actions as a way to mitigate value function interference. Can you outline the limitations of this approach in fully resolving the issues? When would it be more or less effective?

4. The paper links the likelihood of incorrect convergence due to value function interference to the setting of key hyperparameters like learning rate and exploration rate. Can you explain the reasoning behind why certain parameter settings make this more likely to occur?

5. The empirical results show that a low-index preference in deterministic tie-breaking leads to better results than a high-index preference. Why might this occur, and does it suggest that the improvement is partly due to induced bias rather than purely resolving the root issue?

6. For the stochastic example environment, the paper advocates the use of distributional RL to enable the agent to directly estimate the Expected Scalarised Return. Can you explain how maintaining a distribution over possible vector returns allows the calculation of ESR?

7. The paper argues policy search methods may avoid issues with value function interference. What are the key strengths and weaknesses of using policy search compared to value-based methods for MORL? When might each be preferred?

8. The paper links non-linear scalarisation functions to greater likelihood of value function interference. Why do you think non-linear functions lead to this? Would you expect the degree of non-linearity to correlate to severity of interference issues?

9. The example highlights interference even for a simple multi-objective multi-armed bandit (MOMAB). Do you think similar issues could arise for single-objective MABs in some configurations, or is multi-objectivity key?

10. The paper considers Expected Scalarised Return and Scalarised Expected Return criteria. Are you aware of any other optimisation criteria for MORL that might avoid value function interference issues? What are their key strengths and weaknesses?
