# [Robust Sparse Estimation for Gaussians with Optimal Error under Huber   Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10416)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the problem of robust estimation of structured Gaussian distributions, specifically focusing on sparse mean estimation, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression. The goal is to develop estimation algorithms that are resilient to outliers and achieve the optimal error guarantee of O(ε) under Huber's contamination model, where an ε fraction of samples may be adversarially corrupted. 

Prior computational efficient algorithms incurred error guarantees of Ω(ε √log(1/ε)), which is suboptimal. The paper aims to develop the first efficient robust estimators with optimal error for these structured estimation tasks.

Key Contributions:

1. Robust Sparse Mean Estimation: The paper gives the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves the optimal O(ε) error for estimating a k-sparse mean vector of a Gaussian under Huber contamination. The sample complexity is (k2/ε2)polylog(d/ε).

2. Robust Sparse PCA: The paper provides the first polynomial time algorithm with optimal O(ε) error for robust PCA under a spike covariance model in both the sparse and dense settings. 

3. Robust Sparse Linear Regression: The paper gives an efficient algorithm that achieves the optimal O(εσ) error for robust sparse linear regression with k-sparse coefficients under Huber contamination.

Techniques:
- A novel multidimensional filtering method to identify outliers in the sparse setting.
- A reduction from robust Gaussian PCA to robust Gaussian mean estimation while preserving near optimal error guarantees.  
- Adapt prior dense robust estimation techniques to the sparse setting using insights from relaxations based on Semidefinite programming and matrix factorization.

The paper significantly advances the theoretical understanding of computationally efficient robust structured estimation under sparsity. The new techniques could find applications more broadly in statistics and machine learning.
