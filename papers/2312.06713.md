# [TeTriRF: Temporal Tri-Plane Radiance Fields for Efficient Free-Viewpoint   Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06713)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have enabled high-quality free-viewpoint video (FVV) experiences. However, current methods have significant storage requirements and computational complexity for generation and rendering, limiting their broader application. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Temporal Tri-Plane Radiance Fields (TeTriRF), a novel approach to generate FVV with extremely compact storage while maintaining efficient generation and rendering.

Main Contributions:

1. A training strategy that groups consecutive frames and regularizes them to achieve temporally consistent and low-entropy representations for effective compression. This also accelerates training.

2. A hybrid representation with tri-planes and voxel grids that balances compactness and effectiveness by capturing high-dimensional appearance features in planes while enabling efficient sampling through the grid.

3. A compression pipeline leveraging video codecs to achieve over 10x compression, storing high-quality FVV in just 10-100 KB per frame. This is enabled by the temporal consistency and sparsity of the representations.  

4. A lightweight deferred renderer, decoding radiance using shallow MLPs. Along with hardware video decoding, this enables real-time rendering.

5. Experiments show the approach achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, efficient training and rendering speeds, while generating high quality novel views comparable to existing methods. This takes a step towards streaming and interactive FVV.

In summary, TeTriRF introduces representations and techniques tailored for extremely compact and efficient dynamic scene modeling to push the boundaries of neural radiance field based free-viewpoint video.
