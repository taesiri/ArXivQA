 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel scalable end-to-end joint planning and control framework for multi-robot systems. Specifically:

- The paper seamlessly integrates planning and control into a unified optimization framework using factor graphs. This reduces optimization times and inter-module communication delays.

- The approach prioritizes scalability, allowing it to easily accommodate larger robot teams and more complex environments without substantially increasing computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate linear scaling in computation time with increasing numbers of robots and obstacles.

- The method is evaluated extensively in simulations and on real hardware. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like MPC in metrics including optimization time, path deviation, distance to goal, etc.

- The approach is highly extensible - adding new constraints or modifying dynamics is easy by adding/modifying factors and the motion model in the factor graph formulation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper mentions that the motion of the centroid is split into translation and rotation stages. What is the motivation behind this split and how does it simplify the optimization problem? Does it introduce any drawbacks?

2) This paper utilizes factor graphs to jointly optimize the control and planning problem. What are the main benefits of using factor graphs over other optimization frameworks like quadratic programming or convex optimization? How does it specifically help with scalability?

3) The motion model of individual robots and the centroid is defined in equations (1) and (2). What assumptions are being made in the derivation of these models? How accurate are these models to real robot motion?

4) Soft constraints are used to represent the motion model and obstacle avoidance factors in the factor graph formulation. What are the advantages of soft constraint representation over hard constraints? How well does this approximation work?

5) The complexity analysis shows polynomial scaling for both the proposed method and MPC. However, the experiments demonstrate substantially better scaling for the number of robots and obstacles using factor graphs. What causes this discrepancy between theoretical and empirical analysis?  

6) This paper claims the proposed approach is highly extensible for adding new constraints and dynamics. Can you provide some examples of new factors that can be easily incorporated and how will they be defined?

7) One of the metrics used is inter-robot distance errors. Why is this an important metric for collaborative transportation? Are there other relevant metrics that can be used? 

8) For the experiments, an exhaustive search is done over parameters to find the best results. Is there a more principled way this parameter tuning can be performed? How sensitive is the performance to changes in parameters?

9) The hardware experiments demonstrate robustness to various disturbances. What modifications need to be made to the algorithm formulation to explicitly incorporate uncertainty in sensing and actuation?

10) A limitation mentioned is that the initial formation of the robots needs to be known. What are some ways that this requirement can be relaxed in future work?
