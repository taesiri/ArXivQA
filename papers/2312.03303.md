# [Dyport: Dynamic Importance-based Hypothesis Generation Benchmarking   Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03303)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel benchmarking framework called Dyport for evaluating biomedical hypothesis generation systems. The key innovation is integrating curated biomedical datasets into a dynamic graph and quantifying the importance of discoveries to assess not just accuracy but potential impact. Specifically, the pipeline processes and maps concepts from various databases into a unified format, connects literature concepts via co-occurrences, and constructs annual network snapshots. Importance scores are then calculated for edges using integrated gradients to measure predictive influence, graph centralities for structural impact, and citation counts for literature impact. These scores enable stratified evaluation of systems on different levels of importance. The benchmark is demonstrated on several link prediction methods and shown to enable more nuanced assessment than traditional benchmarks. Key advantages are leveraging curated data for realism, incorporating temporality to enable time-slicing evaluations, and quantifying importance for relevance. Intended applications are assessing automated biomedical hypothesis generation systems to expand impactful scientific discovery. The code and data are open-source to facilitate adoption.
