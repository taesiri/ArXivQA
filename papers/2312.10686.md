# [Out-of-Distribution Detection in Long-Tailed Recognition with Calibrated   Outlier Class Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10686)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection work well on balanced datasets, but become ineffective in long-tailed recognition (LTR) scenarios. In LTR, there are two key issues: 
1) OOD samples are often wrongly classified into head classes (majority classes) with high confidence.  
2) Tail-class (minority class) samples are often treated as OOD samples.

Recent methods attempt to fit a prior distribution of auxiliary/pseudo OOD data to the long-tailed in-distribution (ID) data. But it is difficult to obtain an accurate prior given the unknowingness of real OOD data and heavy class imbalance in LTR.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces a novel approach called calibrated outlier class learning (COCL) that learns an outlier class to encapsulate OOD samples, eliminating the need for a prior distribution. The key challenge is tackling the confusion between OOD, head and tail class samples when learning this outlier class. 

To address this, COCL has two main components:

1) Debiased large margin learning, which includes:
   - OOD-aware tail class prototype learning to reduce bias towards OOD when classifying tail samples  
   - Debiased head class learning to reduce bias towards head classes when detecting OOD samples

2) Outlier-class-aware logit calibration to enhance long-tailed classification confidence and OOD detection by utilizing the logit of the outlier class to calibrate predictions.

Main Contributions:
- Show that outlier class learning is more effective for OOD detection in LTR than fitting a prior distribution when auxiliary OOD data is available
- Introduce a novel COCL approach with debiased large margin learning and outlier-class-aware calibration that effectively mitigates biases towards head and OOD samples
- Achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance in LTR while also improving classification accuracy on ID data, demonstrated on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT and ImageNet-LT

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in tackling the important but challenging problem of OOD detection in long-tailed recognition scenarios. The proposed COCL approach substantially advances the state-of-the-art.
