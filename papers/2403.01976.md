## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

The paper introduces SciAssess, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analyzing scientific literature. 

Problem:
Existing benchmarks for assessing LLMs are limited in their ability to fully test competencies in the scientific domain, especially for complex comprehension and multimodal data scenarios. There is a need for more rigorous benchmarks tailored to scientific contexts.

Solution:
SciAssess focuses on assessing LLMs across three core abilities - memorization, comprehension, and analysis/reasoning of scientific content. It covers diverse tasks from fields like general chemistry, organic materials, alloy materials and drug discovery.  

Key Details:
- SciAssess tests LLM skills in handling factual questions, extracting tables/data, open-ended generation, etc.
- It uses metrics like accuracy, value recall, model-graded scores to evaluate performance.  
- Experiments compare models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini on the benchmark.
- Analysis examines domain-specific performance, influence of multimodal data.

Contributions:  
- More comprehensive LLM assessment for scientific literature analysis.  
- Reveals current capabilities and limitations of leading LLMs.
- Provides diagnostic insights to further advance LLM proficiency for scientific research.
- Valuable benchmark resource for model selection and optimization.

In summary, SciAssess offers a much-needed, rigorous benchmark to deeply evaluate LLMs on scientific literature tasks, supporting progress in this niche but important area of language model development. The analysis provides helpful directions for improving model design and training approaches.
