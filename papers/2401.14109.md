# [CompactifAI: Extreme Compression of Large Language Models using   Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14109)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities in generative AI, but their immense size leads to huge training/inference costs, massive energy demands, and limitations for on-site deployment. 
- Existing compression methods like pruning, distillation, low-rank approximation and quantization are relatively brute-force - they truncate the number of parameters/neurons without considering model accuracy or interpretation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new LLM compression technique called "CompactifAI" based on quantum-inspired tensor networks (TNs). 
- It involves "tensorizing" the self-attention and MLP layers of LLMs using matrix product operators (MPOs). This truncates model correlations to only the most relevant ones.
- The compression rate is controlled by the MPO bond dimension. Lower dimension = more compression but lower accuracy.
- The tensorized model is then rapidly retrained to regain accuracy lost due to compression.

Main Contributions:
- First application of TN-based compression to large language models. Enables interpretable, controllable compression superior to existing techniques.
- Compression + quantization reduced LlaMA-2 7B model to 15% of original size, while retraining regained 90% of original accuracy. 
- Drastically cuts training time, energy use and costs while allowing on-site deployment.
- Compatible with other methods like pruning/distillation for further compression.
- Opens the door to democratization and wide deployment of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called CompactifAI that uses quantum-inspired tensor networks to compress large language models to a fraction of their original size while still maintaining most of their accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new compression method for Large Language Models (LLMs) called "CompactifAI". Specifically:

- CompactifAI is based on using quantum-inspired Tensor Networks (TNs) to decompose the weight matrices in the self-attention and MLP layers of LLMs into structures called Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). 

- The key innovation is that this targets the correlation space in the models rather than simply truncating the number of neurons. The bond dimension parameter χ allows controllable and interpretable compression by truncating less relevant correlations.

- As a benchmark, the authors show CompactifAI can compress the 7 billion parameter LlaMA-2 model down to 30% of its original size (plus additional 2x from quantization) while still recovering over 90% of the original performance after brief retraining.

- This provides a more refined compression technique compared to methods like pruning and distillation, with better control and compatibility with other methods. It helps enable democratization and on-device deployment of Large Language Models.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal and demonstration of the CompactifAI quantum-inspired tensor network compression technique for radically reducing the size of Large Language Models in a controlled and interpretable way.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large Language Models (LLMs): The paper focuses on compressing large pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, LlaMA, BERT, etc.

- Compression techniques: Methods discussed include quantization, distillation, pruning, low-rank approximation, and the new proposed tensor network compression method.

- Tensor Networks (TNs): The core compression technique proposed is based on quantum-inspired tensor networks, especially Matrix Product Operators (MPOs).

- Bond dimension: A key parameter $\chi$ that controls the compression rate and accuracy trade-off. Lower bond dimension leads to higher compression but lower accuracy.

- Retraining: The paper emphasizes the importance of retraining the compressed model to recover accuracy lost during compression. 

- Distributed training: They use a multi-GPU distributed training setup which is faster for the compressed model.

- Benchmark: The method is benchmarked on the LlaMA-2 model for text summarization task on Gigaword and XSum datasets. Compression rate, accuracy, training time etc. are analyzed.

In summary, the key focus is on compressing LLMs using tensor network methods, analyzing the accuracy vs compression trade-offs, and showing faster distributed retraining.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the proposed method is the first application of tensor networks for compressing large language models. What modifications were required to adapt tensor networks for language model compression compared to their traditional application in deep learning?

2. How does the correlation space compression used in this method for language model compression differ fundamentally from traditional compression techniques like pruning and distillation that focus on reducing the number of parameters?

3. The bond dimension χ serves as a truncation parameter that controls the compression rate versus accuracy trade-off. What guidelines can be provided for selecting the optimal value of χ for a given language model and application? 

4. Retraining is an important aspect of recovering accuracy after tensor network compression. What are some of the reasons that retraining the compressed model is much more efficient than training the original uncompressed model?

5. What modifications could be tried in the simple update step while decomposing the weight matrices into matrix product operators to better optimize the initial tensor network for accuracy before retraining?

6. How could techniques like higher order singular value decomposition be used to capture higher order correlations when decomposing the weight matrices into tensor networks? What benefits might this provide?

7. The paper demonstrates the method on the LlaMA-2 model. What architectural modifications would be required to apply this compression technique to other popular language models like GPT-3 and BERT?  

8. How can this tensor network compression approach be combined effectively with other techniques like distillation and quantization for enhanced compression rates?

9. What metrics beyond Rouge scores should be analyzed to fully evaluate the impact of tensor network compression on language model performance for different tasks?

10. The paper speculates that compressed models could enable on-premise deployment. What engineering challenges need to be resolved to make compressed large language models truly deployable on embedded and edge devices?
