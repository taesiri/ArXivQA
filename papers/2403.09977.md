# [EfficientVMamba: Atrous Selective Scan for Light Weight Visual Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09977)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing lightweight neural network architectures like CNNs and Transformers face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. CNNs focus on local feature extraction but sacrifice resolution. Transformers offer global reach but increase computational complexity to O(N^2). Overcoming this ongoing trade-off remains challenging for resource-constrained applications.

Method: 
This paper proposes EfficientVMamba, a lightweight visual state space model architecture. State space models (SSMs) were recently shown to reduce global information extraction complexity to O(N) for sequences. 

Key ideas:
1) Introduce an "atrous-based selective scan" strategy involving efficient skip sampling and regrouping of patches. This reduces tokens processed from N to N/p^2 per scan while retaining global receptive field.

2) Design an Efficient Visual State Space (EVSS) block fusing SSM and CNN branches. The SSM branch efficiently extracts global features via the proposed scanning strategy. The CNN branch targets local features. Both branches connect to a squeeze-excitation block for feature rebalancing.

3) Use an "inverted fusion" design placing EVSS blocks early to leverage global modeling at high resolutions. Computationally cheaper inverted residual blocks are used in later layers for local modeling in low resolutions.

Contributions:
1) The proposed atrous scanning strategy reduces SSM computation from O(N) to O(N/p^2) while retaining global receptive field.

2) The EVSS block synergistically fuses global (SSM) and local (CNN) feature extraction followed by dynamic rebalancing.

3) Inverted fusion places EVSS blocks early to capture global context at high resolutions and cheaper convolutional blocks later.

4) Extensive experiments show EfficientVMamba variants improve efficiency and accuracy over state-of-the-art lightweight models on image classification, detection and segmentation.

In summary, EfficientVMamba explores the potential of visual SSMs for lightweight model design, proposing novel scanning strategies and architectural innovations that balance accuracy and efficiency. Results highlight its competitiveness as an efficient, general-purpose visual model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes EfficientVMamba, a lightweight visual state space model architecture that efficiently combines global and local feature extraction through an atrous-based selective scanning strategy and dual pathway blocks with inverted residual insertion, achieving strong performance across vision tasks with reduced computational complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an atrous-based selective scanning strategy called Efficient 2D Scanning (ES2D). This uses efficient skip sampling and regrouping of patches to reduce computational complexity while preserving global receptive fields. 

2. It introduces the Efficient Visual State Space (EVSS) block, which synergistically merges global and local feature representations using the ES2D module and an additional convolutional branch. This is enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks to rebalance the features.

3. It proposes an "inverted" insertion of efficient residual blocks, placing them in the later stages of the model after the EVSS blocks in the early stages. This deviates from prior designs and is shown to improve performance.

4. It presents EfficientVMamba, a lightweight state-space network architecture that effectively combines global and local information extraction to improve the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show it reduces computational complexity while achieving competitive performance on image classification, detection and segmentation tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is the EfficientVMamba architecture that uses novel techniques like ES2D scanning, EVSS blocks, and inverted residual insertion to develop an efficient visual state space model that balances global and local feature learning.
