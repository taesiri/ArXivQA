# [BoxSnake: Polygonal Instance Segmentation with Box Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11630)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can effective polygon-based instance segmentation be achieved with only box annotations? The authors note that existing box-supervised instance segmentation methods mainly focus on mask-based frameworks, but there is no deep learning-based method for weakly-supervised polygonal instance segmentation. They propose a new end-to-end training technique called BoxSnake to tackle this problem and achieve polygonal instance segmentation using only box annotations.The key ideas and contributions are:- Designing a point-based unary loss to constrain the bounding box of predicted polygons using box-based IoU. - Proposing a distance-aware pairwise loss with local and global terms to encourage the predicted polygon to align with object boundaries. They also devise a method to transform the polygon regression problem into a classification problem to facilitate the pairwise loss calculation.- Achieving competitive performance on COCO and Cityscapes datasets compared to mask-based weakly-supervised methods, and even surpassing some fully-supervised approaches.In summary, the central hypothesis is that effective polygon-based instance segmentation can be achieved with only cheap and weak box supervision through the proposed BoxSnake method. The experimental results on COCO and Cityscapes datasets validate this hypothesis.
