# [Third-Party Language Model Performance Prediction from Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Language model systems can now follow arbitrary natural language instructions, but there is limited understanding of the limitations of these capabilities. Users currently have no way to know if a system will perform well on a new instruction.   
- This lack of transparency is concerning as users may rely on systems for tasks they are incapable of adequately performing.

Proposed Solution  
- The paper proposes a "third party performance prediction" framework where a separate model predicts the performance of an instruction-following system on a task while only assuming access to its inputs and outputs.
- Performance predictors are trained by regressing quantitative metrics (e.g. ROUGE-L, Exact Match) on the natural language instructions.
- Evaluates on variety of instruction-following models and factors like model size, training tasks, prompt format.

Key Findings
- Performance prediction remains very challenging across all setups (RMSE ~20+ for 0-100 metrics). 
- Increasing factors like model size, number of training tasks, adding demonstrations do not meaningfully improve prediction.
- Results underscore that much progress still needs to be made in designing systems whose limitations can be accurately predicted for transparency.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that predicting the performance of instruction-following language models on new tasks is very difficult under current methods. Significant work remains to build natural language systems whose capabilities and limitations can be reliably revealed to users to promote transparency and safety.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework for training separate "third party" models to predict the performance of instruction-following language models on unseen tasks based only on the task instructions, finding that performance prediction remains very challenging across various model sizes, metrics, training procedures, and other factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a third party performance prediction framework, where a separate model is trained to predict the metric resulting from evaluating an instruction-following system on a task while assuming access only to its inputs and outputs at inference time. The goal is to empower users by giving them a sense of an instruction-following model's capabilities and limitations on new tasks, without needing to actually query the model itself. The authors perform experiments with various instruction-following models and performance predictors, examining factors like model size, number of training tasks, and prompt format. Their key finding is that third-party performance prediction remains very challenging, with none of the explored factors providing meaningful improvements to predictability. The paper underscores how much progress still needs to be made in designing instruction-following systems whose limitations can be accurately predicted and communicated transparently.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Instruction-following models - The paper focuses on analyzing language models that have been trained to follow natural language instructions to perform tasks. 

- Performance prediction - A main goal of the paper is to predict how well an instruction-following model will perform on a new, unseen task instruction. This involves training separate "performance predictor" models.

- Task-level prediction - The performance prediction is done at the level of full tasks that include an instruction and one or more instances, rather than individual instances. 

- Automated evaluation metrics - Metrics like ROUGE and Exact Match score are used to quantify an instruction-following model's performance on a task for use as prediction targets.

- Transparency - A motivation of the work is increasing transparency around the capabilities and limitations of instruction-following models.

- User empowerment - The proposed third-party prediction framework aims to empower users to better understand system limitations before attempting new tasks.

- Instruction datasets - Datasets of tasks with natural language instructions like SuperNI and BIG-bench are used to evaluate and predict performance.

- Factors affecting predictability - The work analyzes factors like model scale, evaluation metric, prompt format, etc. and their effect on predictability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a third party performance prediction framework. What are the key motivations and potential benefits of such a framework compared to having the instruction-following system predict its own performance? How does this framework aim to empower users?

2. The paper treats performance prediction as a regression problem from natural language instructions to quantitative evaluation metrics. What are some potential limitations of formulating the problem in this manner? Could framing it as a classification task be more appropriate?

3. The choice of evaluation metric itself seems crucial yet challenging for arbitrary instructions. Beyond Exact Match, ROUGE-L, and loss, what other metrics could capture model performance in a generalizable way? How could multiple metrics be combined?

4. Data seems to be a clear bottleneck. Beyond simply collecting more instructions, how could synthetic or semi-synthetic instruction generation methods help create larger and more diverse performance prediction datasets? 

5. The paper explores predictor models at the RoBERTa scale. What modifications could be made to transformer architectures to make them better suited for mapping instructions to performance? How should the choice of predictor model differ based on the intended user?

6. How robust are the performance predictors to variations in how the instructions are phrased? Should the predictors aim to capture task-specific rather than instruction-specific behavior? How could paraphrasing methods help address this?

7. The analysis relies entirely on zero-shot performance. How would finetuning the instruction-following models on the test set instructions affect predictability? Would it improve or harm it?

8. Could encoder-decoder instruction-following models exhibit different predictability properties compared to decoder-only models? How could the hidden representations of encoders help performance prediction?

9. The paper predicts automated metrics - could predictor models instead forecast human judgments of quality by predicting metrics from human evaluations? Would human judgments be more predictable?

10. What modifications should be made to the analysis pipeline if predicting the performance of models trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback instead of supervised finetuning?
