# [Third-Party Language Model Performance Prediction from Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Language model systems can now follow arbitrary natural language instructions, but there is limited understanding of the limitations of these capabilities. Users currently have no way to know if a system will perform well on a new instruction.   
- This lack of transparency is concerning as users may rely on systems for tasks they are incapable of adequately performing.

Proposed Solution  
- The paper proposes a "third party performance prediction" framework where a separate model predicts the performance of an instruction-following system on a task while only assuming access to its inputs and outputs.
- Performance predictors are trained by regressing quantitative metrics (e.g. ROUGE-L, Exact Match) on the natural language instructions.
- Evaluates on variety of instruction-following models and factors like model size, training tasks, prompt format.

Key Findings
- Performance prediction remains very challenging across all setups (RMSE ~20+ for 0-100 metrics). 
- Increasing factors like model size, number of training tasks, adding demonstrations do not meaningfully improve prediction.
- Results underscore that much progress still needs to be made in designing systems whose limitations can be accurately predicted for transparency.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that predicting the performance of instruction-following language models on new tasks is very difficult under current methods. Significant work remains to build natural language systems whose capabilities and limitations can be reliably revealed to users to promote transparency and safety.
