# [Using a Waffle Iron for Automotive Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether it is possible to develop a 3D backbone for automotive point cloud semantic segmentation that reaches state-of-the-art performance without using sparse 3D convolutions. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- Standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, despite being a priori unfit for processing large 3D point clouds, are actually sufficient to construct a high-performing 3D backbone for this task.

- Such a backbone built with basic building blocks can compete with methods relying on sparse 3D convolutions, which are more complex and less readily available across frameworks/hardware.

So in summary, the main research question is whether you can build a simple yet effective 3D backbone using standard dense layers to match the performance of state-of-the-art techniques relying on sparse convolutions for this application. The paper aims to demonstrate this is feasible.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a new 3D backbone called WaffleIron for point cloud semantic segmentation, which is built using standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions rather than sparse 3D convolutions. 

- Showing that this architecture can achieve state-of-the-art performance on automotive datasets like SemanticKITTI and nuScenes without relying on sparse convolutions.

- Demonstrating that tools like MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, which are more broadly available across frameworks compared to sparse 3D convolutions, are actually sufficient to build high-performing 3D perception models.

- Providing an easy-to-implement backbone alternative that is competitive with top methods relying on sparse convolutions, especially when those operations are not readily available in the framework or hardware.

- Highlighting how WaffleIron has easy-to-tune hyperparameters, with performance increasing with network width and depth and being stable over a wide range of 2D grid resolutions.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and demonstrating how their WaffleIron backbone can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on automotive point clouds without needing sparse 3D convolutions, using standard and easy-to-implement layers instead. This provides a competitive alternative approach to sparse convolution methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new 3D backbone network called WaffleIron for point cloud semantic segmentation of autonomous driving datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art performance using only standard MLPs and 2D convolutions rather than more complex sparse 3D convolutions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key things to consider when comparing this paper to other research in the field of automotive point cloud semantic segmentation:

- It proposes an alternative approach that does not rely on sparse 3D convolutions. As noted in the introduction, sparse 3D convolutions have become the dominant approach in many state-of-the-art methods for this task. The authors argue that developing a high-performance method without relying on sparse convolutions provides a useful alternative, especially when sparse convolutions may not be readily available.

- The backbone architecture is novel and based on standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, rather than more specialized layers tailored for point clouds. This simplicity could make the approach easy to implement and deploy.

- The performance achieved is very competitive with state-of-the-art methods on major benchmarks like SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Reaching top performance without sparse 3D convolutions helps demonstrate the viability of the proposed architecture.

- Compared to other projection-based methods, this approach does not seem to suffer the same performance gap relative to sparse convolution methods. The 2D projection strategy and architecture design appear to compensate for some of the weaknesses of pure projection-based approaches.

- The approach does not require complex components like attention mechanisms, dedicated point sampling/clustering layers, transformer architectures etc. This contributes to the simplicity and efficiency of the overall method compared to some recent works.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights into the impact of key design choices and hyperparameters. This helps situate the performance of the full method relative to variations.

Overall, this work presents a competitively performing but conceptually simple alternative to existing approaches for this task. The ability to reach top performance without relying on sparse 3D convolutions is a notable outcome compared to much of the related literature.
