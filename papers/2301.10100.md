# [Using a Waffle Iron for Automotive Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether it is possible to develop a 3D backbone for automotive point cloud semantic segmentation that reaches state-of-the-art performance without using sparse 3D convolutions. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- Standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, despite being a priori unfit for processing large 3D point clouds, are actually sufficient to construct a high-performing 3D backbone for this task.

- Such a backbone built with basic building blocks can compete with methods relying on sparse 3D convolutions, which are more complex and less readily available across frameworks/hardware.

So in summary, the main research question is whether you can build a simple yet effective 3D backbone using standard dense layers to match the performance of state-of-the-art techniques relying on sparse convolutions for this application. The paper aims to demonstrate this is feasible.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a new 3D backbone called WaffleIron for point cloud semantic segmentation, which is built using standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions rather than sparse 3D convolutions. 

- Showing that this architecture can achieve state-of-the-art performance on automotive datasets like SemanticKITTI and nuScenes without relying on sparse convolutions.

- Demonstrating that tools like MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, which are more broadly available across frameworks compared to sparse 3D convolutions, are actually sufficient to build high-performing 3D perception models.

- Providing an easy-to-implement backbone alternative that is competitive with top methods relying on sparse convolutions, especially when those operations are not readily available in the framework or hardware.

- Highlighting how WaffleIron has easy-to-tune hyperparameters, with performance increasing with network width and depth and being stable over a wide range of 2D grid resolutions.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing and demonstrating how their WaffleIron backbone can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on automotive point clouds without needing sparse 3D convolutions, using standard and easy-to-implement layers instead. This provides a competitive alternative approach to sparse convolution methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new 3D backbone network called WaffleIron for point cloud semantic segmentation of autonomous driving datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art performance using only standard MLPs and 2D convolutions rather than more complex sparse 3D convolutions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key things to consider when comparing this paper to other research in the field of automotive point cloud semantic segmentation:

- It proposes an alternative approach that does not rely on sparse 3D convolutions. As noted in the introduction, sparse 3D convolutions have become the dominant approach in many state-of-the-art methods for this task. The authors argue that developing a high-performance method without relying on sparse convolutions provides a useful alternative, especially when sparse convolutions may not be readily available.

- The backbone architecture is novel and based on standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, rather than more specialized layers tailored for point clouds. This simplicity could make the approach easy to implement and deploy.

- The performance achieved is very competitive with state-of-the-art methods on major benchmarks like SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Reaching top performance without sparse 3D convolutions helps demonstrate the viability of the proposed architecture.

- Compared to other projection-based methods, this approach does not seem to suffer the same performance gap relative to sparse convolution methods. The 2D projection strategy and architecture design appear to compensate for some of the weaknesses of pure projection-based approaches.

- The approach does not require complex components like attention mechanisms, dedicated point sampling/clustering layers, transformer architectures etc. This contributes to the simplicity and efficiency of the overall method compared to some recent works.

- The ablation studies provide useful insights into the impact of key design choices and hyperparameters. This helps situate the performance of the full method relative to variations.

Overall, this work presents a competitively performing but conceptually simple alternative to existing approaches for this task. The ability to reach top performance without relying on sparse 3D convolutions is a notable outcome compared to much of the related literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different projection strategies in the TokenMix layer of the WaffleIron backbone. The paper tested sequential projection along the x, y, and z axes as well as parallel projection, but other strategies could be investigated. 

- Reducing the computational requirements and accelerating inference time of WaffleIron. This could involve modifications like downsampling the point cloud more aggressively before input or reducing the number of point tokens.

- Applying WaffleIron to other 3D perception tasks beyond semantic segmentation, such as object detection or scene completion. The backbone may be well-suited for these applications too.

- Investigating whether the performance trends observed for WaffleIron generalize to other datasets beyond SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Testing on additional automotive datasets could reveal more about the approach.

- Combining WaffleIron with complementary representations like sparse convolutions or range images. Fusing the output of WaffleIron and other backbones may further improve accuracy.

- Adapting WaffleIron to process 4D data (e.g. from sequential lidar scans). This could require modifying the architecture to incorporate temporal modeling.

- Leveraging self-supervised pre-training approaches to initialize WaffleIron, rather than training from scratch. This could improve generalization.

Overall, the authors suggest exploring architectural variants of WaffleIron, reducing its computational footprint, applying it to new tasks and datasets, and combining it with other representations to further advance performance on automotive point cloud perception problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes WaffleIron, a new 3D backbone for point cloud semantic segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art performance without using sparse 3D convolutions. The backbone is composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and dense 2D convolutions applied directly on point tokens representing the input point cloud. The key component is the WaffleIron block which projects the points onto a 2D grid, applies 2D convolutions, and copies the features back to the points. Multiple WaffleIron blocks are stacked to form the full backbone. Experiments on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets show WaffleIron can match the performance of recent methods based on sparse 3D convolutions, despite using standard layers readily available in all frameworks. The results demonstrate dense 2D convolutions and MLPs are sufficient building blocks for top-performing 3D perception, providing an alternative to sparse 3D convolutions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D backbone called WaffleIron for semantic segmentation of point clouds from autonomous driving datasets. The backbone is built using standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, rather than sparse 3D convolutions which are commonly used in other state-of-the-art methods. The WaffleIron backbone works by taking in point tokens from an embedding layer, and updating the tokens through a series of token-mixing and channel-mixing layers. The key component is the WaffleIron block, which projects the points onto a 2D plane, runs 2D convolutions, and copies the features back to the 3D points. 

The authors show that despite the simple building blocks, WaffleIron can achieve state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes when properly trained. The hyperparameters like grid resolution and network width/depth are easy to tune. The backbone implementation only requires basic layers like batch normalization, 1D/2D convolutions and matrix multiplications directly on the point tokens. The performance and simplicity of WaffleIron makes it a compelling alternative to other backbones relying on more complex components like sparse 3D convolutions. The source code is available for easy reproduction of results.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:

The paper proposes WaffleIron, a novel 3D backbone for point cloud semantic segmentation that is built using standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions rather than sparse 3D convolutions. The backbone takes as input point tokens from an embedding layer and repeatedly updates the tokens using a token-mixing layer and a channel-mixing layer. The key component of the token-mixing layer is a novel block called WI block which projects the points onto a 2D grid, applies a feedforward network with 2D convolutions to mix features spatially, and copies the 2D features back to the 3D points. By repeating this token and channel mixing multiple times, the backbone updates the point representations and can achieve state-of-the-art performance on automotive datasets without relying on sparse 3D convolutions. The simple components make the backbone easy to implement while still reaching top results.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main points of this paper are:

- It proposes a new 3D backbone network called WaffleIron for point cloud semantic segmentation, especially aimed at automotive/autonomous driving datasets. 

- The goal is to create a backbone that achieves state-of-the-art performance but does not rely on sparse 3D convolutions, since those are not readily available in all frameworks/hardware.

- The WaffleIron backbone is built mainly using standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, which are more broadly supported. This makes the method easy to implement.

- It shows that despite using "simple" MLP and 2D conv layers, WaffleIron can achieve near state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, comparable to recent methods using sparse 3D convolutions.

- This demonstrates that standard MLPs and 2D convs are sufficient to build high-performing 3D segmentation networks, providing an alternative to sparse 3D convs.

- WaffleIron's main components are a token mixing step using 2D convs on projected point features, and a channel mixing step with shared MLPs. 

- It uses repeated applications of basic layers directly on point tokens, making the implementation straightforward.

So in summary, the key focus is designing a performant but easy-to-implement 3D backbone for point cloud segmentation that does not rely on sparse 3D convolutions, which can be hard to use in some environments. The results show this is viable using simple MLP and 2D conv building blocks.
