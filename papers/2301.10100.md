# [Using a Waffle Iron for Automotive Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether it is possible to develop a 3D backbone for automotive point cloud semantic segmentation that reaches state-of-the-art performance without using sparse 3D convolutions. The key hypotheses appear to be:- Standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, despite being a priori unfit for processing large 3D point clouds, are actually sufficient to construct a high-performing 3D backbone for this task.- Such a backbone built with basic building blocks can compete with methods relying on sparse 3D convolutions, which are more complex and less readily available across frameworks/hardware.So in summary, the main research question is whether you can build a simple yet effective 3D backbone using standard dense layers to match the performance of state-of-the-art techniques relying on sparse convolutions for this application. The paper aims to demonstrate this is feasible.
