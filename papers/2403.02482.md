# [MORBDD: Multiobjective Restricted Binary Decision Diagrams by Learning   to Sparsify](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02482)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on multiobjective integer linear programming (MOILP) problems, where the goal is to find the Pareto frontier that contains non-dominated solutions over multiple linear objectives subject to integer constraints. Exact methods like binary decision diagrams (BDDs) can find the full Pareto frontier, but take exponential time. The authors observe that only a small fraction of BDD nodes actually contribute to Pareto-optimal solutions. Hence, there is an opportunity to restrict the BDD to only those relevant nodes in order to enumerate the approximate Pareto frontier much faster. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes MORBDD, a machine learning-based approach to restrict BDDs by eliminating irrelevant nodes before extracting solutions. It has two main steps:

1) Train a binary classifier to score each BDD node based on features related to node properties. The classifier learns from training instances to predict whether a node will contribute to Pareto-optimal solutions or not. 

2) Perform stitching to reconnect the sparse BDD if eliminating nodes disconnects it. Two stitching methods are proposed - an ILP-based exact approach and a faster greedy heuristic.

Main Contributions:

- Formulates for the first time the problem of data-driven construction of restricted BDDs to accelerate multiobjective optimization.

- Introduces a classification + optimization framework called MORBDD that first sparsifies the BDD via ML then stitches it back together to ensure connectivity.

- On multiobjective knapsack problems, MORBDD finds over 60% of Pareto-optimal solutions 5-30x faster than the exact BDD approach and evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II, outperforming width-limited BDDs.

- Demonstrates promising generalization ability by training a size-agnostic model that performs well across problems with varying numbers of objectives and variables.

The key insight is to leverage machine learning on multiple problem instances to identify precisely the nodes that do not contribute to the Pareto frontier, eliminating them without affecting the correctness of solutions extracted from the restricted BDD later. The paper shows this is an effective heuristic to approximate the Pareto frontier much faster.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes MORBDD, a machine learning approach to restrict binary decision diagrams for multiobjective integer linear programs by training a classifier to eliminate nodes unlikely to contribute to Pareto solutions and then post-processing the sparse diagram via optimization to ensure feasibility of solutions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It formulates, for the first time, the problem of constructing restricted binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for the heuristic solution of multiobjective integer linear programs (MOILPs). It also proposes to study this problem in a data-driven setting.

2. It shows how the problem can be tackled by sparsifying a complete BDD before enumerating solutions. Eliminating BDD nodes that do not correspond to Pareto-optimal solutions does not affect the correctness of the enumeration procedure. Machine learning can help identify such irrelevant nodes in a data-driven manner. 

3. It introduces MORBDD, an ML-based BDD sparsifier, which operates in two stages - first, a trained binary classifier proposes nodes to eliminate based on training data. Second, an optimization algorithm post-processes the sparse BDD to enforce connectivity for feasible solution recovery.

4. It applies the methodology to multiobjective knapsack problems. MORBDD effectively sparsifies BDDs, leading to much faster solution enumeration and recovery of a substantial fraction of Pareto-optimal or near-Pareto solutions compared to baseline methods.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of MORBDD, an ML-based method to construct restricted BDDs that accelerate multiobjective optimization while preserving approximation quality. This is the first learning-based approach for heuristic multiobjective optimization over BDDs.

The paper introduces a new method called MORBDD that uses machine learning to construct restricted BDDs, which are sparser versions of binary decision diagrams, to efficiently approximate the Pareto frontier for multiobjective integer linear programs. Key ideas include training a classifier to eliminate nodes in the BDD unlikely to lead to Pareto-optimal solutions, post-processing the sparse BDD with optimization to ensure connectivity, and comparing against baselines like width-limited BDDs and NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm on multiobjective knapsack problem instances. The method performs very well in recovering most of the true Pareto frontier in a fraction of the time.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage approach consisting of a classification model followed by an optimization model. What is the motivation behind this two-stage approach rather than attempting to directly predict the optimal restricted BDD in one shot? What are the limitations of a direct prediction approach?

2. The paper utilizes XGBoost for the classification model. What are some pros and cons of using tree-based models versus neural networks in this application? Under what conditions might a neural network approach outperform XGBoost?  

3. The features used for the classification model incorporate information about the problem instance, current variable, current node, parent variable, and parent node. What is the intuition behind using features from these different scopes? Which feature scopes do you think provide the most predictive power?

4. The paper proposes two stitching algorithms - an MIP-based approach and a heuristic min-resistance approach. Compare and contrast these two algorithms in terms of computational complexity, optimality, and empirical performance. When is one preferred over the other?

5. The experimental evaluation focuses on the multiobjective knapsack problem. What properties of this problem make it amenable to the proposed approach? For what other combinatorial optimization problems could you foresee this method being applicable?

6. The paper compares against width-restricted BDDs and the NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these alternate approaches? Are there other heuristic methods you might suggest comparing against?

7. The paper evaluates performance using metrics like hypervolume and percentage of true Pareto frontier recovered. What other metrics could be used to benchmark the quality of the approximate Pareto frontiers?

8. How does the performance of the method change as the number of objectives increases? What modifications might be needed to scale the approach to problems with a very high number of objectives?  

9. The paper assumes access to training data in the form of problem instance BDDs and corresponding optimal restricted BDDs. In practice, how could this training data be generated?

10. The paper studies the multiobjective knapsack problem in a data-driven setting where problem parameters are randomly drawn. How could the ideas be extended to a contextual setting where problem parameters have structure that could be learned?
