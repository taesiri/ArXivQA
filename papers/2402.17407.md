# [A Neural Rewriting System to Solve Algorithmic Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modern neural networks still struggle to learn algorithmic procedures that require systematically applying rules to solve new instances of problems. 
- Tasks like simplifying symbolic formulas (involving lists, arithmetic, algebra) seem simple but require discovering and generalizing algorithmic processes.
- The paper investigates the extent to which neural networks can learn to perform this kind of systematic reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a neural architecture called the Neural Rewriting System inspired by symbolic rewriting systems. 
- It is composed of three specialized modules - Selector, Solver, and Combiner.
- The Selector identifies which sub-expression can be simplified. 
- The Solver simplifies the sub-expression by computing the result.
- The Combiner replaces the sub-expression with the computed result to produce a simplified version of the original expression.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new neural architecture designed for algorithmic reasoning tasks involving iterative rewriting of expressions.
- Achieves better performance compared to a state-of-the-art neural architecture (Neural Data Router) and large language model (GPT-4) on simplifying lists, arithmetic and algebraic expressions.
- Shows the value of decomposing problems into specialized modules over end-to-end approaches when systematic reasoning is required.
- Provides analysis of limitations - accurately selecting sub-expressions in very long formulas is the hardest task, limiting length generalization.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions around designing modular neural architectures that can perform systematic algorithmic reasoning for formula simplification problems. The proposed Neural Rewriting System outperforms existing approaches while also providing insights into current limitations.
