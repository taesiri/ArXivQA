# [Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained   Language Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05252)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:

How to improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models (LLMs), and effectively transfer such ability to smaller, more specialized models through dataset distillation. 

Specifically, the authors aim to:

- Define and establish the novel task of "constrained language planning", where the goal is to generate goal-oriented scripts that faithfully adhere to specific constraints. This advances language planning from just abstract goals to more complex, real-world specific goals.

- Evaluate LLMs on constrained language planning and show they tend to generate fluent but unfaithful scripts. Propose an "over-generate then filter" approach to improve faithfulness.

- Use the improved LLMs to generate a high-quality "CoScript" dataset of constrained language planning examples. Show this dataset can effectively train smaller models for the task, achieving performance comparable to LLMs.

So in summary, the core hypothesis is that LLMs can be improved at constrained language planning via better prompting and dataset distillation, enabling specialized smaller models to acquire strong constrained planning abilities. The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical experiments and analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It defines the novel problem of constrained language planning, which focuses on generating goal-oriented scripts for specific goals with multi-facet constraints, advancing language planning research beyond just abstract goals.

2. It proposes an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show this method boosts the constraint faithfulness of LLM-generated scripts by 26%. 

3. It uses the improved LLMs to generate a new constrained script dataset called CoScript, which contains 55,000 high-quality scripts. This dataset enables training specialized models for constrained language planning.

4. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on CoScript, like T5, can achieve strong constrained language planning performance comparable or even surpassing LLMs like GPT-3 and InstructGPT. This shows the value of the CoScript dataset.

5. The work provides empirical analysis of the constrained language planning behavior of LLMs. It identifies their common failure modes like ignoring constraints, guides the methodology design, and offers insights on this underexplored topic.

In summary, the key contribution is defining the novel constrained language planning problem, developing methods to improve LLM performance on it, constructing a dataset to train specialized models, and extensive empirical analysis around this new direction. The proposed techniques and dataset open up avenues for future research on language planning for complex goals.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve large language models on the novel task of constrained language planning, leveraging the approach to distill a dataset of 55,000 high-quality scripts called CoScript which can then be used to train smaller specialized models to achieve strong performance on planning toward goals with specific constraints.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on constrained language planning compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses on constrained language planning, which involves generating goal-oriented scripts that are faithful to specific constraints or requirements. Most prior work has focused on planning for more general, abstract goals without detailed constraints. So this paper tackles a new problem setting not extensively studied before.

- The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for constrained language planning in a few-shot setting. Other works have also explored leveraging LLMs for language planning, but usually only for abstract goals. This paper shows LLMs can do constrained planning but are prone to being unfaithful to constraints.

- To improve faithfulness, the paper uses an over-generate and filter approach. Other works have tried reframing or filtering methods to improve LLM outputs, but this paper applies it specifically to constrained planning.

- The paper distills a new dataset called CoScript from the LLM to train specialized models. Other script/planning datasets exist, but they lack specific goals with constraints. CoScript helps train specialized models for this new task.

- Experiments show the over-generate and filter approach improves LLMs for constrained planning. And models trained on CoScript, like T5, can surpass LLMs in some metrics. This demonstrates the value of the distilled dataset.

In summary, this paper introduces the novel problem of constrained language planning, proposes methods to improve LLM performance on it, and provides a new resource in CoScript to train specialized models. The experiments demonstrate approaches to overcome limitations of LLMs for this challenging planning task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several directions for future research:

- Exploring constrained language planning for more complex goals with multiple constraints. The specific goals in this work only have a single constraint inherited from the abstract goal. Studying how to plan for goals with complex, multi-faceted constraints would be an interesting extension.

- Improving the language planning abilities of LLMs themselves, rather than just focusing on distilling knowledge into smaller models. The current approach uses a post-hoc filtering method to improve LLMs, but does not update the models themselves. Exploring methods like prompt/finetuning for LLMs could be promising. 

- Studying how to better transfer the human language instructions into a form executable by robots. There remain challenges in making the generated scripts actually executable by robotic systems. Bridging this gap is an important direction.

- Mitigating biases and issues with factual correctness in the distilled datasets. While efforts were made to filter inappropriate content, there may still be issues that need to be addressed. Studying bias mitigation and fact-checking methods tailored for LM-generated datasets could help.

- Broadening the diversity of the distilled datasets by incorporating more domains. The current dataset covers everyday activities, but expanding into more specialized domains could enable broader capabilities.

- Comparing distillation from multiple LLMs instead of just InstructGPT. Studying dataset creation from a variety of LLMs could reveal interesting differences in the distilled knowledge.

In summary, the key future directions focus on expanding constrained planning to more complex goals, improving LLMs themselves, studying applicability to real-world execution, addressing potential dataset biases, increasing domain diversity, and exploring multi-LM distillation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper defines the novel problem of constrained language planning, which involves generating goal-oriented scripts that faithfully adhere to specific constraints. The authors propose an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve the constrained language planning abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and InstructGPT. They find that LLMs tend to generate fluent but unfaithful scripts, while their method results in a 26% increase in accuracy by generating multiple scripts and selecting the best. Using this approach, the authors distill a high-quality dataset called CoScript from LLMs, consisting of 55,000 scripts for constrained goals. Experiments show that smaller models like T5, when trained on CoScript, can match or exceed the constrained planning abilities of LLMs. Overall, the work establishes the constrained language planning task, improves LLMs for it, and produces a valuable resource to train specialized models, advancing language planning research toward more complex, real-world goals.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper defines the task of constrained language planning for the first time. This involves generating step-by-step scripts that faithfully adhere to specific constraints imposed on abstract goals. For example, given the abstract goal "make a cake", a specific constrained version could be "make a cake for diabetics". The authors find that large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and InstructGPT are prone to generating fluent but unfaithful scripts for constrained goals. 

To improve LLMs for this task, the authors propose an over-generate-then-filter approach. The core idea is to generate multiple candidate scripts from the LLM, then select the most constraint-faithful one using a filtering model. Based on this approach, the authors use LLMs to generate a novel dataset called CoScript, consisting of 55,000 high-quality scripts for constrained goals. Experiments demonstrate that the over-generate-then-filter method significantly improves LLMs' constrained language planning ability. Further, when trained on CoScript, smaller models like T5 can match or exceed the performance of LLMs for this task. The authors frame their work as "distilling" symbolic knowledge from LLMs into specialized models via the dataset.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on the task of constrained language planning. First, the authors use LLMs like InstructGPT in a human-in-the-loop process to generate a large set of specific goals with constraints based on abstract goals from WikiHow. Then, for each specific goal, they over-generate multiple script plans using InstructGPT, and filter the results to select only high-quality scripts that are semantically coherent and faithful to the constraints. This filtered dataset of goal-script pairs is used to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset called CoScript. Experiments show that the over-generate-then-filter approach significantly improves the constrained language planning ability and constraint faithfulness of LLMs. Furthermore, when specialized smaller models are trained on CoScript, they can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on this task.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:

- The paper focuses on the task of "constrained language planning", which involves generating goal-oriented scripts that contain specific constraints. This is more challenging than just planning for generic, abstract goals like "make a cake".

- Previous work has focused on planning for abstract goals and stereotypical activities, but planning for goals with more specific constraints has been underexplored. The paper aims to advance language planning towards more specific, real-life goals.

- The paper evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and InstructGPT can effectively plan for goals with specific constraints. It finds they tend to plan fluently but unfaithfully to the constraints.

- To improve LLMs for this task, the paper proposes an "over-generate and filter" approach to satisfy constraints better. It also distills a dataset from LLMs to train specialized models, since LLMs are costly. 

- The key questions are: Can LLMs effectively plan for specific goals with constraints? How can we improve them for this? And how can we transfer the ability to smaller models?

In summary, the main problem is constrained language planning for specific goals rather than just abstract ones. The paper aims to evaluate and improve LLMs for this, and distill the capabilities into specialized models. The key questions surround LLM abilities and how to enhance them.
