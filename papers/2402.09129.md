# [Optimal Automated Market Makers: Differentiable Economics and Strong   Duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the optimal design of automated market makers (AMMs) that simultaneously buy and sell multiple goods while maximizing profit. This is challenging as the space of possible AMM mechanisms with multiple goods is complex, potentially allowing bundling across goods or accepting goods "in kind" as payment. Prior work has focused on simpler settings with a single good or goal of information elicitation. This paper aims to understand if an AMM would want to use the full space of mechanisms in a multi-good setting to maximize profit.

Proposed Solution:
1) The authors formulate the AMM design problem mathematically, with objectives that handle adverse selection.
2) They show the problem is dual to an optimal transport problem, allowing dual certificates to prove optimality.
3) Using "differentiable economics", they computationally search for high-performing mechanisms. The learned mechanisms display bundling and in-kind payment behavior.
4) For one learned mechanism, they analytically construct an explicit dual certificate, proving optimality. This optimal mechanism indeed utilizes bundling and in-kind payments.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a framework and dual formulation for proving optimality of multi-good AMMs.
- Employs differentiable economics to guide exploration and develop theory.
- Shows optimal AMMs may exploit mixed bundling and in-kind payments, unlike simpler single-good settings.
- Demonstrates over 10% profit gains compared to independent spreads, highlighting usefulness of the full mechanism space.
- Makes methodological contributions in using differentiable economics to develop theory for new settings.

In summary, the paper develops theory and methods to design optimal multi-good AMMs, shows the full complexity of mechanisms may be needed for profit maximization, and quantifies possible gains compared to simpler designs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a framework to optimize automated market makers trading multiple goods using duality with relaxed constraints and shows such optimal market makers engage in mixed bundling, improving profits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It provides a framework for formally proving the optimality of conjectured automated market maker (AMM) mechanisms that are generated through a differential economics pipeline. Specifically, it shows that the AMM design problem is dual to an optimal transport problem, allowing candidate solutions to be verified.

2. It demonstrates the use of differentiable economics and neural network architectures to search for high-performing AMM mechanisms. The paper shows how these techniques can generate conjectures about the form of optimal mechanisms, even in challenging multi-good settings.

3. It presents a new family of optimal AMM mechanisms for multiple goods under a model of adverse selection. These mechanisms make use of mixed bundling and continuum allocations in certain cases. The paper shows formally that these mechanisms outperform simpler alternatives, demonstrating the value of exploring the full space of possible mechanisms.

4. More broadly, the paper provides a case study illustrating how differentiable economics can guide theoretical investigations and expand our understanding of mechanism design problems. The integration of computer science and economic theory is a methodological contribution.

In summary, the main contributions are in establishing a framework for verifying optimality, using differentiable economics to conjecture optimal mechanisms, presenting specific optimal mechanisms for multiple goods, and showcasing a successful collaboration between computation and theory.

The paper studies the problem of designing optimal automated market makers (AMMs) that can trade multiple goods, with the goal of maximizing the market maker's expected profit under a model of adverse selection. It makes use of concepts like strong duality from optimal transport theory to prove optimality. The paper also demonstrates the use of differential economics and neural network architectures like RochetNet to search for high-performing mechanisms. Some of the key findings are that optimal AMMs may engage in mixed bundling across multiple goods, and that this can lead to higher profits compared to separate spreads on individual goods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes differentiable economics and the RochetNet architecture to search for high-performing market maker mechanisms. How does the flexibility of differentiable economics aid in the search process, compared to more rigid theoretical approaches?

2. The authors show how to construct dual certificates to prove optimality of mechanisms found through differentiable economics. What are the key advantages of this computer-assisted theory approach? How does it compare to a purely manual approach?  

3. The paper finds optimal market maker mechanisms that utilize mixed bundling of goods. What economic intuition explains why mixed bundling can be useful here? How does it help the market maker increase profits?

4. What are the computational limitations of the differentiable economics techniques used here? For example, could the methods scale to settings with many more goods? Are there ways to mitigate potential computational barriers?  

5. The linear adverse selection model used here represents a simple way to capture asymmetric information. How might the results change under alternate models of information asymmetry between traders and market makers?

6. The optimal transport duality theory is extended here to allow different constraints on the primal and dual problems. What is the economic motivation behind allowing this relaxation? How does it impact designing the dual certificates?

7. The paper shows optimal mechanisms for uniform and beta distributions. How might the structure of optimal mechanisms change for other common valuation distributions? What factors determine sensitivity to the distribution?  

8. What practical guidance do the results provide for the design of combinatorial and multi-good automated market makers? What challenges remain in real-world deployment?

9. The conjectured 3-good optimal mechanism has an intricate geometry. What economic factors drive this level of complexity? How might complexity scale as more goods are added?

10. The techniques here could be used for optimizing other mechanism design problems. What alternate settings seem amenable to this computer-assisted theory approach? Where might human intuition still clearly outperform automated search?
