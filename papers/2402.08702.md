# [PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST): Integrating Human   Feedback and Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08702)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) for automatically optimizing prompts for large language models (LLMs) on complex, multi-step agent tasks. 

The key problem is that optimizing prompts for LLMs on multi-step tasks is very challenging due to the long prompt length, individual task constraints and rules, and variance in human preferences about task execution. Existing methods that use LLMs to analyze errors and suggest prompt edits struggle with these more complex prompts and environments. Humans are better at providing useful feedback but manually designing optimal prompts is extremely difficult.

To address this, PROMST integrates intuitive feedback rules designed by humans along with a learned score prediction model to efficiently guide the prompt optimization process. The framework follows a genetic algorithm where an LLM generates new candidate prompts based on the best current prompts and associated human feedback. A fine-tuned score model predicts the quality of new candidates to focus the search.

Experiments across 8 multi-step environments demonstrate that PROMST significantly outperforms previous prompt optimization techniques, improving performance by over 25% on average. The learned score model is shown to improve search efficiency and incorporating human feedback rules enables better prompt refinement compared to fully automated analysis.

Additionally, the paper demonstrates that modifying the score function for a task can help align the optimized prompts to individual human preferences, balancing various factors like efficiency vs. safety.

The key contributions are: (1) The first framework to tackle optimizing prompts on complex, multi-step LLM-based agent tasks. (2) Integrating human feedback and learned score models to outperform previous methods. (3) Modifying score functions to align prompts with human preferences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces PROMST, a new framework for optimizing prompts in complex, multi-step agent tasks by integrating human-designed feedback rules and a learned score prediction model to efficiently guide a language model through the vast prompt search space.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of PROMST, a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework for multi-step agent tasks that integrates human-designed feedback rules to automatically generate feedback for an LLM to refine prompts. PROMST also uses a learned heuristic function to predict prompt performance and efficiently select good candidates during the prompt search process. The paper shows that PROMST significantly outperforms baseline methods for prompt optimization on a suite of 8 multi-step tasks, achieving an average 28% relative improvement. The release of datasets, code, and optimized prompts for these 8 environments is also presented as a potential benchmark for future research on prompt optimization for multi-step tasks.

So in summary, the main contribution is a new automated prompt optimization method designed specifically for complex, multi-step agent tasks that integrates both human feedback rules and learned models to efficiently search the space of prompts.
