# [NERV++: An Enhanced Implicit Neural Video Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18305)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural video compression methods based on autoencoders have high complexity which limits adoption. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer promise for video compression due to compactness and expressiveness but current INR-based methods have limited rate-distortion performance and struggle to capture high-frequency details.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces NeRV++, an enhanced implicit neural video representation to improve compression efficiency. 

- The key innovation is the NeRV++ decoder block featuring:
   - Separable conv residual block (SCRB) sandwiching traditional upsampling block (UB)
   - Bilinear interpolation skip connection for feature refinement

- Additional modifications include positional encoding and optimization as a rate-distortion problem with pruning and quantization.

Main Contributions:

- Novel compact convolutional architecture for INRs that enhances representation capacity beyond current non-hybrid INR video codecs

- Introduction of NeRV++ decoder block with SCRB and bilinear interpolation to simplify yet effectively improve over NeRV

- Extensive experiments on UVG, MCL-JVC and Bunny datasets showing NeRV++ achieves state-of-the-art for non-hybrid INRs for video compression. Competitive rate-distortion performance to autoencoder methods.

- Analysis of model complexity highlights reduced complexity compared to NeRV baseline.

In summary, the paper makes notable advances in improving the efficiency of INR-based video compression to make them more viable alternatives to autoencoder solutions. The proposed NeRV++ architecture and decoder block enhance representation capabilities and rate-distortion performance on key benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents NeRV++, an enhanced implicit neural video representation that incorporates separable convolution residual blocks sandwiching upsampling blocks along with a bilinear interpolation skip connection, achieving state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance among non-hybrid neural video codecs on UVG, MCL-JVC, and Bunny datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The development of a novel compact convolutional architecture for neural video representation that surpasses the representation capacity of state-of-the-art non-hybrid implicit neural representation (INR)-based video codecs. 

2. The design of the NeRV++ decoder block as a simpler yet effective enhancement over the original NeRV decoder architecture. The key aspects are a separable conv2d residual block (SCRB) that sandwiches the upsampling block (UB), and a bilinear interpolation skip layer for improved feature representation.

3. Extensive experiments on key benchmark datasets for video compression, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed NeRV++ decoder architecture and establishing new state-of-the-art results for non-hybrid implicit neural video representation. The results show significant bitrate savings and enhanced rate-distortion performance compared to previous INR-based video codecs.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and evaluation of an enhanced implicit neural video representation method called NeRV++ that achieves improved compression efficiency through architectural innovations in the decoder network.
