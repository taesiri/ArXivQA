# Investigating Prompting Techniques for Zero- and Few-Shot Visual
  Question Answering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:What prompting techniques are effective for improving zero-shot and few-shot visual question answering (VQA) performance in large vision-language models like BLIP2?The key aspects investigated are:- The impact of different question templates on steering the model's answer generation.- The role of incorporating text-only few-shot QA examples as additional context. - The benefits of using image captions as extra visual cues when combined with few-shot examples.- The effectiveness of prompting chain-of-thought reasoning to generate step-by-step rationales.The overarching goal seems to be exploring simple but effective prompting strategies to better utilize large pre-trained models like BLIP2 for VQA, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The paper examines the above techniques on challenging VQA datasets to provide insights into advancing zero- and few-shot VQA.In summary, the central research question focuses on investigating prompting methods to improve the zero-shot and few-shot VQA capabilities of models like BLIP2. The key techniques explored are question templates, few-shot examples, image captions, and chain-of-thought reasoning prompts.
