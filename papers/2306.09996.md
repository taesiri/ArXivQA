# Investigating Prompting Techniques for Zero- and Few-Shot Visual   Question Answering

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:What prompting techniques are effective for improving zero-shot and few-shot visual question answering (VQA) performance in large vision-language models like BLIP2?The key aspects investigated are:- The impact of different question templates on steering the model's answer generation.- The role of incorporating text-only few-shot QA examples as additional context. - The benefits of using image captions as extra visual cues when combined with few-shot examples.- The effectiveness of prompting chain-of-thought reasoning to generate step-by-step rationales.The overarching goal seems to be exploring simple but effective prompting strategies to better utilize large pre-trained models like BLIP2 for VQA, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The paper examines the above techniques on challenging VQA datasets to provide insights into advancing zero- and few-shot VQA.In summary, the central research question focuses on investigating prompting methods to improve the zero-shot and few-shot VQA capabilities of models like BLIP2. The key techniques explored are question templates, few-shot examples, image captions, and chain-of-thought reasoning prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. An investigation of various prompting techniques for improving zero-shot and few-shot visual question answering (VQA) performance of the BLIP2 model, without any task-specific fine-tuning. 2. An exploration of the effectiveness of different question templates, text-only few-shot examples, image captions as additional context, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for rationalization.3. An evaluation of these prompting techniques on challenging VQA datasets that require compositional reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning, where BLIP2 struggles in zero-shot settings.4. Key findings showing the instruction-tuned FLAN-T5 language model has moderate sensitivity to question templates, while OPT exhibits higher sensitivity. Few-shot examples hurt VQA performance unless paired with caption or CoT examples. Captions consistently improve VQA accuracy when combined with few-shot QA pairs. However, CoT reasoning decreases VQA accuracy.5. The insights provided on how to better utilize large pre-trained vision-language models like BLIP2 for zero- and few-shot VQA via prompting strategies.In summary, the main contribution appears to be a comprehensive investigation and novel findings on effective prompting techniques to improve zero- and few-shot VQA performance for models like BLIP2, without expensive task-specific fine-tuning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper investigates various prompting techniques such as question templates, few-shot examples, image captions, and chain-of-thought reasoning to improve the zero-shot visual question answering performance of the BLIP2 model on complex VQA datasets; it finds that careful prompt design, especially using image captions along with few-shot examples, can significantly enhance BLIP2's VQA accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few points comparing this paper to other research in visual question answering:- This paper focuses specifically on investigating the effectiveness of different prompting techniques like question templates, few-shot examples, captions, and chain-of-thought reasoning for the BLIP2 model. Other VQA papers often propose new model architectures rather than focusing only on prompting strategies.- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of prompting techniques across multiple challenging VQA datasets like OKVQA, AOKVQA, and GQA that require knowledge-based and compositional reasoning. Many other papers focus evaluation on more general VQA datasets like VQAv2.- The paper explores zero- and few-shot transfer of BLIP2 to VQA tasks via prompting. Some other works like Flamingo and MAPL also utilize few-shot learning but require special pre-training. - For incorporating rationales, this paper examines chain-of-thought prompting which has shown success in NLP. However, the results show limitations of this technique for improving BLIP2's VQA performance, unlike for language models.- Compared to some other prompting methods that employ large models like GPT-3 or convert questions to programs executed on multiple models, this work focuses specifically on maximizing BLIP2's capabilities using text prompts only.- The insights on effective prompting strategies could inform future research on adapting large VLMs for VQA in low-data regimes, without requiring extensive fine-tuning. However, the findings may be most applicable to BLIP2 and not generalize fully to other models.In summary, this paper provides targeted analysis of prompting techniques for boosting BLIP2's VQA abilities on complex reasoning tasks, contrasting with many works that propose new models or evaluate on standard VQA benchmarks. The insights could guide future work on prompting large VLMs for VQA.
