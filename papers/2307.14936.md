# [PanGu-Coder2: Boosting Large Language Models for Code with Ranking   Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14936)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we effectively boost the code generation performance of pre-trained large language models for code (Code LLMs) using ranking responses to align test & teacher feedback?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a novel framework called RRTF (Rank Responses to align Test & Teacher Feedback) to improve Code LLMs. 

- RRTF combines instruction tuning, evolutional prompt generation, and reinforcement learning ideas to rank model responses using test signals and teacher preferences as feedback.

- The goal is to boost Code LLMs like improving their instruction following and code writing capabilities for better code generation.

- As a proof of concept, the paper shows RRTF can improve StarCoder 15B by around 30% absolutely on HumanEval benchmark.

So in summary, the core research question is how to leverage ranking responses as a form of feedback to improve pre-trained Code LLMs for better code generation performance. The RRTF framework is proposed as a way to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework called RRTF (Rank Responses to align Test&Teacher Feedback) to boost the code generation performance of pre-trained large language models for code (Code LLMs). 

The key ideas of RRTF are:

- Sample responses to programming prompts from the student model and teacher models. 

- Rank the responses by executing them and comparing results to tests, as well as using heuristic preferences (preferring teacher outputs).

- Train the student model using the ranked responses as targets, aligning it with the better-performing teacher outputs.

The authors apply RRTF to the 15B parameter StarCoder model and present Pangu-Coder2 (PanGu-Coder2), which achieves state-of-the-art results on code generation benchmarks like HumanEval, surpassing previous Code LLMs.

Overall, the main contribution is proposing RRTF as an effective and simple way to improve Code LLMs using ranking-based training, without needing complex reinforcement learning algorithms. The results demonstrate its ability to boost performance on code generation tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of code generation with large language models:

Positive aspects:

- The proposed RRTF framework is novel and shows promising results. Combining ranking-based reinforcement learning with test feedback is an interesting idea that seems to effectively improve code generation capabilities.

- The model architecture leverages recent advances like FlashAttention to scale up to 15B parameters with long context length, enabling stronger performance.

- The training data creation process using Evol-Instruct is smart, allowing the collection of a large customized dataset without manual effort.

- The model achieves new SOTA results on major benchmarks like HumanEval, CoderEval and LeetCode, demonstrating broad improvements.

- The analysis provides insights into training behavior and model comparisons. The case studies are especially informative.

Limitations:

- The training data is not publicly released, so the results cannot be easily reproduced. More details on the dataset construction would be helpful.

- The proposed approach still lags behind commercial models like GPT-4. There is room for improvement to close this gap.

- It focuses only on Python code generation, while some recent works tackle multiple languages.

- The reinforcement learning aspect is relatively simple compared to prior techniques like PPO or actor-critic methods.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel training framework that pushes forward the state-of-the-art in open-source code generation models. The results are impressive but reproduceability is limited without the training data. There are still opportunities to build on this approach to match proprietary models and expand beyond Python. But it represents an advance for the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Conduct an in-depth study on the interesting result that model quantization (e.g. with CTranslate2) slightly improves the performance on the HumanEval benchmark. The authors hypothesize this may be due to the inherent robustness of the Pangu-Coder model, but further analysis is needed.

- Explore the combination of the proposed RRTF framework with instruction tuning techniques to further boost the performance of code LLMs. The authors mention instruction tuning as a promising direction that could complement RRTF.

- Improve handling of more complex programming requirements that currently challenge state-of-the-art code LLMs. The case study shows examples where all models fail likely due to problem intricacy. Advancing code understanding abilities could help. 

- Incorporate step-by-step commented code data during training, as the case study shows the instruction-tuned WizardCoder model benefits from this. Could be promising for RRTF as well.

- Scale up model size and training data to continue pushing state-of-the-art performance. The authors show RRTF efficiently trains large models, so larger scale exploration could further boost capabilities.

- Test RRTF application to other code LLMs besides the proof-of-concept on StarCoder. The framework is model-agnostic, so assessing broad applicability could be valuable.

- Analyze model performance on a wider range of code generation benchmarks to complement HumanEval, CoderEval, LeetCode. Additional testbeds could reveal strengths/weaknesses.

- Deploy optimized production models from RRTF and study real-world usage, as the inference optimization experiments lay groundwork for applied settings.

In summary, directions largely focus on model scaling, training enhancements, benchmarking, and real-world deployment studies to build on the RRTF framework introduced in this paper.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called RRTF (Rank Responses to align Test & Teacher Feedback) to boost the performance of pre-trained code generation models. The key idea is to sample responses to programming prompts from both the student model being trained and teacher models, then rank these responses by running tests and using heuristics. The ranked responses are used to train the student model with a loss function that aligns its probabilities with the rankings. 

The authors apply RRTF to the 15B parameter StarCoder model. The resulting model, called Pangu-Coder2, achieves state-of-the-art results on code generation benchmarks including HumanEval (62.2% pass@1), CoderEval (38.26% pass@1) and LeetCode (32/30/10 easy/medium/hard solved). This demonstrates the effectiveness of RRTF for improving code generation models. The authors also analyze the training process and case studies to provide insights. Overall, this work presents a simple yet powerful approach to boosting pre-trained code generation models using ranking feedback.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called RRTF (Rank Responses to align Test & Teacher Feedback) to improve code generation performance of pre-trained large language models for code (Code LLMs). RRTF has three main steps: (1) Sampling: Generate response candidates using the Code LLM with prompts from an evolved dataset. (2) Ranking: Rank the responses by executing tests and using heuristic preferences, assigning higher scores to outputs from teacher models. (3) Training: Train the Code LLM on the ranked prompt-response pairs to align it with better responses based on the test and teacher feedback. Compared to prior reinforcement learning methods, RRTF provides a simpler and more efficient way to leverage test signals and teacher preferences to boost Code LLMs. The paper shows this framework significantly improves the StarCoder 15B model, achieving new state-of-the-art results on HumanEval, CoderEval and LeetCode benchmarks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to effectively boost the code generation capabilities of large language models for code (Code LLMs). 

Specifically, the paper points out limitations in prior approaches using reinforcement learning to improve Code LLMs, such as relying heavily on quality of unit tests, complexity of implementing RL algorithms like PPO, and difficulty scaling RL to large models. 

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new framework called RRTF (Rank Responses to align Test & Teacher Feedback) to improve Code LLMs. The key ideas seem to be:

- Using ranking of model responses rather than absolute rewards to provide training signal. This is inspired by prior work on aligning LLMs through human feedback.

- Leveraging both test signals (e.g. from running code) and teacher signals (outputs from other models or experts) jointly to rank responses. 

- A 3-step training process of sampling, ranking, and training that seems simpler and more efficient than prior RL or PPO approaches.

So in summary, the main question appears to be how to effectively boost Code LLMs in a data-efficient and scalable way, which their RRTF framework aims to address. The paper seems focused on introducing and evaluating this method.
