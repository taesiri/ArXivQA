# [Large Language Models are Strong Zero-Shot Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14233)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main research question is: How can large language models (LLMs) be effectively leveraged for large-scale information retrieval in a zero-shot setting, without requiring any labeled training data?More specifically, the authors are investigating whether LLMs can serve as strong zero-shot retrievers on their own, without needing to be combined with other specialized retrieval models that require training. Their proposed method, LameR, uses an LLM to augment queries with potential answers, which are then fed into a simple non-parametric retriever like BM25. The central hypothesis appears to be that by prompting the LLM with retrieved candidate passages for a given query, the LLM can generate higher quality query augmentations that lead to improved retrieval performance compared to prior zero-shot LLM retrieval techniques. The authors posit that exposing the LLM to in-domain candidates helps steer its answer generation, even when the candidates are not correct.In summary, the main research question is whether LLMs can effectively act as standalone zero-shot retrievers, without needing to be combined with other trained retrieval models. The hypothesis is that prompting the LLM with retrieved candidates can boost its query augmentation ability in this zero-shot setting. The authors aim to demonstrate the viability of this approach across several benchmark retrieval datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here is a summary of the key contributions of the paper:- The paper proposes a new method called LameR (Large language model as Retriever) for large-scale document retrieval in zero-shot settings. The key idea is to leverage a large language model (LLM) to generate query augmentations, without needing any labeled training data.- LameR uses the LLM in a novel prompt format - it provides the LLM with top retrieved candidates for the query as context when generating the query augmentation. This helps the LLM generate more precise and in-domain augmentations compared to just prompting the LLM with the query. - Instead of using a weak self-supervised neural retriever, LameR opts for a simple non-parametric term-based retriever like BM25. This allows the literal query augmentations to directly interact with the inverted index, avoiding the performance bottleneck caused by the neural retriever.- Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show LameR outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot retrievers by a large margin. It also exceeds performance of systems using full supervision and even some with few-shot examples.- Overall, the key contribution is a simple yet effective LLM-based zero-shot retrieval system that circumvents issues like weak neural retrievers and out-of-domain augmentations faced by prior work. The power of large LM prompts combined with BM25 retrieval leads to new state-of-the-art performance.In summary, the main contribution is the novel LameR framework for zero-shot large-scale retrieval using an LLM for candidate-prompted query augmentation and BM25 for fast and effective retrieval.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:- The paper proposes a novel method for leveraging large language models for zero-shot information retrieval. This is an active area of research, with other recent works like HyDE and Contriever exploring similar ideas. However, this paper's approach of incorporating retrieved in-domain candidates into the prompt is unique. - Most prior work has combined large language models with learned dense retrievers. A key difference in this paper is the use of a non-parametric lexicon-based retriever like BM25 instead, which allows the model to avoid bottlenecks imposed by the learned retriever.- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets compared to other zero-shot methods. The gains are especially notable on web search datasets like DL19/DL20. This shows the proposed techniques are particularly promising for query-document retrieval.- An interesting finding is that stronger language models like GPT-4 can further boost performance when incorporated into the framework. This suggests there is headroom for larger language models to continue improving on these zero-shot retrieval tasks.- The paper provides useful ablation studies and analysis around the number of retrieved candidates and answers generated. These experiments help validate design decisions like using 10 candidates and 5 answers.- There is limited comparison to supervised approaches. While results surpass some supervised baselines, examining how the approach fares against SOTA supervised retrievers would add helpful context.Overall, the paper makes excellent progress on zero-shot retrieval by creatively combining language models with traditional non-parametric methods. The performance is very competitive, demonstrating language models can effectively serve as zero-shot retrievers given the right framework. More analysis on efficiency vs supervised methods could further highlight benefits. But the core ideas appear novel and well-motivated compared to related works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques to improve in-context learning performance. The authors mention varying the wording, structure, and examples in prompts as an important area for future work.- Exploring different sampling strategies when generating demonstrations from large corpora, to provide more useful examples for in-context learning. The paper suggests importance sampling and active learning methods as possibilities.- Combining retrieved demonstrations with demonstrations synthesized by models to get the benefits of both high relevance and high coverage. - Using demonstrations for purposes beyond specifying tasks/domains, such as directly providing training signal and supervision. The authors propose viewing demonstrations as "contrastive explanations" to guide model learning.- Studying the role of false demonstrations and how models handle invalid or low-quality examples provided in context. More robustness to noisy demonstrations could improve real-world application.- Scaling up in-context learning with techniques like distillation and synthetic data augmentation to handle longer prompts and more demonstrations. This could expand the applicability of the approach.- Theorizing the mechanisms behind in-context learning and exactly how models use provided demonstrations. A better understanding could inform the development of more powerful techniques.In general, the paper emphasizes the need for more research on how to effectively harness large corpora to find or generate useful demonstrations that make in-context learning succeed. This demonstration retrieval and construction process seems critical to progress.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method called LameR for large-scale text retrieval in zero-shot settings using only a large language model (LLM) and a simple non-parametric retriever like BM25, without needing any neural retrieval models. LameR works by augmenting the query text with potential answers generated by prompting the LLM with the query text plus its top retrieved candidates from the target collection. This helps the LLM generate more accurate in-domain answers by imitating or summarizing the candidates. LameR uses BM25 rather than a neural retriever to avoid the performance bottleneck of weak self-supervised neural retrievers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show LameR outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval methods and even some supervised retrieval models. The key ideas are using candidate passages to help the LLM generate better query augmentations, and using BM25 rather than neural retrieval to avoid bottlenecking the LLM's outputs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a simple yet effective method for large-scale retrieval in zero-shot scenarios called LameR (Large language model as Retriever). LameR uses only a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 and a basic BM25 algorithm for retrieval, without requiring any trained neural retrieval models. During query augmentation, LameR prompts the LLM with the query along with its top retrieved candidate passages from the target collection. This allows the LLM to generate more precise and in-domain answers by imitating or summarizing the candidates, even if they are wrong. LameR uses BM25 for efficient and transparent retrieval over the literal LLM augmentations, avoiding performance bottlenecks caused by weak neural retrievers. Experiments on benchmark datasets show LameR achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval, outperforming methods like HyDE and even some supervised models. Its simplicity, avoidance of fragile self-supervised retrievers, and leveraging of LLMs' knowledge make LameR an effective paradigm for large-scale retrieval.The key innovation of LameR is prompting the LLM with retrieved candidates to make it aware of query intent and domain patterns. This results in better query augmentation than just prompting with the query. LameR also uses BM25 instead of neural retrievers to directly leverage the literal LLM text, preventing performance bottlenecks. Thorough experiments verify LameR's effectiveness, outperforming zero-shot and some supervised methods. Its simple yet powerful approach demonstrates LLMs can serve as strong retrievers themselves, avoiding complex training or pipelines. LameR provides a new direction for large-scale retrieval by solely exploiting LLMs' knowledge.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a simple yet effective method for large-scale retrieval in zero-shot scenarios called LameR (Large language model as Retriever). LameR uses a large language model (LLM) and a basic BM25 algorithm without relying on any other learnable retrieval models. When generating answers from the LLM to augment a query, LameR first retrieves top candidate passages for the query using BM25. These candidates are injected into the prompt for the LLM, which helps the LLM generate more precise in-domain answers by providing examples of potential answering passages and making the LLM aware of patterns/knowledge from the target collection. Multiple answers are generated to augment the original query, which is then fed directly into BM25 retrieval over the full collection. By using a non-parametric lexicon-based retriever like BM25, LameR avoids performance bottlenecks caused by weak neural retrievers and takes the LLM outputs transparently without compressed embeddings. Experiments show LameR achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval, outperforming methods like HyDE that use LLM augmentation without retrieved candidates.
