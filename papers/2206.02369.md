# [Learning to Break the Loop: Analyzing and Mitigating Repetitions for   Neural Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02369)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Why do neural language models with maximization-based decoding algorithms (e.g. greedy search) tend to get stuck generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, which is counter to the patterns found in human text corpora?

The authors investigate this through quantitative analysis of how the probabilities of repetitive tokens relate to the number of previous repetitions in the context. Their key findings are:

1) Models tend to increase the probability of repeating the previous sentence, even with just one repetition in the context. 

2) There is a "self-reinforcement effect" where probability of repetition increases monotonically as the number of historical repetitions grows.

3) Sentences with higher initial probabilities tend to have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. 

Based on these analyses, the authors propose that models get stuck in repetitive loops due to the tendency to repeat previous high-probability sentences combined with the self-reinforcement effect. They then develop a training method called DITTO to mitigate repetition by penalizing repetition probabilities on artificially constructed repetitive data.

So in summary, the central research question is understanding the underlying factors behind models' tendency for repetitive text generation, with the goal of developing methods to reduce repetition. The hypothesis is that analyzing and mitigating the self-reinforcement effect of repetitions will improve text generation quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors conducted quantitative analyses to investigate the underlying reasons why neural language models with maximization-based decoding (e.g. greedy search) tend to generate repetitive text, especially getting stuck in consecutive sentence-level repetitions. 

Their analyses reveal three key findings:

- Models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence even with just one repetition in context. 

- Repetition demonstrates a self-reinforcement effect - the probability of repetition increases monotonically as the number of historical repetitions grows.

- Sentences with higher initial probabilities tend to have a stronger self-reinforcement effect.

2. Motivated by the analysis, the authors propose a simple and effective training method called DITTO. It constructs pseudo repetitive data by repeating sentences from the training set, and teaches the model to learn to penalize the probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from the pseudo data.

3. Extensive experiments show DITTO not only reduces repetition issues without hurting perplexity, but also improves text generation quality measured by both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The method demonstrates effectiveness on both open-ended generation (Wikitext-103) and summarization (CNN/DailyMail).

In summary, the key contribution is conducting in-depth quantitative analyses to uncover the root cause of text repetition issue, and proposing an effective training method to mitigate repetition and improve generation quality. The analyses and solutions provide useful insights on improving neural text generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new training method called DITTO that analyzes the root causes of repetitive text generation in neural language models and teaches the model to decay repetition probabilities by constructing pseudo repetitive data, leading to improved text generation quality.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of mitigating repetition for neural text generation:

- The paper provides an in-depth quantitative analysis of the tendency for neural language models to repeat sentences during text generation. Prior work had observed this issue, but this paper offers more detailed experiments and metrics to characterize the "self-reinforcement effect" of repetitions. 

- The proposed method DITTO takes a simple training-based approach to teach the model to penalize repetitive sentences, rather than relying solely on modified decoding methods like previous work. The results demonstrate DITTO's effectiveness at reducing repetition without sacrificing perplexity or generation quality.

- The analysis of how the probability of repetition increases for sentences based on their initial likelihood provides novel insights. Prior theoretical analysis had approximated language models as Markov models, but this paper shows the effect of longer-range dependencies. 

- The experiments are rigorous, testing DITTO over an open-ended generation task and a summarization task. Ablations also test different loss functions and training setups. The scale of models and datasets matches the state-of-the-art.

- Compared to prior training-based approaches like unlikelihood training and straight-to-generator, DITTO seems to balance repetition reduction while maintaining relevance and coherence. The human evaluation results are especially informative for assessing overall generation quality.

In summary, this paper makes valuable contributions in deeply analyzing the repetition problem and proposing an effective training-based solution. The insights into model behavior are novel, and the approach balances tradeoffs well. The experiments are thorough and support the claims.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:

- Further analyzing the underlying reasons for why language models prefer repetitions, beyond just the quantitative analyses done in this work. The authors mention investigating the model embeddings, neural network architecture, and intrinsic characteristics of language that may lead to the repetition phenomenon.

- Expanding the analyses and proposed methods to other types of neural networks beyond just Transformers, to see if similar issues exist and can be mitigated. 

- Applying the proposed pseudo-repetition penalization method to other text generation tasks beyond summarization and open-ended generation. The authors suggest it may be useful for dialogue, translation, and other goals.

- Studying other ways to construct the pseudo-repetitive training data, besides just repeating sentences. The paper tried repeating random pairs of sentences, but other strategies could be explored as well.

- Exploring different loss functions or training objectives to penalize repetition, compared to the exponential decay loss used in this work. There may be other effective ways to teach the model to avoid unnecessary repetition.

- Analyzing the optimal hyperparameters like the repetition penalization factor λ for different models, datasets, and tasks. More analysis is needed to determine the best values.

- Extending the work to investigate and mitigate repetition issues in very large pretrained models like GPT-3, which also exhibit repetition problems.

So in summary, the main future directions are deeper analysis into the root causes of repetition, applying the method to other models and tasks, exploring alternative training strategies, and better understanding the hyperparameters. There are still many open questions left to explore in this problem area.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the issue of consecutive sentence-level repetitions in neural text generation models like GPT-2 and BART when using greedy decoding. The authors find through quantitative experiments that models have a preference for repeating previous sentences and that repetitions exhibit a self-reinforcement effect where the probability of repeating a sentence increases the more times it has already been repeated. To mitigate this issue, the authors propose a training method called DITTO where models learn to penalize the probabilities of sentence repetitions on pseudo-repetitive data. Experiments on open-ended text generation and summarization tasks show DITTO reduces repetitions without sacrificing perplexity and achieves better generation quality compared to baselines. The method is simple, effective, and compatible with existing stochastic decoding strategies.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the issue of repetitive text generation in neural language models. The authors find that models tend to get stuck in repetitive sentence-level loops when generating text, which is very different from human-written text. Through quantitative experiments, they show that language models have a preference for repeating previous sentences, and that repetition has a self-reinforcing effect - the more times a sentence is repeated, the higher the probability the model will continue generating that sentence. This effect is stronger for sentences with higher initial probabilities. 

Based on these findings, the authors propose a training method called DITTO to reduce repetitive generations. It constructs pseudo-repetitive data by repeating sentences, and trains the model to exponentially decay the repetition probability as the number of repetitions grows. Experiments on open-ended text generation and summarization tasks show DITTO reduces repetitions without hurting perplexity or accuracy. It also improves the quality of generated text as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation. Overall, the analyses provide insights into why models repeat text, and DITTO offers a simple but effective approach to produce more diverse, human-like generations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called Pseudo-repetition Penalization (DITTO) to mitigate repetition issues in text generation models. The key points are:

- The authors first analyze the root cause of repetition by quantitatively studying the relationship between repetition probability and number of historical repetitions. They find models have a tendency to repeat sentences and a self-reinforcement effect where repetition probability increases with more historical repetitions. 

- To overcome this, DITTO constructs pseudo-repetitive data by repeating sentences from the training set. It then teaches the model to exponentially decay the repetition probability as the number of repetitions grows, using a repetition penalization loss. 

- Experiments on open-ended generation and summarization tasks show DITTO reduces repetition effectively without hurting perplexity or accuracy. It also improves generation quality, achieving higher MAUVE scores and better human evaluation than baselines. The method is simple, generalizable across tasks, and compatible with stochastic decoding strategies.
