# [Image Synthesis-based Late Stage Cancer Augmentation and Semi-Supervised   Segmentation for MRI Rectal Cancer Staging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04779)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes two methods - semi-supervised learning and late stage cancer data augmentation through image synthesis - to address two key challenges in developing AI systems for rectal cancer segmentation and T-staging from MR images: lack of large-scale, high-quality labelled training datasets, and scarcity of advanced stage cancer cases. A novel T-stage loss function is introduced to enable semi-supervised training from both per-pixel labels and per-image T-stage labels. Additionally, an image synthesis method is used to generate realistic advanced cancer MR images by deforming cancer labels based on simulations of cancer progression. Experiments combining both methods show improved segmentation performance on cancer regions, especially invaded areas, and the highest T-stage classification accuracy with sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 0.80. The proposed methods help address data constraints and improve AI accuracy for rectal cancer staging to support clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.
