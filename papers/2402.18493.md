# [Sunshine to Rainstorm: Cross-Weather Knowledge Distillation for Robust   3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 3D object detection performance degrades significantly under rainy weather conditions due to dense noise points and missing points in the LiDAR point clouds. Existing methods do not address this robustness issue effectively.  

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes two methods - Dense Rain Enhancement Training Data Augmentation (DRET-Aug) and Student-Teacher Rainy Knowledge Distillation (SRKD) to improve the robustness of 3D detectors. 

DRET-Aug augments the clear weather training data by simulating rainy conditions like adding virtual noise points and missing points. This exposes the model to rainy variations during training.

SRKD employs knowledge distillation where a teacher model trained on rainy data teaches a student model trained on clear data to improve generalization. The consistency losses between teacher and student outputs supervise the student to learn rain-robust features.

Main Contributions:
1) Identify and analyze the dense noise and missing points phenomena as the main factors affecting 3D detection in rain.

2) Propose DRET-Aug to simulate rainy conditions and augment clear weather training data.

3) Design a cross-weather student-teacher framework SRKD which transfers knowledge from rainy teacher to clear student for improving rain robustness.

4) Achieve SOTA results on real rainy test set WOD-DA across multiple 3D detectors like Voxel-RCNN, PV-RCNN++ and DSVT. E.g. improve PV-RCNN++ mAP by 4.7%.

5) Demonstrate generalizability of the approach across single stage and two stage detectors.

In summary, the paper effectively addresses the problem of performance degradation of 3D detectors in rain using data augmentation and knowledge distillation techniques. The proposed DRET-Aug and SRKD achieve significant and consistent improvements across detectors.
