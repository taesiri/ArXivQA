# [Constrained Bayesian Optimization Under Partial Observations: Balanced   Improvements and Provable Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03212)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) method called CBOB for efficiently solving partially observable constrained optimization problems (POCOPs). The method has two main components: 1) An improved acquisition function design called EICB that balances exploitation and exploration by incorporating a dynamic version of the probability of feasibility (DPOF). EICB is shown theoretically to converge to the global optimum. 2) A heterogeneity likelihood Gaussian process (HLGP) surrogate model that fully exploits both feasible and infeasible observations to more accurately represent constraints. Experiments on synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate CBOB's competitiveness against state-of-the-art CBO methods. The results show it obtains better solutions than methods like EIC, MESC, and TSC. The balanced exploration of EICB prevents over-exploitation of local feasible regions which improves optimization efficiency. Additionally, modeling constraints with HLGP outperforms classifier-based approaches like GPC. In summary, the proposed CBOB framework with EICB acquisition function and HLGP modeling is an efficient and provably convergent method for solving computationally expensive POCOPs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a constrained Bayesian optimization method with balanced exploration and principled handling of partial observations for efficient optimization of expensive black-box problems with unknown constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It presents an improved acquisition function design called EICB (EI with Constraints and Balance) that introduces more balanced exploration during optimization to mitigate over-exploitation of known feasible regions. It provides a theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of this design. 

2. It proposes a heterogeneous likelihood Gaussian process (HLGP) model to more accurately represent partially observable constraints, leading to better exploitation of available observations compared to traditional classification-based models. It uses expectation propagation for efficient Gaussian approximation of the HLGP.

3. It empirically evaluates the proposed methods on both synthetic and real-world constrained optimization problems with partial observations. The results demonstrate that the proposed CBOB method performs competitively compared to other state-of-the-art constrained Bayesian optimization algorithms.

In summary, the key innovations are around introducing more balanced exploration into the acquisition function design while also better modeling partially observable constraints, leading to overall improvements in solving the considered class of partially observable constrained optimization problems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new acquisition function called EICB that incorporates dynamic POF (DPOF). How does DPOF differ from traditional POF and why is this proposed? What are the theoretical guarantees provided for EICB?

2. The paper introduces the concept of an exploration function ρ(x) for facilitating more balanced exploration in CBO. What properties must ρ(x) satisfy? Why is more balanced exploration useful here?

3. The proposed exploration function in Eq. 9 aims to identify potential constraint boundaries. Explain the intuition behind this design and why it can encourage greater exploration compared to simply targeting the most uncertain regions.

4. The paper also proposes an alternative more aggressive exploration function based on reducing uncertainty of global feasible regions. Explain how this function is derived and what adaptation law is used for one of its parameters. What are its limitations?  

5. Explain the concept of heterogeneous likelihood Gaussian processes and how they are used to model constraints in this paper. What are the advantages of this approach over traditional classification-based models like GPC?

6. Expectation propagation is used for inference in the HLGP models. Briefly explain the EP algorithm, the site parameters used, and the update laws that are applied. Why is EP preferred here over directly maximizing the marginal likelihood?

7. One of the benefits claimed is better exploitation of mixed data observations. Elaborate on how both the DPOF technique and HLGP models allow improved use of all available data compared to prior methods.

8. How exactly does the proposed CBOB framework mitigate risks of over-exploitation and over-confidence during optimization of POCOPs? Substantiate your explanation.

9. The empirical results show lower ratios of feasible evaluations for CBOB. Analyze if and why this can be indicative of enhanced exploration. Does greater exploration directly translate to optimization efficiency?

10. The paper focuses on improving EI-based methods. Can the proposed DPOF technique be integrated with other acquisition functions? What theoretical and empirical analyses would be needed to study convergence guarantees?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of partially observable constrained optimization problems (POCOPs). In POCOPs, evaluating an infeasible solution provides little information about the objective and constraints. Existing constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) methods can become inefficient for POCOPs due to two main issues:

1) Over-exploitation of known feasible regions, leading to over-confidence in modeling and acquisition.

2) Conventional surrogate models like Gaussian process classifiers lack capability to fully exploit the valid mixed data with partial observations. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new CBO framework called CBOB to efficiently solve POCOPs. The key ideas are:

1) Design an improved acquisition function called EICB that introduces balanced exploration using a dynamic version of probability of feasibility (DPOF). DPOF assigns more weight to uncertain regions while preserving high probability of obtaining feasible solutions.

2) Propose heterogeneous likelihood Gaussian processes (HLGPs) as surrogate models for partially observable constraints. HLGPs attach individual likelihoods to feasible/infeasible observations, enabling better representation of feasibility compared to classifiers.  

3) Employ expectation propagation for efficient Gaussian approximation of the non-Gaussian posterior and predictions of HLGPs.

Main Contributions:

1) Design of EICB acquisition function and proof of its asymptotic convergence capability. EICB provides balanced improvements during optimization.

2) Introduction of HLGPs for modeling constraints based on mixed partial observations. HLGPs lead to more accurate feasibility representations.  

3) Overall proposed CBOB method for efficiently solving POCOPs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate competitiveness of CBOB versus state-of-the-art CBO techniques.

In summary, the paper makes useful contributions on acquisition function design and constraint modeling to enhance CBO methods for partially observable constrained optimization problems.
