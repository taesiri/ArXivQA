# [Constrained Bayesian Optimization Under Partial Observations: Balanced   Improvements and Provable Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03212)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) method called CBOB for efficiently solving partially observable constrained optimization problems (POCOPs). The method has two main components: 1) An improved acquisition function design called EICB that balances exploitation and exploration by incorporating a dynamic version of the probability of feasibility (DPOF). EICB is shown theoretically to converge to the global optimum. 2) A heterogeneity likelihood Gaussian process (HLGP) surrogate model that fully exploits both feasible and infeasible observations to more accurately represent constraints. Experiments on synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate CBOB's competitiveness against state-of-the-art CBO methods. The results show it obtains better solutions than methods like EIC, MESC, and TSC. The balanced exploration of EICB prevents over-exploitation of local feasible regions which improves optimization efficiency. Additionally, modeling constraints with HLGP outperforms classifier-based approaches like GPC. In summary, the proposed CBOB framework with EICB acquisition function and HLGP modeling is an efficient and provably convergent method for solving computationally expensive POCOPs.
