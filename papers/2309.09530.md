# [Adapting Large Language Models via Reading Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09530)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How does continued pre-training on domain-specific corpora influence large language models, and can transforming raw texts into reading comprehension exercises help adapt models to new domains while maintaining strong prompting performance?

The key points I gathered are:

- The authors investigate continued pre-training of large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific corpora, finding it improves performance on downstream domain tasks but hurts prompting ability. 

- They hypothesize this drop in prompting performance is because continued pre-training on raw domain texts limits the diversity of input-output patterns the model sees. 

- To address this, they propose transforming the raw texts into "reading comprehension" exercises with contextual Q&A tasks. 

- Their proposed method aims to impart domain knowledge from the raw texts, while the comprehension tasks provide diverse question-answering experiences to maintain strong prompting ability.

- Experiments across biomedicine, finance, and law domains show their adapted models (AdaptLLM) achieve improved performance on domain-specific tasks compared to the base LLM.

So in summary, the central research question seems to be examining how continued pre-training can best adapt LLMs to new domains, proposing and evaluating reading comprehension as a way to balance domain knowledge with prompting ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:

- The authors investigate continued pre-training of large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific corpora, revealing that this imparts domain knowledge but hurts prompting ability. 

- They propose a method to convert raw corpora into reading comprehension texts to learn domain knowledge while preserving prompting performance. Each raw text is enriched with comprehension tasks related to its content. 

- Experiments show their method consistently improves performance across biomedicine, finance, and law domains. Their 7B LLM achieves competitive results with much larger domain-specific models.

- The domain-specific reading comprehension texts also improve the model's performance on general benchmarks, demonstrating potential for developing a general LLM across more domains.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be a novel method of transforming domain corpora into reading comprehension texts to effectively adapt LLMs, acquiring domain knowledge while maintaining strong prompting ability. The consistency of improvements across domains and competitiveness with larger models highlight the significance of this contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on a quick skim of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes a method to adapt large language models to specific domains by converting raw text corpora into reading comprehension style texts and training the model on a mix of these texts and general instructions, which provides domain knowledge while maintaining the model's ability to perform well on question answering tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, here is my assessment of how this paper compares to related work:

- The paper explores domain adaptation for large language models (LLMs) via continued pre-training. This aligns with recent interest in adapting LLMs to specific domains like medicine, finance, and law. The authors contribute by analyzing continued pre-training specifically for LLMs and proposing a novel method of using reading comprehension to adapt LLMs.

- Most prior work has focused on supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on domain-specific data. In contrast, this paper investigates unsupervised continued pre-training. This is a less explored approach for domain adaptation of LLMs. The analysis on the tradeoffs of naive continued pre-training vs the proposed reading comprehension approach is a key contribution.

- The proposed method of transforming raw text into reading comprehension examples is simple but novel. Prior work has not explicitly converted pre-training data into this format to adapt LLMs. The technique of augmenting with general instructions is also not well explored in prior LLM adaptation studies.

- The paper demonstrates consistent gains across multiple domains by using the proposed approach. No other work has systematically evaluated domain adaptation for LLMs across medicine, finance, and law. The achieved results are competitive with much larger domain-specific models.

- The potential of using reading comprehension to develop general LLMs covering more domains is highlighted but not fully realized. The paper provides initial evidence but more work would be needed to develop truly multi-domain LLMs.

In summary, the key novelties are the focus on continued pre-training for LLM adaptation, the use of reading comprehension as a training technique, and the evaluations across multiple domains. The results are promising but expanding the approach to even broader domains remains future work. The paper advances knowledge on domain adaptation and application of LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different methods and architectures for adapting large language models to specific domains. The authors propose continued pre-training on reading comprehension style texts as one method, but suggest there may be other effective approaches as well.

- Extending this approach to adapt models to an even wider range of domains beyond the three explored in this paper (biomedicine, finance, law). The authors envision developing more general language models that can perform well across many different domains.

- Further analysis on the tradeoffs between acquiring domain-specific knowledge versus maintaining strong prompting performance during domain adaptation. The authors highlight this as an important consideration for adapting LLMs.

- Combining domain-specific knowledge acquired through pre-training with retrieval augmented prompting using external knowledge sources. The authors suggest their approach could complement retrieval-based methods.

- Development of better automatic metrics to evaluate the domain knowledge and prompting ability of adapted language models. The authors mainly rely on downstream task performance, so improved metrics could better analyze model strengths/weaknesses.

- Exploring different techniques for creating the reading comprehension style pre-training data from raw text corpora. The authors propose one method but suggest there may be other effective ways to structure the data.

In summary, the authors advocate for further work on efficient methods to adapt large language models to specialized domains while maintaining strong performance on core language modeling capabilities. Both the model architecture and pre-training data are areas for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores how continued pre-training on domain-specific corpora influences large language models. The authors find that training on raw corpora provides domain knowledge but hurts the model's prompting ability. To address this, they propose transforming raw corpora into reading comprehension texts by enriching each text with relevant questions and tasks. This method mimics human learning through reading comprehension practice. Experiments on biomedical, financial, and legal data show their approach, called AdaptLLM, consistently improves performance on domain-specific tasks compared to the original model and domain-adaptive pretraining on raw texts. It also achieves strong results compared to larger domain-specific models. The method demonstrates potential for developing generalized large language models across many domains.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores how continued pre-training of large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific corpora influences the models. The authors find that training LLMs on raw domain corpora provides the model with relevant domain knowledge but hurts its prompting ability. To address this issue, the authors propose a method to transform raw corpora into reading comprehension style texts, where each raw text is enriched with a series of comprehension tasks related to its content. This approach allows the model to learn domain knowledge from the raw texts while practicing its prompting skills on the appended tasks. 

Experiments conducted by the authors on continued pre-training with domains such as biomedicine, finance, and law demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach. The resulting model, AdaptLLM, shows consistent performance improvements on various domain-specific tasks under prompting, fine-tuning, and knowledge probing settings. Notably, AdaptLLM achieves competitive results compared to larger domain-specific models trained from scratch. The authors highlight the potential of their methodology to contribute to developing general LLMs that can perform well across diverse domains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a simple method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to specific domains by converting raw domain-specific corpora into reading comprehension texts. Each raw text is enriched with a series of comprehension tasks related to its content, including summarization, word-to-text, natural language inference, commonsense reasoning, paraphrase detection, and text completion. This transforms the raw texts into a format akin to reading comprehension passages followed by questions, aimed at improving the model's ability to answer questions using the context. Additionally, the authors mix these domain-specific comprehension texts with general instructions from prior work to further enhance the model's prompting ability. Experiments on adapting an LLM to the biomedical, finance, and law domains show that this approach improves performance on domain-specific tasks compared to continued pre-training on just the raw texts. The comprehension tasks provide domain knowledge while the mixing with general instructions preserves strong prompting ability.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper appears to be addressing the following main problem/question:

How to effectively adapt large language models (LLMs) to specific domains while maintaining good performance on general language tasks. 

In particular, the authors investigate whether continued pre-training of LLMs on domain-specific corpora is an effective approach for adapting the models. They find that while continued pre-training provides the model with domain knowledge, as evidenced by improved performance on domain fine-tuning tasks, it hurts the model's ability to perform well when prompted (zero-shot evaluation). 

To address this trade-off, the authors propose a method to transform raw domain corpora into "reading comprehension" texts, where each raw text is followed by comprehension questions/tasks related to its content. They show this approach allows the model to acquire domain knowledge while maintaining strong prompting performance. The key insight is that the comprehension tasks provide practice in answering questions from a context, enhancing prompting ability.

In summary, the main problem addressed is how to do domain adaptation for LLMs in a way that provides domain knowledge without sacrificing the model's ability to perform well when prompted in a zero-shot setting. The proposed solution is to convert domain corpora into reading comprehension texts to achieve both goals.
