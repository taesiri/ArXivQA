# [RING-NeRF: A Versatile Architecture based on Residual Implicit Neural   Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03357)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces RING-NeRF, a new neural radiance field architecture for 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. RING-NeRF is based on residual implicit neural grids that provide control over the level of detail of the mapping function between the scene space and latent space. Key advantages of RING-NeRF include: (1) it naturally represents scenes with continuous level of detail that avoids aliasing artifacts and enables spatial/resolution extensibility, (2) a distance-aware mapping mechanism that handles variations in observation distance without slowing training, and (3) a continuous coarse-to-fine training process that improves convergence and stability. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across tasks including anti-aliased rendering, reconstruction from few images, robustness for SDF models without scene-specific initialization, and dynamic spatial/resolution extensibility. Overall, RING-NeRF provides a simple yet versatile neural radiance field architecture with exceptional quality, speed, and robustness across diverse setups. Its residual mapping enables advantages over prior specialized methods without requiring their complexity.
