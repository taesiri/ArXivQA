# [FedSR: A Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning Algorithm for Non-IIDness   in IoT System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- In federated learning for IoT, data distributions across devices are typically non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-iid). This data heterogeneity causes federated learning models to perform poorly. 
- Traditional centralized federated learning also suffers from communication bottlenecks at the server when scaling to large numbers of devices.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FedSR, a semi-decentralized hierarchical federated learning framework with a star-ring topology. 
- Devices connect to edge servers and are organized into ring clusters for collaborative training. An incremental optimization algorithm is used for training in rings to improve model generalization and address data heterogeneity. 
- Edge servers aggregate model updates from rings and the cloud server aggregates from edges, reducing communication burden.

Key Contributions:
- Validates ring incremental training outperforms FedAvg in addressing data heterogeneity with only a small number of devices.
- Proposes the FedSR algorithm combining hierarchical federated learning with ring decentralized training for non-iid data.
- Provides theoretical analysis to show FedSR convergence guarantees with appropriate learning rate conditions.   
- Experiments on 4 image datasets demonstrate FedSR outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods on accuracy metrics for both iid and non-iid data distributions.
- Evaluates impacts of key FedSR hyperparameters and shows strong performance even with 100 devices and 20% participation rate per round.

In summary, the paper introduces FedSR, a hierarchical semi-decentralized federated learning approach using ring incremental training to address system heterogeneity and improve accuracy compared to existing methods.
