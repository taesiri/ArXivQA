# [CopyRNeRF: Protecting the CopyRight of Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11526)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goal is to develop a method to protect the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models by embedding invisible watermarks into them. Specifically, the authors aim to design a framework that can:

- Embed copyright messages into NeRF models in an invisible manner without deteriorating rendering quality.

- Ensure robust message extraction from rendered 2D images of the NeRF model, even under distortions like noise, blurring, etc. 

- Achieve high capacity by allowing long binary messages to be embedded.

- Guarantee consistency of the extracted messages across different rendered viewpoints.

The key hypothesis is that by manipulating the color component used for volume rendering in NeRF and fusing it with the copyright message, they can build an implicit watermarked color representation that achieves the goals above. They also hypothesize that a distortion-resistant rendering scheme during training can further enhance robustness against distortions.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop an effective copyright protection method for NeRF models through invisible watermarking, while meeting the criteria of imperceptibility, robustness, capacity and consistency. The core hypothesis is that manipulating the color representation in a careful manner can achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel method called CopyRNeRF to protect the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models by embedding invisible watermarks that can be extracted from rendered images. 

2. Introducing a watermarked color representation to embed the watermark into the color output of the NeRF model while keeping the geometry representation unchanged. This helps maintain high visual quality.

3. Designing a distortion-resistant rendering scheme during training to make the watermark robust to different rendering strategies and 2D distortions like noise, blurring, etc.

4. Achieving a good balance between invisibility, robustness, and capacity compared to other baseline methods on standard datasets. The embedded watermarks remain robust and consistent across different views.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an end-to-end framework to imperceptibly watermark NeRF models so that the ownership can be verified from rendered images. The method ensures invisibility, robustness to distortions, and view consistency without sacrificing reconstruction quality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes CopyRNeRF, a method to protect the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) 3D scene representations by embedding invisible watermark messages into the color component used for rendering while keeping the geometry representation unchanged, and using a distortion-resistant rendering approach during training to ensure robust message extraction from novel view syntheses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new method for protecting the copyright of neural radiance fields (NeRF) models by watermarking them. Here are some key ways this work compares to other research on protecting 3D models:

- Most prior work on 3D model watermarking focuses on explicitly represented models like meshes, whereas this method works for implicit neural representations like NeRF. This allows protecting copyright of the emerging paradigm of neural 3D representations.

- Many classic 3D watermarking techniques embed information by geometrically or topologically modifying the 3D model structure. Since NeRF has no explicit geometry, this paper embeds the watermark in the neural radiance color field while keeping the density/geometry field unchanged.

- The paper proposes a distortion-resistant rendering approach during training to make the extracted watermark robust to 2D distortions like blurring, cropping etc. This accounts for the difference between implicit 3D and explicit 2D and improves on simply applying 2D watermarking to rendered views.

- They achieve high capacity by hiding longer watermarks (up to 48 bits tested) with lower degradation compared to prior works that often embed only 1 bit. This is enabled by the neural representation.

- The method extracts watermarks from 2D rendered views rather than 3D space like some previous techniques. This fits better with implicit neural representations.

In summary, this work innovates over prior explicit 3D model watermarking by developing a strategy specialized for emerging neural 3D representations. The distortion-resistant rendering and high-capacity watermark embedding leveraging the neural representation are notable contributions. The comparisons show how this approach is tailored for the unique properties of neural scene representations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving the training speed of NeRF models. The authors acknowledge that training a NeRF model is time-consuming, so speeding up the training process could be important future work. They suggest considering how to accelerate the training.

- Making the model more robust to direct attacks on the model weights. The authors note that directly corrupting the model weights could undermine the robustness of the copyright protection, so handling such attacks could be an area for future work. 

- Generalizing the approach to video and generative models. The authors focus on protecting the copyright of a single NeRF model representing a static scene. Extending the approach to video NeRFs or generative NeRF models could be an interesting direction.

- Reducing the performance overhead. The authors' method requires training an additional watermarked color representation model alongside the base NeRF model. Research into reducing this overhead could help improve efficiency.

- Protecting model weights directly. The current approach protects copyright by embedding a signal in the rendered outputs. Developing a method to directly watermark model weights could be explored.

- Considering adversarial attacks. While the authors evaluate robustness to distortions like blurring and noise, adversarial attacks aimed specifically at fooling the watermark could be a threat worth studying. 

- Extending to other neural 3D representations beyond NeRF. The principles could potentially be applied to other neural implicit 3D models.

So in summary, the key suggestions are around improving efficiency and robustness, extending the approach to video/generative settings, and protecting model weights directly. Exploring adversarial attacks and other 3D representations are also proposed future directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes CopyRNeRF, a method to protect the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models by embedding invisible watermarks into the models that can later be extracted from rendered images. The key ideas are:

1) They embed the watermark into the color output of the NeRF model rather than the geometry output, as geometry is more difficult to consistently extract from 2D images. 

2) They use a watermarked color representation module that takes as input the color, 3D position, view direction, and watermark message to output a watermarked color. This allows invisibly fusing the message while maintaining consistency across views.

3) They use a distortion-resistant rendering scheme during training that applies random distortions like blurring and noise. This makes the extracted watermark more robust to distortions.

4) The embedded watermark can be extracted by a CNN-based extractor from rendered images, even under distortions and different rendering strategies.

In experiments, they show the method achieves high invisibility with PSNR 26dB and high robustness recovering the watermark under noise, blurring, etc. The method helps prove ownership of a stolen NeRF model by extracting the watermark from rendered images.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes CopyRNeRF, a method to protect the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models by embedding invisible watermarks. NeRF models have become a popular implicit 3D scene representation, but require significant effort to train. The authors argue that directly watermarking rendered 2D images from a NeRF model does not protect the core model itself if stolen. Instead, they propose to build a watermarked color representation within the NeRF model by fusing an embedded message with the color prediction. This allows invisible watermarks to be consistently embedded and extracted from any rendered views. To strengthen robustness, the authors also propose distortion-resistant rendering during training, which applies random 2D distortions like blurring to render patches and help withstand distortions. Experiments show the method achieves high visual quality and message robustness.

Specifically, the watermarked color representation takes the original color, viewing direction, 3D location, and binary message as input. It builds separate feature fields for color and message, then fuses them to output the watermarked color. Distortion-resistant rendering randomly samples rays and applies distortions to rendered patches during training only. At test time, a CNN extractor can reliably extract messages from rendered views despite distortions. Evaluated on standard datasets, the method shows higher capacity over length and robustness to distortions versus baselines. Limitations include training time and direct model weight attacks. The method contributes a novel application of implicit watermarking to protect copyright of learned 3D representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes CopyRNeRF, a method to protect the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models. The key idea is to embed an invisible watermark into the color representation used by NeRF for rendering, while keeping the geometry representation unchanged. Specifically, the method builds a watermarked color representation by fusing a color feature field, message feature field, and original color values from NeRF. The color feature field encodes position, view direction, and original color. The message feature field transforms the binary message into a higher dimensional space. Fusing these fields produces a watermarked color that embeds the message while maintaining high visual quality. During training, a distortion-resistant rendering scheme is used, applying distortions like blurring and noise to image patches to make message extraction robust. The embedded message can then be extracted from any rendered image using a CNN-based message extractor. This allows proving ownership of a stolen NeRF model.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is how to protect the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models. Some key points:

- NeRF models are complex and time-consuming to train, so it's important to protect their intellectual property if they are stolen/copied by others. 

- Existing methods like directly watermarking rendered NeRF images don't fully protect the core model itself. Watermarking the model weights directly is also challenging.

- The paper proposes a new method called CopyRNeRF to address this. The key ideas are:

1) Instead of watermarking the entire model, they create a separate "watermarked color representation" module that can embed messages into the rendered color while keeping the base model unchanged.

2) They use a distortion-resistant rendering approach during training to make the extracted messages robust to different rendering strategies/distortions at test time.

3) The watermarked color representation uses spatial information to keep messages consistent across views.

So in summary, the main problem is protecting the copyright of NeRF models in a way that embeds invisible watermarks while allowing robust message extraction from rendered views. CopyRNeRF is proposed as a new method to address this problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF): The paper focuses on protecting the copyright of Neural Radiance Fields models. NeRF is a neural representation that can synthesize novel views of a scene by mapping a 3D location and viewing direction to volume density and emitted radiance.

- Digital watermarking: The proposed approach embeds copyright messages into NeRF models to claim ownership. This is done through digital watermarking, the process of hiding information into digital content like images, audio, or 3D models.

- Implicit 3D representation: NeRF is an implicit representation where scene properties like geometry and appearance are encoded in the weights of a neural network. The paper aims to watermark such implicit 3D models.

- Robustness: A key criteria for the watermarking system is robustness - the embedded messages should be extractable even if the rendered images are distorted or different rendering schemes are used.

- Invisibility: The watermarked NeRF models should synthesize high quality novel views without visible artifacts from the embedded messages. This invisibility is important for digital watermarking.

- Message embedding: The core of the approach is strategically embedding copyright messages into the NeRF model's color representation while keeping the geometry unchanged.

- Distortion-resistant rendering: A novel training procedure to make message extraction robust against distortions like noise, blurring, etc. and changes in rendering.

- Bit accuracy: Quantitative metric to evaluate correct extraction of the embedded binary message bits. Used along with image quality metrics.

In summary, the key focus is robust and invisible watermarking of implicit NeRF models through message embedding into the color representation and distortion-resistant rendering.
