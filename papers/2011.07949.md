# [RSPNet: Relative Speed Perception for Unsupervised Video Representation   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07949)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is:How can we learn effective video representations in an unsupervised manner, especially learning useful features for both motion and appearance?The key points are:- Unsupervised video representation learning is very challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal information in videos and lack of labeled data. - Existing methods using playback speed perception as pretext task suffer from imprecise speed labels. Also they do not explicitly encourage learning appearance features.- This paper proposes to use relative speed perception as pretext task which can provide more consistent supervision. - It also extends instance discrimination from images to videos and uses speed augmentation so the model focuses more on appearance. - By combining the two pretext tasks, the model can learn useful features for both motion and appearance in an unsupervised manner.- Experiments show the learned features achieve excellent performance on downstream action recognition and video retrieval without using any manually annotated data.In summary, the main research question is how to do unsupervised video representation learning, especially learning features for both motion and appearance. The key ideas are exploiting relative speed and extending instance discrimination with speed augmentation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new self-supervised learning method called RSPNet for video representation learning without using any labels. The key ideas are:- Proposing a relative speed perception (RSP) task that identifies the relative playback speed between two clips instead of predicting their specific playback speeds. This provides more precise supervision to learn motion features. - Extending instance discrimination task to video domain with an appearance-focused video instance discrimination (A-VID) task. It encourages models to learn appearance features by distinguishing whether two clips are from the same video. - Combining the RSP and A-VID tasks in a unified framework to learn spatiotemporal features capturing both motion and appearance information from unlabeled videos.- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on downstream action recognition and video retrieval tasks. Remarkably, RSPNet outperforms ImageNet supervised pretraining on UCF101 action recognition by a large margin.In summary, the key contribution is designing effective pretext tasks and combining them in a principled framework for self-supervised video representation learning without any manual labels. The learned features generalize very well to downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised video representation learning method called RSPNet that learns motion features through a relative speed perception task and appearance features through an appearance-focused video instance discrimination task on unlabeled videos, achieving strong performance on downstream action recognition without needing annotated data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in unsupervised video representation learning:- The main novel contribution is proposing relative speed perception (RSP) as a pretext task. Most prior work has focused on predicting absolute playback speeds. Using relative speed labels is more consistent with motion patterns and provides better supervision.- This paper combines RSP with a video instance discrimination task (A-VID) to learn both motion and appearance features. Other methods tend to focus on either motion (e.g. speed perception) or appearance (e.g. context prediction), but not both. Jointly optimizing RSP and A-VID helps learn more balanced features.- For A-VID, they use a speed augmentation strategy to make models focus on appearance rather than speed cues. This is a simple but effective idea not explored by other video instance discrimination methods. - The two-branch architecture optimizing RSP and A-VID with a shared encoder is quite standard. But the design of the pretext tasks themselves is novel.- Without any labeled data for pre-training, RSPNet achieves 93.7% on UCF-101, outperforming supervised ImageNet pre-training. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach for learning useful video representations.- Compared to concurrent self-supervised methods like CoCLR and MemDPC, RSPNet achieves competitive or better results on UCF-101 and HMDB51 with a conceptually simpler framework.In summary, this paper introduces creative pretext tasks tailored for videos and combines motion and appearance learning more effectively than prior work. The results validate their design choices and demonstrate state-of-the-art transfer learning performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing methods to learn longer-term motion dependencies beyond single clips or pairs of clips. The current methods mainly focus on short clips or pairs, but modeling longer sequences could help capture more complex motions and actions. - Exploring different combinations and formulations of the relative speed perception and appearance-focused tasks. The authors show these two tasks are complementary, but more work could be done to find optimal ways to combine them.- Applying the unsupervised pre-training approach to a wider range of video understanding tasks beyond classification, such as detection, segmentation, captioning. The authors demonstrate results on action recognition and retrieval, but the learned features could likely transfer to other tasks as well.- Scaling up the model training with larger datasets, longer videos, and deeper networks. The authors suggest that using larger datasets like Kinetics-600 or -700 during pre-training could further improve the performance.- Investigating the role of various augmentations during pre-training and fine-tuning. The data augmentations like speed perturbation seem important but their effects could be analyzed in more depth.- Studying the transferability of the self-supervised features to various downstream architectures. The authors transfer to standard CNNs but the features could be evaluated when transferred to other architectures.In summary, the main future directions are developing methods to model longer-term motion, finding optimal task formulations, transferring to more tasks, scaling up model size and data, analyzing data augmentations, and studying transferability across different architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new approach for unsupervised video representation learning called RSPNet. The key idea is to use relative speed perception between pairs of video clips as a pretext task to learn good motion features, instead of predicting the absolute playback speed which can be inconsistent. Specifically, given two clips from the same video, the model tries to identify which clip is faster. To also learn appearance features, they propose an appearance-focused video instance discrimination task where the model tries to identify two clips from the same video among negative clips from other videos. They use a speed augmentation strategy to prevent the model from solving this task based on speed alone. The two tasks are combined in a multi-task learning framework with a shared encoder and task-specific projection heads. Experiments on action recognition and video retrieval show state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods. Without any annotated pre-training data, RSPNet outperforms ImageNet supervised pre-training on UCF101 action recognition. The learned features thus capture both meaningful motion and appearance information.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel method for unsupervised video representation learning called RSPNet. The key idea is to learn motion and appearance features from unlabeled videos through two pretext tasks - relative speed perception (RSP) and appearance-focused video instance discrimination (A-VID). For RSP, they compare the relative playback speeds of two clips from the same video rather than predict the absolute speeds. This provides more consistent supervision to learn motion features. For A-VID, they extend image instance discrimination to videos and introduce speed augmentation so the model focuses on appearance, not speed. They use a two-branch architecture to train on these tasks jointly. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on downstream action recognition and retrieval without using labeled data. Key results are 93.7% on UCF-101 outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training and qualitative visualizations showing the model focuses on informative regions for each task. The unified framework is effective for unsupervised representation learning on both motion and appearance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new unsupervised video representation learning framework called RSPNet. The key ideas are: 1) Using relative playback speed between two video clips as labels instead of predicting the absolute speed of each clip. This provides more precise supervision for learning motion features. 2) Extending instance discrimination from images to videos by distinguishing whether two clips are from the same video. To focus on appearance, they randomly sample clips at different speeds so motion can't be used as a cue. 3) A two-branch architecture to jointly optimize a relative speed perception (RSP) task and an appearance-focused video instance discrimination (A-VID) task. The RSP task helps learn motion features while the A-VID task helps learn appearance. By combining both tasks, the model learns better video representations containing both motion and appearance information in an unsupervised manner. Experiments show strong performance on action recognition and video retrieval without any annotated labels for pre-training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it appears the authors are addressing the following key problems/questions:1. Unsupervised video representation learning is challenging due to the complexity of spatial-temporal information in videos and the lack of labeled data for training. It is difficult to learn good representations for both motion and appearance features simultaneously. 2. Existing methods that use speed perception for self-supervised pretext tasks suffer from imprecise speed labels, as the speed labels may not align well with actual motion content. This makes the labels less effective for learning good motion representations.3. Speed perception based pretext tasks mainly focus on motion features but do not explicitly encourage models to also learn useful appearance features, which are important for many video understanding tasks. 4. How can we obtain more consistent and precise labels to supervise motion feature learning in an unsupervised video representation learning framework?5. How can we combine motion-focused and appearance-focused pretext tasks effectively to learn representations that capture both motion and appearance information from unlabeled videos?In summary, the key focus is on developing better self-supervised pretext tasks and training frameworks to learn more discriminative and robust spatio-temporal video representations without reliance on manual annotations. The proposed solutions aim to address limitations of prior work in effectively modeling motion and appearance in an unsupervised manner.
