# [ENTED: Enhanced Neural Texture Extraction and Distribution for   Reference-based Blind Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of blind face restoration (BFR) - restoring high quality facial images from low quality inputs when the type of degradation is unknown. BFR is challenging as human perception is sensitive to facial details, so accurately reconstructing identity information is difficult, especially from badly corrupted inputs. The paper explores using an additional high quality reference image of the same person to guide restoration.

Method:
The paper proposes a novel framework called ENTED that utilizes a texture extraction and distribution module to transfer high quality texture features from the reference to the low quality input image. However, directly applying this module leads to two issues:
1) The latent code from the low quality input contains corrupted semantic information that misguides texture transfer. 
2) Generating realistic textures requires high quality style codes, which is difficult from the noisy low quality input. 

To address issue 1, a vector quantization technique is used to replace corrupted latent codes with codes from a high quality dictionary. For issue 2, a cross-attention mechanism refines the latent space using the reference image to create a more informative space for generating better style codes. 

Additionally, residual connections are added to preserve facial identity information from the input image, and modulated convolutions are used to generate high-frequency texture details.

Contributions:
- A reference-based blind face restoration method using texture transfer and latent space refinement techniques.
- A vector quantization approach to replace corrupted semantic information from the low quality input image.  
- Cross-attention with the reference image to create an improved latent space for style code generation.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for blind face restoration.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a reference-based blind face restoration framework called ENTED that utilizes neural texture extraction and distribution along with vector quantization and latent space refinement techniques to effectively transfer high-quality textures from a reference image to restore details in a degraded input image.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

1. They apply a latent space refinement technique that can utilize the information from the high-quality reference prior for generating style code that carries high-quality semantic details. 

2. To facilitate the texture distribution process, they modify the texture extraction and distribution framework by adopting the vector-quantization technique.

3. Extensive experiments show that their model advances the state-of-the-art method in blind face restoration. It can handle badly corrupted face images from both real-world and synthetic data.

So in summary, the main contributions are: (1) latent space refinement for high-quality style code generation, (2) modifying the texture extraction/distribution framework with vector quantization, and (3) advancing the state-of-the-art in blind face restoration, especially for handling corrupted images.
