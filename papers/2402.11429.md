# [Deformable Object Manipulation With Constraints Using Path Set Planning   and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11429)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Deformable object manipulation (DOM) has many applications but is challenging to perform autonomously, especially when environmental or task constraints are present. Constraints like collision avoidance and limiting deformation are common but difficult to handle due to factors like unknown deformation models and varying environments. Existing methods either rely on explicit modeling/simulation, which is computationally costly, or assume unconstrained settings. A general approach for constrained DOM is lacking.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an integrated manipulation framework for DOM under constraints based on path set planning and tracking. 

1) Constrained tasks are formulated as an optimization problem with dynamic constraint imposition enabled through an activation vector.

2) For task execution lacking analytical solvability, path set planning of the visual feedback vector is introduced. It collects paths for individual feedback points to provide motion/path references for the deformable object (DO). Efficient algorithms are developed for path set generation in constrained environments, which involve passage-aware planning, repositioning and deformable transfer of the pivot path. Theoretical analysis shows the path set has useful properties like being strong homotopic-like.

3) A control architecture with path set tracking, constraint regulation and local minimum resolution is designed. Constraint activation states are determined using environment information and the planned path set. Interleaving of path set tracking and direct end-effector control handles conflicting motions and avoids getting stuck.

Main Contributions:
1) A manipulation framework integrating path planning and control for DOM under constraints.

2) Comprehensive analysis and efficient algorithms for visual feedback vector path set planning in constrained environments.

3) A control architecture subsumes constraint regulation, coordinated path set tracking and local minimum resolution to accomplish constrained DOM tasks.

The effectiveness of proposed methods, including superior performance over pure deformation control approaches, is validated on various DOM tasks with constraints.
