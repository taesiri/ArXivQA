# [Addressing Concept Shift in Online Time Series Forecasting:   Detect-then-Adapt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14949)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Online updating of time series forecasting models aims to tackle concept drifts (changes in data distribution over time) by adjusting models based on streaming data. However, most methods focus only on model updating and struggle to handle large concept drifts, resulting in performance deterioration over time. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new approach called Concept Drift Detection and Adaptation (D3A) with two key components:

1) Concept Drift Detector: Monitors forecasting losses over a sliding window and uses a statistical test to detect significant increases in loss distribution that likely indicate a concept drift.

2) Model Adaptation Strategy: When concept drift is detected, historical data is augmented with instance-dependent Gaussian noise before retraining the model. This reduces the train-test distribution gap which is a key factor causing performance decline. Theoretical analysis shows this bridge the gap for linear models.

Main Contributions:

1) Introduces a concept drift detection framework to trigger model adaptation when significant drifts occur, enhancing model robustness.

2) Proposes an innovative data augmentation strategy using historical data to enable rapid model adaptation to new concepts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Justification provided through theoretical analysis.

3) Evaluates models under more realistic setting with delayed feedback.

4) Achieves superior performance across 6 datasets. For example, reduces MSE by 43.9% over a TCN baseline. Outperforms state-of-the-art model FSNet by reducing MSE by 33.3%. Consistent gains under delayed feedback setting.

The main novelty lies in explicitly detecting concept drifts to drive model adaptation rather than passive updating, along with the data augmentation strategy to leverage historical data more effectively. This enhances model robustness and safety for real-world deployment.
