# [Out-of-Distribution Detection for Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06072)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it addresses is: How to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples for monocular depth estimation models? 

Specifically, the authors propose a method to detect OOD inputs for encoder-decoder monocular depth estimation models, without needing to modify or retrain the models. Their key idea is to train an image reconstruction decoder in a post-hoc manner using the features from the depth estimation encoder, and use the reconstruction error as an OOD detection score.

The main hypothesis is that since the image decoder is trained only on in-distribution data, it will not be able to reconstruct OOD inputs well, leading to a high reconstruction error that can be used to detect OOD samples.

In summary, the central research question is how to perform OOD detection for monocular depth estimation, and the key hypothesis is that an image reconstruction decoder trained on in-distribution data can be used for this purpose. The authors evaluate their method extensively on different models and datasets to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- The authors propose a method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for monocular depth estimation models. They introduce an evaluation protocol to assess epistemic uncertainty and OOD detection performance.

- They train an image decoder in a post hoc fashion on the features from a pretrained depth estimation encoder. The image reconstruction error from this decoder is used as the OOD detection score. 

- They demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach compared to existing uncertainty estimation methods on standard benchmarks like NYU Depth V2 and KITTI. The method performs well across different network architectures like convolutional and transformer-based models.

- The ablation studies justify their design choices such as training the image decoder post hoc rather than jointly or using an autoencoder. The results show their method outperforms uncertainty estimation baselines while not affecting the depth prediction performance.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be a simple and effective post hoc OOD detection method for monocular depth estimation based on image reconstruction, along with a protocol to evaluate epistemic uncertainty and OOD detection for this task. The method is shown to work well across different network architectures without modifying the pretrained depth model.
