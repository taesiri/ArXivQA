# [FACET: Fairness in Computer Vision Evaluation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00035)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Do current state-of-the-art computer vision models exhibit performance disparities on common vision tasks (e.g. classification, detection, segmentation) based on the demographic attributes (e.g. perceived gender, skin tone, age) of people in the images? - Can a new benchmark dataset help detect and analyze these potential performance disparities across demographic groups?Specifically, the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset called FACET to evaluate model fairness on common vision tasks. The key hypothesis seems to be that by exhaustively annotating a diverse set of images on various demographic attributes of people, this benchmark can enable deeper analysis of biases and disparities in vision models across different attributes and intersections of attributes.The main goal appears to be using the FACET benchmark to uncover potential biases and performance gaps in vision models based on demographic factors. The paper presents analysis using FACET to highlight some disparities found in existing models as evidence that the benchmark can serve its intended purpose as an evaluation tool for model fairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing FACET, a new large-scale benchmark dataset for evaluating fairness in computer vision models. FACET contains over 30,000 images annotated with demographics, attributes, and labels for common vision tasks like classification and detection.2. Providing exhaustive manual annotations for over 49,000 people across 13 attributes like perceived gender, skin tone, age, etc. This allows for intersectional analysis to uncover biases related to combinations of attributes. 3. Analyzing several state-of-the-art vision models (CLIP, Faster R-CNN, Detic, OFA) using FACET to quantify performance disparities across demographic groups. The results demonstrate how FACET can be used to detect biases and fairness issues in vision models.4. Releasing FACET publicly to lower the barriers for evaluating model fairness and encourage development of fairer, more robust vision models. The authors designed FACET to be easily adoptable by having class labels overlap with ImageNet-21K.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of the new FACET benchmark, which enables more comprehensive evaluation of fairness in vision models compared to prior datasets. The public release of FACET is intended to promote further research into mitigating biases and developing fairer computer vision.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of fairness in computer vision:- The paper introduces a new large-scale benchmark dataset called FACET for evaluating computer vision models for fairness concerns. This adds to existing datasets for fairness evaluation like FairFace, UTKFace, and Diversity in Faces. FACET is more exhaustive than these datasets with over 30K images annotated with 13 attributes for nearly 50K people.- A key contribution of FACET is the breadth of vision tasks it supports - image classification, object detection, segmentation, and visual grounding. Many prior fairness datasets focus only on classification for facial analysis. The multi-task support allows for a more comprehensive analysis of model biases.- The paper demonstrates how FACET can be used to probe biases and performance disparities across demographic attributes like gender, skin tone, and age for standard models. Analyzing intersectional biases (e.g. skin tone + hair type) is highlighted as a unique capability. Prior work has evaluated bias across individual attributes, but less work looks at compounding biases.- FACET uses the Monk Skin Tone scale which is more inclusive, particularly for darker skin tones, than the commonly used Fitzpatrick scale. appropriately capturing diversity in skin tone is an active area of research.- The annotations come from trained expert raters chosen specifically to increase geographic diversity. Many datasets use crowdsourcing which can result in noisier, biased labels. The care in sourcing annotators is noteworthy.- The paper and dataset seem to follow or reference emerging best practices around documenting datasets through data cards and considering ethical aspects. This reflects the increasing focus on ethics and transparency in dataset development.Overall, FACET moves forward the goal of auditing vision models for biases with its breadth of tasks, intersectional analysis, focus on high-quality annotations, and responsible data practices. The benchmark and its thorough analysis help expose where current models fall short in equitable performance across diverse demographic groups.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing techniques to further reduce disparities and biases in vision models when evaluated on the FACET benchmark. The authors show there are still significant gaps in performance across demographic groups, so more work is needed to create fairer models.- Expanding the analysis to additional attributes and intersections of attributes. The exhaustive FACET annotations enable exploring many attributes, but there are opportunities to dig deeper, especially with respect to intersections of multiple attributes.- Incorporating additional vision tasks into the benchmark. FACET currently supports classification, detection and segmentation tasks. Expanding it to include other common vision tasks like keypoints detection could reveal additional fairness issues.- Analyzing model biases on datasets beyond FACET. While FACET enables detailed analysis, evaluating other widely used datasets with this same rigor could uncover new findings.- Developing techniques to mitigate reliance on demographic annotations for model evaluations. The authors acknowledge concerns around using discrete labels for attributes like gender. New methods that avoid discrete labels could be promising.- Expanding the analysis to additional social groups and biases like race, ethnicity, ability status, etc. The current FACET annotations focus on gender, age and skin tone but could be expanded.- Developing standards and best practices for benchmarking model fairness. As more vision fairness benchmarks emerge, collectively establishing useful guidelines could advance the field.In summary, the authors highlight many opportunities to build on FACET to further advance the understanding, evaluation and improvement of fairness in computer vision models. Analyzing new models, tasks, datasets, attributes and social groups can reveal additional insights into where progress is still needed.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents FACET, a new large-scale benchmark dataset for evaluating fairness in computer vision models. FACET contains over 30,000 images annotated with exhaustive person-level attributes like perceived gender, skin tone, and age group. The images also have labels for 52 fine-grained person-related classes like guitarist, nurse, etc. Along with class labels, each image has manually drawn bounding boxes around people. A subset of images also contains masks labeled as person, clothing or hair. The benchmark enables analyzing model performance across demographic groups on common vision tasks like classification, detection and segmentation. Experiments with FACET show existing models exhibit performance disparities correlated with demographic groups. For example, the Faster R-CNN detection model performs worse on people with darker perceived skin tones. FACET provides a unified benchmark to assess model fairness across vision tasks using detailed demographic and visual attribute annotations.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called FACET (Fairness in Computer Vision Evaluation) to help evaluate fairness and bias in computer vision models. The key questions and problems it aims to address are:- Computer vision models are known to have performance disparities and biases based on demographic attributes like gender, skin tone, and age. However, existing datasets are limited in their ability to thoroughly evaluate these biases across different vision tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation. - There is no unified benchmark that contains exhaustive demographic annotations alongside vision task labels to enable in-depth analysis of model biases across different attributes and their intersections.- Existing datasets focus only on a subset of vision tasks and have sparse demographic annotations. For example, some only have gender and age, while others like CelebA contain more attributes but are limited to face images. - There is a need for a large-scale benchmark that contains diverse images labeled for common vision tasks like classification and detection, with exhaustive annotations of demographic and other attributes per person to enable fine-grained analysis of model biases.To address these limitations, the paper introduces FACET - a new large benchmark containing over 30K manually annotated images with bounding boxes and segmentation masks for nearly 50K people. The key aspects are:- 52 person-related classes like doctor, guitarist, backpacker etc that overlap with ImageNet-21K for easy adoption.- 13 demographic and additional attributes annotated per person like gender, skin tone, age, hair type, lighting condition etc. - Support for evaluating model fairness across classification, detection, segmentation and visual grounding tasks.- Detailed benchmark experiments evaluating biases in existing models across attributes and demonstrating FACET's capabilities.In summary, FACET tackles the limitations of existing datasets and provides a unified resource to thoroughly evaluate model fairness for major vision tasks across a diverse set of attributes and their intersections.
