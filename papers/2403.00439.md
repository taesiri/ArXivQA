# [Authors' Values and Attitudes Towards AI-bridged Scalable   Personalization of Creative Language Arts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00439)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generative AI models like large language models (LLMs) have the capability to generate personalized content that bridges authors and audiences. However, it is unclear what authors' values and attitudes are regarding this new form of creative language arts (CLA) media, which the authors term as "AI-bridged CLA." 

Solution:
To understand authors' perspectives, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 professional CLA authors across 8 genres (e.g. poetry, novels). They presented the authors with speculative but realistic scenarios of AI-bridged CLA. 

Key Findings:

1) Authors derive benefits from: the creative process, audiences getting value from the artifacts, and feedback/rewards from audiences. 

2) Authors had varied reactions to AI-bridged CLA depending on which benefits they prioritized. Authors who valued uniqueness and self-expression tended to dislike changes by the AI, while others were fine with changes as long as core ideas were preserved.

3) Many authors saw potential benefits of AI-bridged CLA in making artifacts more understandable, immersive and commercially valuable. However, authors raised concerns about AI quality, ethical issues, uncertain value for audiences, and impacts on the profession.

4) To address concerns, the authors suggest AI-bridged CLA systems should: enable flexible authorial control over variations, generate estimations of possible variations, record streams of variations, prevent unauthorized deviations, and facilitate author-audience interactions.

In summary, the paper explores authors' expectations of AI-bridged CLA using speculative probes. It identifies a spectrum of author reactions and benefits, maps out author-audience dynamics with AI, and provides design implications for supporting generative AI in CLA.
