# [Designing AI Support for Human Involvement in AI-assisted Decision   Making: A Taxonomy of Human-AI Interactions from a Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19778)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a systematic review of 105 studies on human-AI interactions in AI-advised decision-making contexts. The authors analyzed the sequences of interactions between humans and AI agents across various application domains to identify common interaction patterns. They propose a taxonomy of 7 main interaction patterns: AI-first assistance, AI-follow assistance, secondary assistance, request-driven AI assistance, AI-guided dialogic user engagement, user-guided interactive adjustments, and delegation. The taxonomy reveals that most current practices lean towards AI-driven or human-led processes, with limited interactivity. The authors advocate for more deliberate design choices to enhance collaboration between humans and AI. They note gaps regarding continuous interactions, multi-agent collaborations, real-world complexities, and relevance of AI assistance. The taxonomy serves as a valuable resource to inform the design of AI systems to foster productive and user-centered human-AI interactions. Key recommendations include empowering user agency through request-driven interactions, facilitating dialogues for responsive engagements, and exploring dynamic task allocations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a systematic review of 105 articles on human-AI interaction in AI-advised decision making tasks, analyzing the interaction patterns and proposing a taxonomy of 7 types of interactions: AI-first assistance, AI-follow assistance, secondary assistance, request-driven AI assistance, AI-guided dialogic user engagement, user-guided interactive adjustments, and delegation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a systematic review of 105 studies on human-AI interaction in AI-assisted decision making contexts. The authors analyzed the sequences of interactions in these studies to identify common interaction patterns, which they categorized into 7 types: AI-first assistance, AI-follow assistance, secondary assistance, request-driven AI assistance, AI-guided dialogic user engagement, user-guided interactive adjustments, and delegation. The most prevalent were AI-first and AI-follow assistance. More interactive patterns like request-driven assistance and user adjustments were less common. Based on their analysis, the authors propose a taxonomy of interaction patterns that provides a structured framework for understanding and designing human-AI interactions. They argue that deliberate choices are needed in designing interactions to enhance collaboration between humans and AI. The taxonomy can inform the development of AI systems to foster more productive and user-centered interactions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a taxonomy of seven common interaction patterns between humans and AI agents during decision-making tasks, developed through a systematic review of over 100 empirical studies across domains, to provide a framework for understanding and deliberately designing human-AI interactions.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper does not have a single central research question or hypothesis. Rather, it conducts a systematic review and analysis of existing literature on human-AI interactions in AI-assisted decision making contexts. The goals of the paper are to:

1) Review empirical studies evaluating human-AI interactions during decision-making tasks when AI assistance is provided.

2) Identify common interaction patterns between humans and AI agents across different studies and application domains. 

3) Propose a taxonomy that classifies these interaction patterns into categories. 

4) Understand the landscape of domains, tasks, evaluation methods and measures used in studies of AI-assisted human decision making. 

5) Discuss gaps, limitations, and opportunities for future research on human-AI interaction patterns.

So in summary, this paper reviews prior work to inform the formulation of a taxonomy of human-AI interaction patterns, rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The taxonomy aims to provide a common framework and vocabulary for human-AI interactions that can guide the design of better AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a taxonomy of seven interaction patterns that characterize different ways in which humans can interact with AI agents during decision-making tasks. The taxonomy was developed through a systematic review of 105 empirical studies on human-AI interaction, by analyzing the sequences of interactions between humans and AI systems across different domains and applications. The identified patterns include AI-first assistance, AI-follow assistance, secondary assistance, request-driven AI assistance, AI-guided dialogic user engagement, user-guided interactive adjustments, and delegation. The taxonomy serves as a structured framework for understanding existing interaction paradigms and making deliberate design choices to develop more effective and user-centered AI systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several key contributions compared to prior research on human-AI interaction:

1) It provides the first comprehensive taxonomy of interaction patterns between humans and AI during decision-making tasks. While prior work has categorized some aspects of human-AI interaction (e.g. levels of automation, user control), this paper develops a more detailed framework grounded in empirical evidence from over 100 studies. 

2) The taxonomy covers seven main types of interactions and uses consistent terminology and diagrams to illustrate the sequences of actions within each pattern. This provides a common language to describe ways humans can collaborate with AI.

3) Through a systematic review, the authors analyze trends of interaction patterns used across various domains. This reveals that current practices lean heavily towards simplistic human-AI workflows, with more interactive functionality being less common. 

4) The paper discusses limitations of certain dominant paradigms (e.g. potential biases introduced in AI-first and AI-follow designs) and advocates for more deliberate choices in interaction protocols to foster engaging collaborations.

5) Compared to prior surveys focused specifically on explainable AI systems, this work examines human-AI interaction more broadly, beyond just the role of explanations. The taxonomy applies to multiple types of AI assistance.

In summary, this paper makes important theoretical and practical contributions by structuring the design space of human-AI interactions, providing a foundation to understand existing practices, highlight current gaps, and inform development of better solutions. The taxonomy serves as a valuable tool for researchers and designers working on AI-based decision support systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions, including:

1. Evaluating continuous user interaction scenarios, where user input is sustained and can receive AI feedback at any given moment, rather than just intermittent turn-taking interactions.

2. Studying multi-agent teamwork collaboration, with interactions between multiple users and AI agents, rather than just a single user and AI agent. This could include exploring task coordination and allocation between agents.

3. Using more realistic and complex decision-making tasks, rather than just artificial or simulated tasks. This includes exposing decision-makers to the full consequences of their choices.

4. Evaluating the relevance of AI assistance in simpler tasks when humans can easily complete the task themselves, and questioning the experimental relevance to real-world applicability.  

5. Studying interactions with domain experts who have specialized capabilities that can influence the choice and efficacy of interactions with AI. Questions remain about the universality of interaction patterns across varied user groups.
