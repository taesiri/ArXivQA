# [CleanAgent: Automating Data Standardization with LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08291)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Data standardization is an important but complex process in data science. It involves transforming heterogeneous data formats within a column into a unified format. Traditionally this requires manually writing intricate Pandas code which is inefficient. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language conversations. However, this still requires significant human effort for prompt crafting and refinement.

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to design a Python library called Dataprep.Clean with declarative APIs to simplify standardizing column types. For example, clean_date() can standardize dates in one line. Then propose CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM agents to fully automate data standardization. It allows users to provide requirements only once for a hands-free process.

Main Contributions:
1) Propose Dataprep.Clean library with 142 unified APIs to reduce complexity of standardizing column types 
2) Propose CleanAgent framework combining Dataprep.Clean and LLM agents to enable automatic end-to-end data standardization
3) Implement CleanAgent as user-friendly web application for demonstration. The implementation is also open-sourced.

In summary, the paper aims to automate the intricate data standardization process by designing a declarative Python library for standardization and integrating it with LLM agents. This simplifies the task for LLM agents and enables a hands-free workflow after initial user requirements.
