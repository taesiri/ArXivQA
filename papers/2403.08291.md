# [CleanAgent: Automating Data Standardization with LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08291)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Data standardization is an important but complex process in data science. It involves transforming heterogeneous data formats within a column into a unified format. Traditionally this requires manually writing intricate Pandas code which is inefficient. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language conversations. However, this still requires significant human effort for prompt crafting and refinement.

Proposed Solution:
The key idea is to design a Python library called Dataprep.Clean with declarative APIs to simplify standardizing column types. For example, clean_date() can standardize dates in one line. Then propose CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM agents to fully automate data standardization. It allows users to provide requirements only once for a hands-free process.

Main Contributions:
1) Propose Dataprep.Clean library with 142 unified APIs to reduce complexity of standardizing column types 
2) Propose CleanAgent framework combining Dataprep.Clean and LLM agents to enable automatic end-to-end data standardization
3) Implement CleanAgent as user-friendly web application for demonstration. The implementation is also open-sourced.

In summary, the paper aims to automate the intricate data standardization process by designing a declarative Python library for standardization and integrating it with LLM agents. This simplifies the task for LLM agents and enables a hands-free workflow after initial user requirements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CleanAgent, a framework that automates the data standardization process by leveraging a library of declarative APIs for data cleaning (Dataprep.Clean) and large language model-based agents that can understand requirements, generate code, and execute data transformation pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing Dataprep.Clean, an open-sourced library with declarative, unified APIs specifically designed for standardizing different column types. This simplifies the task of standardizing column types to single line function calls.

2. Proposing CleanAgent, a framework that automates the data standardization process by combining Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents. CleanAgent allows data scientists to provide their requirements just once for a hands-free, automatic standardization process. 

3. Implementing CleanAgent as a user-friendly web application to demonstrate its utility in practice. The web app allows VLDB attendees to interact with CleanAgent using real-world datasets.

In summary, the key ideas are to design a simplified library for standardization (Dataprep.Clean) and integrate it with LLM-based agents (CleanAgent) to fully automate the data standardization process with minimal human involvement. The web application then allows attendees to visualize CleanAgent in action.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a unified API design for data standardization. What were the key principles and considerations when designing these APIs? How does the API design reduce complexity compared to using raw Pandas code?

2. The CleanAgent framework relies on cooperation between multiple agents. Explain the roles of each agent and how they work together to complete the data standardization process. What are the benefits of this cooperative approach?  

3. The Chat Manager agent has a uniquely comprehensive memory. Why is this an important component? How does it facilitate communication and coordination between the other agents?

4. Dataprep.Clean offers 142 standardization functions covering 142 data types. How were these data types and functions identified? What provisions are made for extending support to new data types?

5. The paper identifies 3 common steps for data standardization - split, validate and transform. How are these steps encapsulated within the standardization functions in Dataprep.Clean? Provide examples.

6. What techniques does the Column Type Annotator leverage to identify column types? How does it deal with uncertainty in recognizing column types?

7. Explain how the Python Programmer agent generates code for data standardization. What declarative APIs does it leverage and how does it pick appropriate standardization functions? 

8. The paper emphasizes minimising human involvement. Other than initial requirements, what provisions support iterative refinement of requirements? How are new requirements incorporated?

9. The CleanAgent is deployed as a web application. What motivated this choice? How does the UI support interacting with and monitoring the agent-based workflow?

10. The paper identifies automation of other data science tasks as future work. What capabilities would be required to adapt the agent-based approach to tasks like data cleaning and visualization? What are key challenges?
