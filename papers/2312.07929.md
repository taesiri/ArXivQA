# [Robust and Performance Incentivizing Algorithms for Multi-Armed Bandits   with Strategic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07929)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies a multi-armed bandit problem where the arms are strategic agents who can modify the rewards they provide. Specifically, each arm is an agent with an intrinsic reward distribution. When pulled, an agent samples a reward and can then add deterministic effort to increase the reward or absorb part of the reward to decrease it before passing it to the principal. Agents aim to balance being pulled often while minimizing effort costs. There is a subset of honest agents who never degrade rewards. The principal wants to design a mechanism to incentivize top performance from agents in equilibrium while being robust to non-equilibrium behavior. Key results show that algorithms satisfying "sharp adaptivity" give robustness. Further properties of "monotonicity" and "fairness among top arms" yield "performance incentivizing" algorithms that provide high revenue at equilibrium. Interesting findings are that UCB and Îµ-greedy algorithms have these desired properties. The work also handles settings where agents have limited knowledge. Overall, the paper makes solid contributions in analyzing strategic behavior in multi-armed bandits.
