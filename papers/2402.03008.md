## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating samples from complex multi-modal distributions is an important unsolved problem with applications across machine learning, statistics, and scientific domains like molecular dynamics. Conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods like Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo struggle to effectively explore distributions with disconnected, isolated modes. This inadequate mixing presents a major practical challenge for tasks that rely on sampling from multi-modal densities.

Method: 
The paper proposes Diffusive Gibbs Sampling (DiGS), an innovative family of MCMC sampling algorithms designed for improved exploration of multi-modal densities. DiGS has two key components:

1) Gaussian convolution between the original variable space and a noisy variable space. This bridges isolated modes to facilitate transitions. 

2) Alternating Gibbs sampling between the original space and the convolved noisy space. This allows leveraging tractable conditionals for sampling.

Together, these components enable traversing disconnected modes in the target distribution. The method enhances mixing by incorporating recent advances in score-based generative modeling into the framework of auxiliary variable MCMC.

Contributions:
- Introduces DiGS, a new sampling algorithm with superior performance in multi-modal distributions over state-of-the-art baselines.

- Establishes desirable theoretical properties of the sampler: irreducibility and recurrence.

- Analyzes relationships to related methods like tempering, diffusion models, and reverse diffusion Monte Carlo.

- Empirically demonstrates sizable improvements across tasks (mixture models, Bayesian neural nets) and domains (molecular dynamics) over competitive baselines.

The proposed DiGS method significantly advances the capability to effectively sample from complex multi-modal distributions with widespread applications. Both the theoretical analysis and extensive experiments highlight the promise of this new family of MCMC algorithms.
