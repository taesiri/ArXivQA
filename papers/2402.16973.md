# [Successfully Guiding Humans with Imperfect Instructions by Highlighting   Potential Errors and Suggesting Corrections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models still have imperfections and make mistakes, especially when faced with unfamiliar situations. How can we transform imperfect language models into safe and useful tools to guide human decision-making? Specifically, the paper looks at a grounded navigation task where an instruction generation model produces directions that sometimes contain hallucinations (imagined objects/directions).

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces HEAR, an integrated system to enable humans to navigate more successfully using imperfect instructions. HEAR has two components:

1) Models to detect potential hallucinations in instructions and suggest corrections. This includes a hallucination detection model to identify hallucinated phrases, and a hallucination type model to determine if they should be deleted or replaced. The models are trained via contrastive learning on synthetic data.

2) An intuitive interface to present information to users. It highlights potential hallucinations and shows the top few correction suggestions when clicked.

Main Contributions:
- Shows that highlighting hallucinations helps humans avoid being misled, improving navigation success rate by 6.7% and reducing error distance by 1.9 meters. Providing correction suggestions leads to further gains.

- The system incentivizes humans to put in more effort, as seen by increased use of the "check" button by 29% on average.

- Demonstrates the promise of integrating diverse communication capabilities into AI systems to compensate for model limitations and better aid human decision-making.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to transform an imperfect instruction generation model into a more useful tool for guiding humans by detecting its hallucinations and suggesting remedies through an intuitive interface. The integrated system leads to significant improvements in human navigation performance.
