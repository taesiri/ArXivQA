# [Efficient Collision Detection Oriented Motion Primitives for Path   Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Mobile robots operating in dynamic environments need to replan their paths frequently to avoid collisions. Potential field methods are fast but get stuck in local minima, while sampling-based methods are more robust but computationally expensive. Specifically, checking for collisions along a path requires sampling the robot's position at multiple points, with computation time scaling with path length and sampling resolution. This makes online replanning computationally challenging. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using biarc motion primitives that enable efficient analytical collision detection without needing to sample the entire trajectory. Biarcs comprise two tangent continuous circular arc segments joined at a joint point. By strategic choice of this joint point, smooth trajectories with low curvature discontinuity are obtained. Closed-form computations are derived to check for collisions between the robot's polygonal hitbox following a biarc trajectory and different obstacle types like points, lines and polygons. This avoids iterative computations for sampling collision checks along the path.

For replanning during robot navigation, a heuristic is introduced to select biarcs that maintain proximity to previously planned trajectories, avoiding jerky movements. A* search on a lattice of such biarc connections is used for online planning. Computational efficiency is further improved by reusing prior search efforts when possible.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of biarc geometry, specifically choice of joint point, to simultaneously optimize for path smoothness and length 
- Efficient closed-form computations for checking collisions between biarc robot trajectories and different obstacle types  
- Heuristic biarc selection method for replanning to avoid sudden trajectory changes
- Demonstration of computational speedups of over 100x through biarc lattice planning in simulation benchmarking, with performance comparable to standard ROS planners

In summary, the paper introduces biarc motion primitives to enable fast, analytical collision detection during online replanning, making efficient path planning possible even on computationally limited robots.
