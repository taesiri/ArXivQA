# [Efficient Collision Detection Oriented Motion Primitives for Path   Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01583)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes using biarcs, comprising two circular arcs smoothly joined at a joint point, as motion primitives for path planning to enable efficient collision detection. It analyzes how the choice of joint point impacts path length and curvature continuity, identifying the equal-chord biarc as an optimal compromise. For replanning scenarios, a heuristic is introduced to select a joint point that maintains proximity to the previous trajectory. Closed-form computations are derived to detect collisions between a polygonal robot hitbox moving along a biarc path and common obstacles like points, lines and polygons. Experiments using a conformal lattice planner with biarc motion primitives demonstrate two orders of magnitude faster planning times compared to common ROS planners, with comparable goal reaching times. Key limitations like lack of accounting for minimum obstacle distance and unsuitability for vehicles with Ackermann steering are noted. Overall, the strategic choice of computationally inexpensive biarc motion primitives is shown to significantly accelerate online path planning while retaining solution quality.
