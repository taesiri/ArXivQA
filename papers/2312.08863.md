## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D head models, including hair, from monocular dynamic video sequences. The key idea is to use a prior-guided dynamic implicit neural network framework that leverages both input video frames and extracted priors for robust reconstruction. Specifically, two main priors are utilized: a coarse head model fitted to each frame to provide structure and depth initialization, and semantic segmentation to constrain output geometry. To model non-rigid deformations, a two-part dynamic deformation field is designed to register frames to a canonical space. An implicit neural representation as a signed distance function then reconstructs the canonical geometry via differentiable volumetric rendering. With guidance from the photometric consistency loss, contour consistency loss, prior-based losses, and regularization losses, high-fidelity head models are extracted per-frame. Comparisons show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reconstructed geometric accuracy. Additional results demonstrate robust performance on diverse input videos and the capability for facial reenactment applications.
