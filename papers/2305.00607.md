# [Boosting Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization with Text   Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00607)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper tries to address is: 

How to leverage text information in action category labels to boost weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) and obtain more accurate localization results?

The key points are:

- Current WTAL methods only use video information for training classifiers, while ignoring the text information in action category labels. 

- This paper proposes to leverage text information in two aspects: 1) Text-Segment Mining (TSM) for discriminative objective to enlarge inter-class differences; 2) Video-Text Language Completion (VLC) for generative objective to enhance intra-class integrity.

- TSM treats text queries as experts to match related segments while filtering irrelevant ones. VLC focuses on related segments to complete masked text. 

- Combining TSM and VLC with a self-supervised constraint, the method achieves new state-of-the-art results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets.

- The proposed method can also improve existing WTAL methods by integrating TSM and VLC objectives.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that leveraging text information in labels can boost weakly-supervised temporal action localization, which is validated through the proposed TSM and VLC objectives as well as experiments.
