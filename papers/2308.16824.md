# Can Programming Languages Boost Each Other via Instruction Tuning?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question seems to be:Can programming languages boost each other's performance during the instruction fine-tuning phase of code language models? The authors explore whether training a code language model (like StarCoder) on one programming language can improve its performance on other languages during instruction tuning. Their central hypothesis is that programming languages share inherent similarities and can mutually reinforce each other when used for instruction fine-tuning of large language models. The key experiment tests whether a StarCoder model trained on data from one language (like Python) shows improved code generation ability on another language (like Java) after instruction tuning.In summary, the central research question is whether programming languages can boost each other via instruction tuning of code language models, based on the hypothesis that languages share commonalities that allow for mutual reinforcement during this training process. The authors test this through empirical experiments fine-tuning StarCoder on various languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is exploring whether different programming languages can boost each other during the instruction fine-tuning phase of code large language models (LLMs). Specifically:- The paper trains StarCoder models on monolingual datasets of 8 programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, HTML) using instruction tuning. - Through extensive experiments on HumanEval benchmarks, the paper shows that models fine-tuned on one language significantly improve performance on other languages compared to the base StarCoder model. For example, CodeM-Python trained on Python improves Java by 14.03% absolute pass@1. - The paper provides insights into the correlations and transferability between programming languages. Languages more similar in syntax and design (like C/C++ and JavaScript/TypeScript) tend to boost each other more. - The findings suggest the improvement is mainly due to instruction tuning unlocking inherent capabilities of the model like language understanding, rather than just incorporating new knowledge.In summary, the key contribution is providing empirical evidence that programming languages can mutually boost each other during instruction tuning of code LLMs, highlighting their inherent interconnectivity. The paper also releases the training data to enable further research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper explores whether different programming languages can enhance each other's code generation performance when used to fine-tune large language models via instruction tuning. The key finding is that training on one programming language significantly boosts performance on other languages, suggesting inherent interconnectedness among programming languages.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on code generation models:- The key novelty is exploring whether different programming languages can boost each other during instruction tuning of large language models. Most prior work has focused on pre-training and fine-tuning models on monolingual corpora. This paper provides initial evidence that multilingual transfer can be beneficial.- The scale is quite large - they train 7B and 15B parameter models using the StarCoder architecture. This is comparable to other recent state-of-the-art code generation models like Codex, AlphaCode, and CodeGen in terms of model size.- The training data and experimental methodology follow recent practices in this field. They test on the HumanEval benchmark adapted for multiple languages, and use greedy decoding with pass@1 accuracy as the evaluation metric.- Compared to concurrent work like CodeGen-Multi and StarCoder-base which also train on multilingual corpora, this paper takes a different approach of monolingual pre-training followed by multilingual transfer. The results seem to indicate this is an effective technique.- An interesting finding is that even training on HTML data, which is very different from programming languages, can boost performance on Java code generation. This suggests the improvements may be from general linguistic skills rather than just programming language-specific knowledge transfer.- One limitation is that they only test on a subset of languages available in HumanEval. It would be interesting to see experiments on a wider range of programming languages. Overall, it's an incremental advance building on recent techniques like instruction tuning, with a novel focus on exploring multilingual transfer learning. The results look promising and could open up future work on better leveraging multilingual data for code generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Delve deeper into the reasons why multiple programming languages can enhance each other during instruction tuning. The paper shows empirically that this enhancement occurs, but does not provide insights into the underlying mechanisms.- Explore how to leverage the findings to improve code generation capabilities for less common or new programming languages by training on data from more popular languages. The paper suggests this could be a promising direction.- Construct a unified multilingual dataset covering diverse programming languages for instruction tuning. The paper shows promise in using a small mixed dataset, indicating value in a larger unified dataset. - Examine whether the universal programming language representations learned during pre-training aid the cross-lingual transfer observed during instruction tuning.- Analyze the similarity and differences between programming languages through the lens of instruction tuning improvements. The correlation analysis provides a starting point that could be expanded.- Study whether instruction tuning on multiple languages jointly can yield further improvements compared to separate tuning.- Explore whether the improvements from instruction tuning transfer to other code generation tasks beyond the HumanEval benchmark used in the paper.In summary, the main future directions center on better understanding the transferability between programming languages observed, leveraging it to improve code generation for new languages, constructing unified multilingual datasets, and expanding the analysis and tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores whether different programming languages can boost each other's performance during the instruction fine-tuning phase of code language models. The authors train variants of StarCoder on monolingual corpora of 8 programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, HTML) using instruction tuning. They test the performance of each fine-tuned model on downstream tasks in multiple languages using the HumanEval benchmark. The results show that training on one language significantly improves performance on other languages compared to the base StarCoder model. For example, a model trained only on Python improves Java performance by 14.03% in accuracy. More surprisingly, the HTML model boosts Java performance by 15.24%. This suggests inherent commonalities between programming languages that allow transfer of capabilities from instruction tuning. The authors analyze correlations between language improvements, finding relationships like C/C++ and JavaScript/TypeScript boosting each other more due to syntactic similarities. Overall, the findings reveal the potential for monolingual instruction tuning to improve multilingual code generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper explores whether different programming languages can boost each other's performance during the instruction fine-tuning phase of code language models. The authors train StarCoder models on monolingual datasets for 8 programming languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, and HTML. They find that training on one language significantly improves performance on other languages compared to just training on the base StarCoder model. For example, a Python-trained model improves Java performance by 14.03% in accuracy, while surprisingly an HTML-trained model improves Java by 15.24%. The authors also train a model on a mixed dataset of all 8 languages, and find it achieves the best overall performance across languages. The key conclusions are: 1) Programming languages can significantly enhance each other via instruction tuning, showing their inherent interconnectedness. 2) The degree of improvement correlates with language similarity - e.g. C and C++ boost each other more than Python and C++. 3) A mixed language training set yields the best overall multilingual performance. The findings reveal commonalities among programming languages and their potential for cross-pollination. This could help improve performance on less common languages by pre-training on popular ones. Future work will further analyze the reasons for cross-language benefits.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper explores whether different programming languages can boost each other's performance during the instruction fine-tuning phase of code large language models (LLMs). The authors select 8 popular programming languages - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, and HTML - and construct separate training datasets containing around 9K instruction-code pairs for each language. They then fine-tune the 7B parameter StarCoder model on each of these monolingual datasets using an instruction tuning technique. The fine-tuned models, termed CodeM, are evaluated on multilingual test sets to analyze if training on one language can improve performance on other languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements - for example, CodeM-Python trained solely on Python improves Java test performance by 14.03% absolute pass@1. The authors also find that the degree of improvement correlates with language similarities. These results highlight the transferability between programming languages and their potential to mutually boost each other via instruction tuning of LLMs.
