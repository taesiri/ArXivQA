# [Re-Examine Distantly Supervised NER: A New Benchmark and a Simple   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper examines the task of distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER), where knowledge bases are used to automatically annotate training data instead of expensive manual annotations. However, this introduces label noise issues like false positives and false negatives.
- The authors test existing DS-NER methods on a new real-world dataset called QTL from the animal science domain, and find most methods have unsatisfactory performance, highlighting limitations in practical settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a simple yet effective token-level curriculum learning method called CuPUL to improve model robustness to label noise in DS-NER. 
- CuPUL strategically sequences the training data from "easy" to "hard" tokens. Easy tokens that most basic models agree on are likely less noisy and used for initial training.
- Token difficulty scores are estimated by disagreements between multiple basic NER voter models. An easy-to-hard curriculum schedule is designed using the scores.
- CuPUL also uses confidence-based positive-unlabeled learning to deal with false negatives.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces new real-world QTL benchmark for DS-NER and shows limitations of existing methods on it
- Proposes Curriculum-based Positive-Unlabeled Learning (CuPUL) method to improve DS-NER robustness to label noise using token-level curriculum learning
- Empirically demonstrates CuPUL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on QTL benchmark as well as on several existing datasets
- Simple and effective way to apply curriculum learning to enhance DS-NER systems
