# [Structured Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Few-Shot Generation of   Content-Grounded QA Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating multi-turn questions-answer conversations grounded in a document using large language models (LLMs) is challenging as LLMs often hallucinate content not present in the document. 
- Reducing such "closed-domain" hallucinations in grounded dialog generation is an important problem.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a structured chain-of-thought (SCOT) prompting approach that breaks down the complex task into multiple states in a state machine. 
- Different states focus on subtasks like reading the document, determining answerability of questions, selecting relevant sentences, and generating responses.
- Each state uses specialized prompts and models like instruction-tuned assistants to augment the LLM. This controls the LLM's behavior better.
- Multiple algorithms with different state transitions are proposed. Some transit through an answerability classification state to reduce hallucinations.

Main Contributions:
- A structured prompting framework with modular subtask execution through states to generate grounded conversations.
- Intrinsic evaluation shows reduced hallucination and increased faithfulness to documents from proposed augmentations.
- Conversations synthesized from just 6 seed examples enable strong extrinsic evaluation performance in few-shot and supervised fine-tuning setups.
- Augmenting downstream conversational QA training data with synthesized conversations substantially boosts performance over just using gold data.

In summary, the paper presents a structured augmentation approach for grounded dialog generation using LLMs that demonstrably reduces hallucination and can augment existing data.
