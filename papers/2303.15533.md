# [Sequential training of GANs against GAN-classifiers reveals correlated   "knowledge gaps" present among independently trained GAN instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15533)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Do independently trained instances of the same GAN architecture exhibit correlated "knowledge gaps" (i.e. consistent artifacts across samples) that can be exploited by GAN classifiers? And how do the knowledge gaps change when the GANs are iteratively trained to fool the classifiers?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- GAN classifiers can generalize to new GAN instances, implying consistent knowledge gaps across GAN instances.

- Iteratively training GANs to fool classifiers will reveal new insights into the optimization process and artifact spaces of GANs. 

- The architecture of the classifier impacts the subset of artifacts it learns to exploit.

So in summary, the paper investigates the existence, consistency, and evolution of knowledge gaps in GANs when iteratively trained against GAN classifiers. The goal is to better understand the underlying artifact spaces and optimization dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be studying the phenomenon of "knowledge gaps" in GANs, which refer to artifacts or distinguishing features that are consistently present across samples from a GAN generator. 

Specifically, the authors investigate how iteratively training GANs against classifiers that detect their artifacts affects the GAN training dynamics and image quality. They do this for two settings - a small DCGAN model on MNIST, and the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2 model on FFHQ faces. 

The key findings are:

- Classifiers can generalize to new GAN instances if trained on multiple generators, indicating correlated knowledge gaps. 

- DCGAN struggles to fool classifiers without compromising image quality.

- StyleGAN2 can fool classifiers without affecting image quality, revealing an ordering of optima in the generator parameter space.

- The architecture of the classifier impacts which artifacts it learns to exploit. 

- Iteratively training GANs and classifiers reveals that StyleGAN2 generators shift their knowledge gaps consistently across instances when having to fool new classifiers.

So in summary, the main contribution is providing new insights into the phenomenon of knowledge gaps in GANs, how they are correlated across instances, and how iteratively training against classifiers affects them. The findings highlight the complex interactions between GAN generators and classifiers.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:

The paper shows that GANs trained sequentially to fool classifiers exhibit correlated "knowledge gaps" or artifacts across independently trained instances, suggesting an induced ordering over the space of artifacts GANs can generate.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on detecting and analyzing GAN-generated images:

- It focuses on studying the phenomenon of "knowledge gaps" or consistent artifacts present across samples from independently trained GANs. Previous works have studied detecting GAN images, but don't specifically analyze these shared artifacts across GAN instances.

- It investigates how sequentially training GANs and GAN-detectors against each other affects the artifacts learned, training dynamics, and output quality over multiple iterations. This provides interesting insights into the optimization process of GANs. Most other works only look at training detectors on fixed GAN samples.

- It studies the effects of different classifier architectures on the subset of artifacts learned. Finding that higher capacity classifiers learn more complete artifact spaces. Other works typically use a single classifier architecture. 

- It shows StyleGAN2 can modify artifacts without compromising image quality when trained to fool detectors. Whereas a weaker DCGAN model struggles to do this. Comparisons between different GAN architectures are not extensively explored before.

- It reveals clusters of "mutually fooling" artifacts that consistently emerge in MobileNet classifiers, likely due to limited capacity. The impact of detector capacity on artifacts learned does not seem to be studied much previously.

Overall, this paper provides useful new insights into the spaces of artifacts learned by GANs, the effects of different loss functions and detector architectures, and the ability of state-of-the-art GANs like StyleGAN2 to modify these artifacts over multiple generations. The findings help advance knowledge around detecting and understanding GAN-generated images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Verify if the findings on consistent and correlated "artifact spaces" across independent generator instances generalize to other GAN architectures and datasets beyond StyleGAN2 and FFHQ. The authors suggest it would be instructive to study the overlap in artifact spaces across different GAN architectures over multiple rounds of training.

- Further investigate the ordering or induced preference over artifact spaces that seems to exist when training StyleGAN2 generators over multiple iterations. The authors state this is an interesting phenomenon that merits more study. 

- Look into whether the decorrelation of artifact spaces in StyleGAN2 generators starts happening after a sufficient number of training iterations. The results hint at this possibility.

- Continue research from a misinformation mitigation perspective into better detection of GAN-generated images, given the findings on consistent artifacts. However, also be mindful of potential misuse.

- Study the effect of classifier model architecture and capacity on the specific artifacts learned during training. The results indicate the architecture strongly influences the artifacts captured. Lower capacity classifiers may only learn a subset of available artifacts.

- Explore techniques to automatically eliminate or transform generator artifacts to make GAN outputs more indistinguishable from real data.

- Investigate similarities and differences in the artifact spaces learned by classifiers across various GAN architectures.

So in summary, the authors call for more research into the nature and structure of the artifact spaces produced by GANs, how to mitigate or control them, and how factors like model architecture impact what is learned.
