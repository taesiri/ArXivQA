# [LiSTA: Geometric Object-Based Change Detection in Cluttered Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02175)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Detecting changes in semi-static environments between robotic inspection missions is an important capability for applications like infrastructure monitoring, construction tracking, disaster response, etc. While 3D LiDAR mapping systems have matured recently, automatically detecting object-level changes from sequential incomplete LiDAR observations of the same scene remains challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents LiSTA (LiDAR Spatio-Temporal Analysis), a complete pipeline for probabilistic object-level change detection using multi-mission LiDAR SLAM. The key ideas are:

1) Perform multi-mission pose graph SLAM to align point clouds from different missions into a common frame for change detection. Uses inter-mission loop closures for robustness. 

2) Represent environment as octree and difference octrees from different missions to detect change at a voxel level. 

3) Segment change point clouds into object clusters using Euclidean clustering. Refine using custom merge/split criteria.

4) Describe each object with a learned SE(3) invariant descriptor and cluster descriptors across missions to establish correspondences, without needing pre-training on specific objects.

5) Provide confidence scores for clustering based on descriptor density to handle uncertainty in correspondence.

Main Contributions:

- First holistic object-level LiDAR change detection system combining multi-mission SLAM, advanced 3D data representation, segmentation and deep learning techniques.

- Method to detect repositioned objects without requiring pre-training on a closed set of objects, useful for unconstrained environments.

- Confidence metric and match matrix to quantify uncertainty in correspondence grouping. 

- New multi-mission simulated dataset for change detection research.

- Demonstrated system on a real robot inspecting an industrial site and showed superior performance over existing methods.
