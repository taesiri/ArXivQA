# [Autoregressive Score Generation for Multi-trait Essay Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08332)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing automated essay scoring (AES) models using BERT have shown promising results for holistic (single overall) scoring, but have not been explored for multi-trait scoring (evaluating essays on diverse rubrics). This is likely due to the inefficiency of replicating BERT models for each trait. 
- Current multi-trait scoring approaches mostly employ holistic scoring models, failing to capture trait dependencies. Also, building separate trait-specific modules is resource intensive.
- There is a need for an optimized multi-trait scoring approach that is efficient and captures relationships between trait scores.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an autoregressive multi-trait scoring method called ArTS that leverages the pre-trained T5 model with both encoder and decoder. 
- Unlike treating scoring as regression/classification, ArTS views it as a sequence generation task to output a text sequence containing predicted scores and trait names.
- It employs causal self-attention in decoding to capture intrinsic trait relationships by sequentially predicting scores in an order from rare to frequently assessed traits. 
- Subsequent trait predictions can benefit from previously predicted scores. Only a single model needed for all traits.

Main Contributions:
- ArTS outperforms previous baselines by over 5% in average trait scores on ASAP and ASAP++ datasets, using a single model for efficiency.
- Ablations and trait order experiments verify the approach. Additional experiments on the Feedback Prize dataset demonstrate wider applicability.
- The work proposes a new perspective on AES as an autoregressive text generation task instead of classification/regression.
- It shows promise in using the decoder capacities of pre-trained models for multi-trait scoring versus sole reliance on encoder.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient automated multi-trait essay scoring method using causal decoding with T5, outperforming previous approaches while requiring only a single model. It provides a new viewpoint of generating an entire score sequence in an autoregressive text-to-text framework.
