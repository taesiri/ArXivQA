# [Uncertainty-Aware Optimal Transport for Semantically Coherent   Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10449)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we improve out-of-distribution detection by more effectively utilizing unlabeled data containing a mix of in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Leveraging energy-based guidance and optimal transport can help assign semantic labels to unlabeled in-distribution data, allowing models to better learn the distinction between in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples.

In summary, the paper focuses on semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection with mixed unlabeled data, proposing an uncertainty-aware optimal transport scheme to assign labels and discriminate between in-distribution vs out-of-distribution data based on an energy score. The core goal is improving OOD detection through better use of unlabeled data.
