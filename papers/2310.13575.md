# [Semantic Decomposition of Question and SQL for Text-to-SQL Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13575)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-SQL semantic parsing faces challenges in generalizing to complex, cross-domain queries. Performance drops from 90%+ on simple queries to around 50% on complex ones.
- Existing datasets lack question decomposition annotations to help parse complex queries. 
- SQL syntax complexity makes it hard to disentangle complex queries into simpler standalone components.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new Query Plan Language (QPL) that modularly decomposes SQL queries into simple, regular sub-queries based on the database query execution plan.
- Develop a method to automatically translate SQL queries into semantically equivalent QPL plans.
- Enrich Spider dataset with QPL annotations and question decompositions grounded in QPL structure. 

Main Contributions:
1) Definition of QPL language with tools to translate SQL to QPL and execute QPL on SQL servers.
2) Spider-QPL dataset augmenting Spider with QPL plans and schema-based question decompositions.  
3) Text-to-QPL models outperforming Text-to-SQL baselines, especially on complex queries.
4) User study showing non-experts can better detect incorrect complex queries in QPL vs SQL.

Key Benefits:
- QPL is more interpretable for non-experts on complex queries.  
- Modular nature of QPL benefits existing semantic parsing models.
- QPL plans can be decomposed into simpler questions, enabling question decomposition methods.

Limitations:
- Only tested on Spider dataset QPLs up to 13 lines long.
- Models trained without full database schema and content information.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed QPL solution, main experimental results, contributions, benefits and limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new modular Query Plan Language (QPL) derived from SQL query execution plans to enhance complex text-to-SQL parsing through improved compositionality and interpretability compared to generating SQL directly.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) The introduction of the Query Plan Language (QPL), which is a modular, decomposable intermediary language for representing the semantics of SQL queries. The paper describes the design of QPL, a method for automatically translating SQL queries into QPL plans, and executing QPL on SQL servers.

2) The creation of the Spider-QPL dataset, which enriches the existing Spider text-to-SQL dataset with semantically equivalent QPL programs and question decompositions derived from the QPL structure.

3) Text-to-QPL models which achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models, while being easier to learn for neural architectures. The paper shows improved performance on complex queries.

4) A user experiment demonstrating QPL plans are easier for non-expert users to validate alignment with questions compared to complex SQL queries.

5) Analysis and discussion around using question decomposition based on QPL structure to potentially further improve semantic parsing performance.

In summary, the main innovation seems to be the introduction of the QPL language and showing its benefits over SQL as a target for text-to-code semantic parsing. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

The paper introduces Query Plan Language (QPL) as an intermediary representation between natural language questions and SQL queries. It aims to improve text-to-SQL models' ability to generalize across domains and handle complex queries. Key ideas include: semantically decomposing SQL into modular QPL queries, developing automated SQL-to-QPL conversion, using QPL plans to produce question decompositions, and showing QPL can be more interpretable than SQL. The Spider dataset is used for experiments, assessing text-to-QPL learning and evaluating users' ability to validate query correctness. Overall, the paper explores using semantic modularity and decomposition to improve complex text-to-SQL parsing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new modular, executable query language called Query Plan Language (QPL). What were the key motivations and design principles behind creating this new language instead of using SQL directly?

2. The paper converts SQL queries to QPL by reusing the execution plans from the SQL Server optimizer. What are some potential limitations of basing the QPL representation solely on these execution plans? Could the conversion process be improved?  

3. The QPL language is converted back into executable SQL using Common Table Expressions (CTEs). What are some advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to having native execution support for QPL?

4. The paper proposes a model for mapping natural language questions directly to QPL. What modifications need to be made to existing semantic parsing models to adapt them to this new target representation?

5. The paper also explores an approach that first generates a natural language question decomposition before predicting the QPL. Why does this approach underperform compared to direct question to QPL mapping? How could it be improved?

6. For evaluating model accuracy, executing the QPL and comparing result sets is used. What are some potential issues with using only result set comparison as the evaluation metric? 

7. The paper claims QPL plans are easier for non-experts to interpret over SQL. Is the relatively small scale user study enough to make this conclusion? What additional experiments could be done?

8. The error analysis reveals certain schemas lead to more QPL prediction errors. What could be the reasons for this discrepancy and how can models be made more robust to schema irregularities?  

9. The paper focuses only on the Spider dataset. How do you think the QPL approach would fare on other complex text-to-SQL datasets like WikiSQL or CoSQL? Would the conclusions still hold?

10. The QPL language is positioned as an intermediate step for semantic parsing. Besides improved interpretability, what other potential benefits could leveraging this representation provide for advancing text-to-SQL research?
