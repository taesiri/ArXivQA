# [Semantic Decomposition of Question and SQL for Text-to-SQL Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13575)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text-to-SQL semantic parsing faces challenges in generalizing to complex, cross-domain queries. Performance drops from 90%+ on simple queries to around 50% on complex ones.
- Existing datasets lack question decomposition annotations to help parse complex queries. 
- SQL syntax complexity makes it hard to disentangle complex queries into simpler standalone components.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new Query Plan Language (QPL) that modularly decomposes SQL queries into simple, regular sub-queries based on the database query execution plan.
- Develop a method to automatically translate SQL queries into semantically equivalent QPL plans.
- Enrich Spider dataset with QPL annotations and question decompositions grounded in QPL structure. 

Main Contributions:
1) Definition of QPL language with tools to translate SQL to QPL and execute QPL on SQL servers.
2) Spider-QPL dataset augmenting Spider with QPL plans and schema-based question decompositions.  
3) Text-to-QPL models outperforming Text-to-SQL baselines, especially on complex queries.
4) User study showing non-experts can better detect incorrect complex queries in QPL vs SQL.

Key Benefits:
- QPL is more interpretable for non-experts on complex queries.  
- Modular nature of QPL benefits existing semantic parsing models.
- QPL plans can be decomposed into simpler questions, enabling question decomposition methods.

Limitations:
- Only tested on Spider dataset QPLs up to 13 lines long.
- Models trained without full database schema and content information.

The summary covers the key details on the problem, proposed QPL solution, main experimental results, contributions, benefits and limitations.
