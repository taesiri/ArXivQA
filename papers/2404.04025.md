# [Framework to generate perfusion map from CT and CTA images in patients   with acute ischemic stroke: A longitudinal and cross-sectional study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death globally. Effective treatment decisions require early vascular imaging to assess blood flow and predict brain infarction. 
- The golden hour after admission is critical for treatment to minimize brain damage.
- 4D CT/MR perfusion imaging (4D-CTP) is ideal for assessing blood flow but is complex, time-consuming, and not routinely available in the first hour. 
- In contrast, plain CT and CT angiography (CTA) are acquired earlier and more widely available.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a framework to generate a predicted perfusion map (PPM) derived only from CT and CTA that could serve as a proxy for 4D-CTP when the latter is unavailable in the first hour.

Methodology:
- The pipeline uses 18 patients with CT, CTA and 4D-CTP and a larger cohort of 2110 patients with CT, CTA and stroke severity scores.
- It digitally subtracts CT from CTA to extract vessels, detects seeds/sources in the vessels, and uses fast marching to estimate first arrival times of blood at each voxel to generate the PPM.

Validation: 
- Longitudinal: High spatial similarity found between PPM and later 4D-CTP derived Tmax maps in 18 patients, independent of age.
- Cross-sectional: PPM lesions correlated to symptoms in expected eloquent areas in 2110 patients.

Conclusion:
- Framework can generate perfusion-like maps from CT/CTA that show strong similarity to actual perfusion maps derived later. Could be a readily available alternative to assess infarction when 4D-CTP unavailable in critically-timed first hour after admission.

Main Contributions:  
1) Novel pipeline to create pseudo-perfusion maps from only CT and CTA
2) Validation against actual 4D-CTP perfusion maps 
3) Demonstrated clinical utility in correlating to symptoms and eloquent areas


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework to generate a predicted perfusion map from routinely acquired CT and CTA scans in acute ischemic stroke patients, validated against gold-standard perfusion maps and shown to correlate with symptoms, to serve as an alternative for assessing blood flow when advanced perfusion imaging is unavailable.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The development and validation of a framework to generate a predicted perfusion map (PPM) from routinely acquired CT and CTA scans in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The PPM serves as an alternative for 4D perfusion imaging to investigate blood perfusion in the first hours after hospital admission, in situations where 4D perfusion imaging is unavailable. The framework is validated by showing high spatial correlation between the PPM and gold standard T-max perfusion maps in 18 patients, as well as correlation between PPM and stroke symptoms using NIHSS scores in a large cohort of 2110 patients. Overall, it provides a practical and validated method to obtain perfusion information without additional scanning or radiation exposure when 4D perfusion imaging cannot be acquired.

In summary, the main contribution is a clinically validated framework to generate a surrogate perfusion map from standard CT/CTA that could guide treatment decisions when advanced perfusion imaging is not feasible.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Predicted perfusion map (PPM) - The perfusion map generated by the authors' proposed framework using CT and CTA images. It is compared against the T-max map from 4D-CTP.

- 4D-CTP - 4-dimensional CT perfusion imaging, which is commonly used to investigate blood flow but has limitations in availability early after stroke admission. 

- T-max - A perfusion parameter from 4D-CTP representing the time for contrast to reach each voxel. Used to predict infarction regions.

- Spatial similarity - The analysis done using Spearman's rank correlation to compare the PPM and T-max maps spatially.

- NIHSS - National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, a standardized assessment of stroke severity and symptoms. Scores correlated with regions in the PPM.  

- CT, CTA - CT is plain computed tomography, while CTA is CT angiography. Both are acquired early in stroke care and used to generate the PPM.

- Voxel-wise analysis - Comparing voxels in images across modalities (PPM vs T-max) and relating voxel values to clinical scores.

- Infarction, ischemic core - Key concepts in stroke pathophysiology that perfusion imaging aims to identify.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a fast marching algorithm to estimate the time-of-arrival at each voxel. Can you explain in more detail how this algorithm works and how it is suited to estimating perfusion time? 

2. Seed points were extracted from the skeleton of the vascular contrast enhanced DSA image. What were the criteria used to select these seed points along the skeleton? How does selecting seeds in this way impact the final perfusion estimation?

3. What is the motivation behind using a Perona-Malik filter to process the DSA image before extracting the vascular skeleton? How does this anisotropic diffusion filtering impact later steps? 

4. The predicted perfusion map (PPM) is said to be constrained by physical and geometrical properties. Can you elaborate on what specific physical and geometrical constraints were used in generating the PPM?

5. Spearman's rank correlation was used to compare the PPM to the gold standard Tmax maps. Why was Spearman's chosen over Pearson correlation given that both PPM and Tmax are continuous measures?

6. It is mentioned that age did not significantly correlate with the similarity between PPM and Tmax. Why is independence from age an important characteristic for the proposed method? 

7. The paper validates the PPM using longitudinal analysis on 18 subjects and cross-sectional analysis on 2110 subjects. Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two validation approaches.

8. For the cohort of 2110 subjects, the PPM is correlated with NIHSS stroke symptoms scores. Discuss how predictive mapping neurological symptoms aids in evaluating and localizing vascular lesions. 

9. The computation of the PPM relies only on CT and CTA and does not require specialized 4D perfusion software. How could this improve the clinical accessibility and adoption of cerebrovascular perfusion mapping?  

10. The paper states the PPM provides an estimation of perfusion time but does not directly quantify blood flow. How might the method be extended to produce additional hemodynamic parameters?
