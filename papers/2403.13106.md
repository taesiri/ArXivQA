# [Knowing Your Nonlinearities: Shapley Interactions Reveal the Underlying   Structure of Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13106)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modern neural networks exhibit complex non-linear behaviors that are difficult to interpret. The commonly used Shapley values for model interpretation rely on a linearity assumption that is invalid for neural networks.

- Shapley interaction values can quantify the degree of non-linear interaction among features, but calculating them exactly is prohibitively expensive. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) to efficiently approximate pairwise feature interactions in neural networks. 

- Apply STII analysis across language, speech and vision models to understand how feature interactions correlate with known linguistic, phonetic and visual structure in the data.

Key Contributions:

- Show MLMs rely more on syntax while ALMs rely more on positional distance for determining feature interactions. MWEs are less compositionally handled in MLMs and distant context ALMs.

- Speech model interactions reflect that vowel acoustics depend heavily on consonant contexts. More vowel-like consonants have higher interactions like vowels do.

- Image classifiers have lower interactions at object boundaries since perturbations blend into edge artifacts. Nearby edge pixels interact most with foreground pixels.

- Demonstrate interpretability benefits from domain knowledge across NLP, speech and vision. Establish feature interactions as a tool for understanding model representations and inductive biases.

In summary, the paper proposes using STII to approximate neural network feature interactions. It shows across three modalities that these interactions correlate with and provide insight into known structure underlying the data. This demonstrates the importance of grounding interpretability in domain expertise.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper uses Shapley interaction indices across modalities like language, speech, and vision to illustrate how interpreting complex neural network representations benefits from incorporating knowledge of the underlying structure in the data, whether syntactic, phonological, or perceptual.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is using Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) to analyze the impact of underlying data structure on model representations across different modalities, tasks, and architectures. Specifically, the paper looks at linguistic structure in language models, phonetic structure in speech models, and visual structure like edges and backgrounds in image classifiers. The key findings are:

- MLMs exhibit interactions that correlate with syntactic distance, while this is less true for ALMs. Both interact more within idiomatic expressions. This suggests MLMs learn more hierarchical structure.  

- Speech models show higher interaction of acoustic features around vowel-consonant transitions compared to consonant-consonant, matching phonology that says vowels depend more on context. More vowel-like consonants also interact more across phoneme boundaries.

- Image classifiers show lower local interaction near edges since perturbations just blend into compression artifacts. Edges interact more with nearby foreground pixels than other nearby pixels, but interactions become uniform at a distance.

The main contribution is using STII and domain knowledge to characterize how different types of structure in the data affect the learned representations and interactions in neural models across language, speech, and vision tasks. This demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary interpretability work.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper proposes using Shapley Taylor Interaction Indices (STII) to measure feature interactions in neural networks. How does STII build upon prior work in approximating Shapley feature interactions? What are the benefits of using STII over other interaction measures?

2. The paper analyzes feature interactions across modalities like language, speech, and vision. What modifications or adaptations were required to apply STII in these different domains? How does the choice of reference value for feature ablation impact the meaningfulness of interactions? 

3. When analyzing interactions in language models, the paper controls for both the distance between the interacting token pair and the distance to the predicted token. Why is controlling for these positional distances important? How do the interaction trends differ between masked language models and autoregressive language models?

4. The paper finds that tokens within a multiword expression (MWE) have higher interaction in MLMs compared to arbitrary token pairs. Why might MWE tokens interact more strongly, given their non-compositional semantics? Why does this MWE effect seem more consistent for MLMs than ALMs?

5. For speech models, this paper analyzes how vowel and consonant transitions impact local feature interactions. How do the interactions studied here relate to principles from phonology about coarticulation and vowel acoustics? What hypotheses about speech production are reflected in the model's learned feature dependencies?

6. In analyzing a speech model, the paper relies on forced alignments to relate variable-length acoustic features to discretized phonemes. What are potential issues with determining phoneme boundaries from forced alignment? How could errors impact the interaction calculations?

7. When analyzing images, the paper focuses interactions between pixels at object edges. Why might edges have lower local interactions than foreground pixels? What factors might influence interactions between edge pixels and nearby foreground, background, and other edge pixels?  

8. The paper frequently argues that interpretability should leverage domain knowledge and datasets' latent structure. What are some examples where domain knowledge provided insights into the feature interactions learned by models? What types of structure could be explored in future work?

9. The paper focuses on pairwise feature interactions, but recent work has developed approaches to model higher-order interactions between groups of 3 or more features. How could extending this analysis to higher orders provide additional insights into model representations and data structure?

10. What do you see as the most promising directions for future work in this area? What disciplines could contribute useful structural domain knowledge for guiding interpretation? How could insights from analyzing interactions at scale lead to progress in the scientific understanding of natural intelligence?
