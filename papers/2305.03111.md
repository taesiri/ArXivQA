# [Can LLM Already Serve as A Database Interface? A BIg Bench for
  Large-Scale Database Grounded Text-to-SQLs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03111)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT already serve as effective database interfaces for converting natural language questions into executable SQL queries?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Current text-to-SQL models still struggle to generalize to realistic settings with large, noisy database values.

2) Incorporating external knowledge about database contents and reasoning improves model performance. 

3) Optimizing for SQL query efficiency in addition to accuracy is important for practical applications.

The authors motivate the work by arguing that existing text-to-SQL benchmarks focus mostly on schema rather than actual database contents, leaving a gap between research and real-world applications. 

To test their hypotheses, the authors introduce a new benchmark called BIRD that contains natural language questions paired with SQL queries across 95 large real-world databases. BIRD incorporates external knowledge, noisy data values, and metrics for evaluating SQL efficiency.

Experiments on BIRD with models like ChatGPT show much lower performance compared to human annotators, indicating current LLMs still struggle with these more realistic text-to-SQL tasks. The analysis provides evidence that knowledge and efficiency are important challenges for future work.

In summary, the central research question is whether LLMs can serve as effective database interfaces on practical text-to-SQL problems, which these experiments on the new BIRD benchmark indicate is not yet the case. The paper's hypotheses center on knowledge, values, and efficiency as key challenges to address.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing BIRD, a large-scale English text-to-SQL benchmark dataset that focuses on challenges involved in handling real-world large databases. 

Some key aspects of the BIRD benchmark:

- It contains 12,751 text-to-SQL examples over 95 large databases spanning 37 domains and totaling 33.4 GB in size. This makes it significantly larger and more diverse than previous benchmarks.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be introducing a new benchmark dataset called BIRD for evaluating text-to-SQL models. The key problem it is trying to address is the gap between existing academic text-to-SQL benchmarks and real-world applications, especially when it comes to handling large databases with complex schemas and noisy values. 

Specifically, the paper argues that current benchmarks like Spider and WikiSQL focus mostly on database schemas/structure but neglect complex database values. As a result, models trained on these benchmarks struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios with large, messy databases. 

The main questions the paper seems to be exploring are:

- Can current state-of-the-art text-to-SQL models handle realistically large and noisy databases?

- How do these models perform when external knowledge and reasoning is required to map natural language to SQL queries? 

- How can we evaluate and optimize the efficiency of generated SQL queries, not just their accuracy?

To address these questions, the paper introduces the BIRD benchmark containing 12,751 text-to-SQL examples over 95 large databases spanning different domains. It also provides metrics to evaluate SQL accuracy and efficiency, as well as human performance benchmarks. The goal is to promote research into text-to-SQL methods that can work effectively on real-world tasks.

In summary, the key problem is bridging the gap between academic text-to-SQL research and practical applications involving large, complex databases. BIRD aims to support this by providing a more challenging and realistic benchmark.
