# [Can LLM Already Serve as A Database Interface? A BIg Bench for   Large-Scale Database Grounded Text-to-SQLs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03111)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: Can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT already serve as effective database interfaces for converting natural language questions into executable SQL queries?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Current text-to-SQL models still struggle to generalize to realistic settings with large, noisy database values.2) Incorporating external knowledge about database contents and reasoning improves model performance. 3) Optimizing for SQL query efficiency in addition to accuracy is important for practical applications.The authors motivate the work by arguing that existing text-to-SQL benchmarks focus mostly on schema rather than actual database contents, leaving a gap between research and real-world applications. To test their hypotheses, the authors introduce a new benchmark called BIRD that contains natural language questions paired with SQL queries across 95 large real-world databases. BIRD incorporates external knowledge, noisy data values, and metrics for evaluating SQL efficiency.Experiments on BIRD with models like ChatGPT show much lower performance compared to human annotators, indicating current LLMs still struggle with these more realistic text-to-SQL tasks. The analysis provides evidence that knowledge and efficiency are important challenges for future work.In summary, the central research question is whether LLMs can serve as effective database interfaces on practical text-to-SQL problems, which these experiments on the new BIRD benchmark indicate is not yet the case. The paper's hypotheses center on knowledge, values, and efficiency as key challenges to address.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing BIRD, a large-scale English text-to-SQL benchmark dataset that focuses on challenges involved in handling real-world large databases. Some key aspects of the BIRD benchmark:- It contains 12,751 text-to-SQL examples over 95 large databases spanning 37 domains and totaling 33.4 GB in size. This makes it significantly larger and more diverse than previous benchmarks.- The databases have complex schemas and large, noisy content values. This poses new challenges compared to existing benchmarks that focus mainly on schema rather than content.- The examples require reasoning with external knowledge such as numeric operations, domain knowledge, synonyms etc. to correctly map text to SQL queries.- It introduces a new metric called Valid Efficiency Score (VES) to measure not just accuracy but also the efficiency of predicted SQL queries. This is important for practical applications with large databases.- Extensive experiments show current state-of-the-art models still underperform significantly compared to human performance, demonstrating the challenges presented by BIRD. The authors provide detailed error analysis into the remaining difficulties. In summary, BIRD advances text-to-SQL research by providing a more realistic and challenging benchmark that brings academic studies closer to practical applications needing to handle large and noisy real-world databases. The focus on reasoning with external knowledge and optimizing efficiency in addition to accuracy poses new research problems.
