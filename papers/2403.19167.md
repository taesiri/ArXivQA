# [Mitigating Misleading Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Selective   Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19167)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has shown impressive capabilities in language models. However, its efficacy depends on the quality of the reasoning chain. Flawless CoT reasoning is difficult to guarantee due to indecomposable questions and potential for erroneous reasoning chains.

- Smaller language models are more prone to generating flawed reasoning chains, leading to inferior results compared to directly predicting answers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Selective Filtering Reasoner (SelF-Reasoner) which assesses the entailment relationship between the input question and candidate reasoning chain. 

- If the reasoning chain demonstrates confidence, CoT reasoning proceeds. Otherwise, the model directly predicts the answer.

- SelF-Reasoner contains (1) a reasoner to generate candidate chains, (2) an answerer to predict answers directly or extract from question-solution pairs, (3) a CoT Filter to discard invalid reasoning chains.

Main Contributions:

- SelF-Reasoner outperforms fine-tuned CoT/vanilla baselines on ScienceQA, ECQA and LastLetter datasets, showing effectiveness for small language models.

- Analysis on reasoning chain quality and typical mistakes in CoT fine-tuning of language models. 

- Demonstration of a selective filtering mechanism to identify and mitigate misleading chain of thoughts to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

In summary, the proposed SelF-Reasoner successfully creates a highly accurate and interpretable reasoning model by filtering out invalid chain-of-thoughts when necessary. The consistent performance gains validate the significance of selective filtering for fine-tuning language models.
