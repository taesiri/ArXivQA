# [Improving the JPEG-resistance of Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition   by Interpolation Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) models are vulnerable to JPEG compression, which discards high-frequency signals and impairs the effectiveness of adversarial examples. 
- Improving JPEG resistance of adversarial attacks is important to evaluate vulnerabilities in FR systems.
- Prior work has limitations in improving JPEG robustness across varying compression levels.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an Interpolation Attack Method (IAM) to smooth adversarial perturbations and reduce high-frequency signals. 
- IAM downsamples and upsamples the adversarial example using bilinear interpolation during attack iteration. This smoothing makes the attack more JPEG-robust.
- IAM can be flexibly integrated with existing attack methods like BIM, MI, DI, etc.

Main Contributions:
- Analyze impact of varying JPEG quality factors on attack success rates of different FR models.
- Propose IAM for generating JPEG-resistant adversarial examples by interpolation.
- Show IAM improves JPEG robustness of attacks across quality factors and enhances transferability.
- Demonstrate combining IAM with state-of-the-art attacks significantly boosts success rates against normally trained and adversarially trained FR models compared to baseline attacks. 
- Compare with prior JPEG-robust attack JPEG-SS and show comprehensive improvement across quality factors.
- Perform ablation studies on impact of interpolation factors.

In summary, the paper presents an effective interpolated smoothing approach to craft adversarial examples that can maintain high attack success even when undergoing JPEG compression at differing quality levels.
