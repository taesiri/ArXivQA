# [Translating Images to Road Network:A Non-Autoregressive   Sequence-to-Sequence Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Translating Images to Road Network: A Non-Autoregressive Sequence-to-Sequence Approach":

Problem: 
Extracting high-definition road networks from images captured by on-board sensors is essential for autonomous driving, but poses significant challenges. Road networks contain both Euclidean data (e.g. locations of landmarks, shapes of curves) and non-Euclidean data (e.g. connectivity between roads). Existing methods struggle to effectively integrate these two types of data. 

Proposed Solution:
1) Introduce a unified sequence representation called "RoadNet Sequence" that projects both Euclidean and non-Euclidean road network data into a single integer sequence. This representation has merits of losslessness, efficiency, and enabling interaction between the two data domains.

2) Propose an auto-regressive RoadNetworkTransformer (RNTR) that uses a Transformer decoder to generate the RoadNet Sequence from input images in an auto-regressive manner.

3) Further propose a Semi-Autoregressive RNTR that retains auto-regressiveness locally but allows parallel generation globally, improving efficiency.

4) Finally, propose a Non-Autoregressive RNTR that iteratively refines the full sequence in a non-autoregressive manner using masked sequence training, achieving real-time performance.

Main Contributions:
- Novel RoadNet Sequence representation to unify Euclidean and non-Euclidean road network data
- Auto-regressive, semi-autoregressive and non-autoregressive RNTR models to generate road networks
- Significantly improved efficiency and accuracy over previous methods
- Extensive experiments validating superiority on nuScenes dataset

In summary, the paper introduces a unified sequence representation and Transformer-based models to effectively extract road networks from images in an efficient non-autoregressive manner.
