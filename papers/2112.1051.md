# [Magnetic correction to the Anomalous Magnetic Moment of Electron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.1051)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:What is the leading order correction to the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of the electron due to the presence of an external magnetic field?The key points are:- The AMM of the electron, quantified by the g-factor deviation from 2, arises from quantum effects like virtual particle loops that break the chiral symmetry. - An external magnetic field is known to catalytically enhance chiral symmetry breaking via the magnetic catalysis effect. This suggests the magnetic field could induce an extra correction to the electron AMM.- This potential magnetic field dependence of the electron AMM has not been calculated before. The authors aim to compute this correction.- The motivation is two-fold: 1) check how magnetic field changes electron AMM, 2) gain insights into how magnetic field affects quark AMM, which is important for magnetized QCD matter but challenging to calculate directly due to nonperturbative effects.- The authors calculate the leading order magnetic correction to electron AMM using QED Feynman diagrams in a constant external magnetic field. - They find the correction is negative, proportional to the magnetic field strength, and becomes significant when the magnetic field is comparable to the electron mass scale.In summary, the key hypothesis is that an external magnetic field induces a correction to the electron AMM, and the paper aims to compute this magnetically catalyzed correction. The results provide a reference for quark AMM in magnetic fields.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper investigates the leading order correction to the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of the electron due to an external magnetic field. The key findings are:- The magnetic field induces a negative correction to the electron AMM, indicating a magnetic catalysis effect. - The magnetic correction is proportional to m^2, the electron mass squared, suggesting it is a nonperturbative effect arising from dynamical chiral symmetry breaking by the magnetic field.- For laboratory magnetic fields ~1 T, the correction is negligible compared to the measured electron AMM. But for B ~ m_e^2/e ~ 10^13 T, the correction becomes significant.- The magnetic field dependence of the electron AMM provides a reference for estimating the AMM of quarks in strong magnetic fields, which is important for magnetized QCD matter but challenging to calculate directly.- The negative correction causes a slight diamagnetism by suppressing the Zeeman splitting of electron energy levels.In summary, this paper calculates for the first time the leading order magnetic field correction to the electron AMM, revealing its nonperturbative nature and implications for QCD matter and diamagnetism. The methodology could be extended to study other charged fermions in magnetic fields.
