# [Learnable Commutative Monoids for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08541)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we design graph neural network (GNN) aggregation functions that strike a favorable trade-off between expressivity, generalization ability, and computational efficiency?Specifically, the paper investigates whether learnable aggregation functions like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can match or exceed the performance of commonly used fixed aggregation functions like sum, max, and PNA, while also overcoming the limitations of RNNs in terms of parallelizability and training difficulty. To address this, the paper proposes a new class of aggregators called "learnable commutative monoids" (LCMs) which have the flexibility of RNNs but with only O(logV) depth compared to the O(V) depth of RNNs. The key ideas are:- Framing permutation-invariant aggregation as commutative monoids, both for fixed aggregators and potential target functions we want to learn- Observing RNNs are expressive but inefficient due to their sequential nature- Proposing a more efficient tree-based aggregation using learnable, commutative binary operators- Showing LCMs match or exceed RNNs and fixed aggregators on synthetic and real-world graph problemsSo in summary, the central hypothesis is that LCMs can provide a favorable trade-off between expressivity, generalization, and efficiency compared to prior RNN and fixed aggregator approaches for GNNs. The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical evaluation across diverse graph tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces the idea of using learnable commutative monoids (LCMs) as aggregation functions in graph neural networks (GNNs). The main contributions are:- Formalizing GNN aggregation functions as commutative monoids, and showing how using a fixed monoid like sum or max forces the GNN to learn a potentially complex monoid homomorphism. - Proposing recurrent neural network (RNN) based aggregators as a more flexible learnable alternative, but noting their limitations in efficiency due to O(V) sequential depth.- Introducing the idea of learnable commutative monoids, which have an O(log V) depth by using tree-based aggregation, achieving a tradeoff between expressiveness and efficiency.- Empirically demonstrating that LCMs match or exceed the performance of RNN and fixed aggregator baselines on several synthetic and real-world graph learning benchmarks.- Showing that regularizing the LCMs towards commutativity and associativity improves performance and robustness further.Overall, the paper makes a strong case for using learnable commutative monoids as efficient and flexible aggregators for graph neural networks. The key innovation is achieving the expressiveness of RNN aggregators while having logarithmic rather than linear depth.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes learnable commutative monoid (LCM) aggregators for graph neural networks, which provide a favorable trade-off between the expressiveness of recurrent aggregators and the efficiency of fixed aggregators like sum or max.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on graph neural networks and aggregation functions:- The key novelty of this paper is proposing the use of learnable commutative monoids (LCMs) as graph aggregation functions. Previous work has explored learnable aggregation, but mostly using recurrent neural networks. The idea of learning an associative/commutative operator with efficient binary tree aggregation seems new.- This paper clearly explains the theoretical motivation for LCMs - that graph aggregation can be viewed as reducing a multiset under a commutative monoid operation. Framing the problem this way allows them to analyze limitations of existing approaches like fixed aggregators.- The paper backs up the theoretical analysis with thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world graph problems. They show LCMs can outperform fixed/recurrent aggregators in cases where the "true" aggregation monoid is complex.- The idea of constraining/regularizing neural network components to have desired algebraic properties has been explored before in areas like graph networks and attention, but this paper presents a novel application of that concept.- Overall this seems like an incremental but solid step forward - the proposed LCM aggregators offer a favorable tradeoff between expressiveness and efficiency. The ablation studies provide some useful practical insights around regularization and dimensionality.- Compared to state-of-the-art works like PNA the improvements are fairly modest. But the paper makes a strong case that learnable aggregation is an important direction, and the LCM framework seems like a theoretically grounded approach vs. more ad-hoc parameterizations.In summary, this paper moves graph neural network research forward through an elegant application of commutative monoid theory. The results substantiate the benefits of learning to aggregate, rather than relying solely on fixed functions. The proposed LCM aggregators seem promising and this line of work could lead to further improvements.
