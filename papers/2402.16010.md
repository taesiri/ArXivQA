# [Energy-conserving intermittent-contact motion in complex models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16010)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of finding persistent, energy-conserving motions like walking or hopping in mechanical systems that undergo collisions and impacts. Specifically, it looks at motions that are "collisionless", meaning all intermittent contacts with the ground occur at zero velocity so no energy is lost. Prior analytical work on this problem has been limited to simple 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems. The goal is to extend the analysis to more complex, higher DOF systems.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents a general framework for finding collisionless solutions in $N$-DOF linear dynamical systems undergoing one-dimensional impacts. It shows the core equations describing the collisionless motion can be formulated just in terms of the normal mode frequencies of the constrained and unconstrained systems, without needing the full normal mode details. This reveals a simple underlying structure. The formulation enables analysis of the critical region where the solution ceases to exist, indicating a general existence condition requiring the presence of at least one oscillatory mode in the constrained system. Practically, the harmonic solutions provide an initialization for numerically converging to solutions of nonlinear models.

Key Contributions:
- General formulation for collisionless motion extended to $N$-DOF systems, demonstrating the problem can be described solely in terms of normal mode frequencies 
- Analysis of the solution in the critical region and formulation of an existence condition requiring presence of an oscillatory constrained mode
- Method for efficiently finding solutions by plotting impact time equations and numerically solving for curve intersections
- Reproduction of prior 2-DOF solutions as special case and solution of new 3-DOF example demonstrating application

The framework developed enables extending collisionless solutions to more complex models. This can provide insights for understanding efficient locomotion in animals and designing efficient walking machines.
