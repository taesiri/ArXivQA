# [Global Convergence of Natural Policy Gradient with Hessian-aided   Momentum Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01084)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies natural policy gradient (NPG) methods for reinforcement learning. NPG utilizes the Fisher information matrix to precondition the gradient direction. Existing works have studied the convergence and sample complexity of exact NPG methods. However, in practice NPG needs to be estimated from samples, which introduces bias and variance. Therefore, it is important to analyze the convergence and sample complexity of sample-based NPG methods. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new sample-based NPG method called NPG-HM. It uses Hessian-aided momentum variance reduction to reduce the variance of the gradient estimates. Specifically, it constructs an unbiased estimator of the gradient difference using samples from a mixed policy and the integral of the Hessian. This avoids having to use importance sampling weights whose properties are hard to verify. To compute the NPG update direction, it runs stochastic gradient descent on a least squares sub-problem.

Main Results:
- The paper proves that NPG-HM enjoys a sample complexity of O(ε^−2) to achieve an ε-optimal policy in terms of the last iterate. This matches the best known result for policy optimization under a general policy class.

- The analysis relies on establishing a relaxed weak gradient dominance property tailored to NPG, as well as a novel ascent lemma for the NPG update. It also decomposes the error carefully when analyzing the sub-problem solver.

- Experiments on Mujoco environments demonstrate superior performance of NPG-HM compared to prior policy optimization algorithms.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first sample-based NPG method with momentum variance reduction that avoids importance sampling.

- Establishes the optimal sample complexity for last-iterate convergence under a general policy class. 

- Provides a novel analysis framework for sample-based NPG methods by connecting the gradient dominance property with the algorithmic update.

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of the proposed NPG-HM algorithm.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new natural policy gradient method called NPG-HM which utilizes Hessian-aided momentum variance reduction and establishes an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for it to achieve global last-iterate convergence under general policy parameterizations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a new natural policy gradient (NPG) variant called NPG-HM, which utilizes Hessian-aided momentum technique for variance reduction. Compared to other variance reduced NPG methods, NPG-HM is a single-loop algorithm that avoids using importance sampling.

2. It establishes an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for NPG-HM to achieve global last-iterate convergence under general Fisher-non-degenerate policies. This matches the best known result for NPG methods. The analysis relies on a relaxed weak gradient dominance property and a novel ascent lemma tailored for the NPG update.

3. It conducts numerical experiments on Mujoco environments to demonstrate superior performance of NPG-HM over other state-of-the-art policy gradient methods like PPO, NPG-SRVR, etc.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing NPG-HM and proving its fast global convergence rate, which is further validated by strong empirical performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords that seem most relevant:

- Natural policy gradient (NPG): A policy gradient method that uses the Fisher information matrix to precondition the gradient direction. 

- Hessian-aided momentum variance reduction: A variance reduction technique for policy gradients that uses an estimate of the Hessian to construct an unbiased gradient difference estimator.

- Compatible function approximation: A framework to account for the expressiveness of a policy class by bounding the error in approximating the advantage function.  

- Sample complexity: The number of samples (trajectories) needed for an algorithm to achieve a certain accuracy.

- Global convergence: Convergence to the global optimum of the objective function.

- Last-iterate convergence: Bounding the expected suboptimality of the last iterate of an algorithm. 

- Fisher-non-degenerate policy: A policy class that has a well-conditioned Fisher information matrix.

- Relaxed weak gradient domination: A property that lower bounds the squared gradient norm using the suboptimality gap. Can be used to show global convergence.

So in summary, key terms cover concepts like the algorithm itself (NPG-HM), the variance reduction technique, the policy class, convergence guarantees, and properties used in the analysis.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper establishes an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity bound for NPG-HM. Can you walk through the key steps in the proof that lead to this result? What are the key challenges in improving this bound further?

2) The analysis relies on several key assumptions like Fisher non-degeneracy of the policy class and boundedness of policy gradients/Hessians. How reasonable are these assumptions for practical RL problems with neural network policies? Can the analysis be extended by relaxing these assumptions?

3) Explain the main ideas behind using Hessian-aided momentum for variance reduction in the gradient estimates. What are the advantages over prior approaches like importance sampling? Are there any limitations? 

4) The subproblem for computing the natural policy gradient direction is solved approximately using SGD. What complications does this introduce in the convergence analysis compared to solving it exactly? How is this issue handled?

5) Could the analysis be improved by using more advanced optimizers like Adam instead of vanilla SGD for the subproblem? What modifications would be needed?

6) A key ingredient in the analysis is the relaxed weak gradient dominance property. Intuitively explain what this means and why it is useful. Can you think of policy classes where this property may not hold?

7) Compare and contrast the global convergence result established here to prior work on sample-based natural policy gradients. What are the key innovations that lead to the improved sample complexity?

8) The experiments demonstrate superior empirical performance over several baselines. Can you critically analyze the experimental setup and results? What additional experiments could provide further evidence?

9) The paper focuses on an infinite-horizon discounted RL setting. How could the algorithm and analysis be extended to the average reward or episodic setting? What new challenges might arise?

10) A linear convergence rate is proved for exact natural policy gradients under certain conditions. Based on the analysis in this paper, do you think a similar result may hold for the sample-based NPG-HM algorithm? What barriers need to be overcome?
