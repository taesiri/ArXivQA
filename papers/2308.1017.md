# [Model-agnostic search for the quasinormal modes of gravitational wave   echoes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1017)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the search for gravitational wave echoes in a model-agnostic way by targeting the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) of ultracompact objects. Specifically, it aims to optimize the Bayesian search algorithm developed in previous work by incorporating relative phase information of the QNMs.Some key aspects:- Gravitational wave echoes from ultracompact objects can provide insight into quantum gravity effects near black holes. However, the echo waveform has large uncertainties, so model-agnostic search methods are needed.- Existing searches target echoes as quasi-periodic pulses in the time domain. This paper focuses on the frequency domain, where echoes appear as long-lived QNMs. - Previous work discarded phase information, losing sensitivity. This paper keeps the relative phase between QNMs to improve the search.- It introduces a new phase-marginalized likelihood that combines bins belonging to one QNM before marginalizing an overall phase. This makes the search sensitive to weaker signals.- It validates the optimized Bayesian algorithm using a simple uniform echo model and complementary physics-motivated echo waveforms as injections. The method robustly detects the QNMs across different cases.- Results show the new likelihood significantly improves search sensitivity when modes are well-resolved, while both likelihoods play complementary roles when capturing different QNMs.In summary, the paper demonstrates a concrete Bayesian and model-agnostic approach to "quantum black hole seismology" by incorporating relative phase information between the characteristic QNMs associated with echoes. This provides an important complementary technique to existing echo searches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes an improved Bayesian search algorithm for detecting the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with gravitational wave echoes from ultra-compact objects (UCOs). The main contributions are:1. It incorporates relative phase information between QNMs to enhance the search sensitivity, while avoiding introducing additional parameters. This is done by marginalizing a constant phase offset for each QNM when constructing the likelihood. 2. It validates the Bayesian search algorithm using a simple uniform comb model as well as more realistic complementary benchmarks of the echo waveform. The method is shown to be robust and model-agnostic.3. It compares the new phase-marginalized likelihood with the previous amplitude-based one, demonstrating significant improvements, especially when the QNMs are well-resolved in frequency.4. It provides useful insights into how the signal-to-noise ratio, number of modes, time duration etc. influence the search performance for both likelihoods.5. The incorporation of phase information not only improves detectability, but also enables more accurate parameter estimation and physical interpretation of the results.In summary, this study offers a concrete Bayesian and model-agnostic approach to "quantum black hole seismology" by targeting the characteristic QNMs of UCOs in frequency space, complementing existing time-domain burst searches. The improved method will be useful for analyzing gravitational wave data to probe the structure of astrophysical black holes.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on gravitational wave echoes:- This paper focuses specifically on searching for the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with echoes in the frequency domain. Many other searches have targeted echo signals in the time domain by looking for quasi-periodic pulses. So this complements existing work by providing a frequency domain approach.- The authors present a Bayesian search algorithm using a uniform comb model (UEV) as the template. Other frequency-based searches have also used comb templates, but this paper refines the approach by incorporating phase information via a new phase-marginalized likelihood. - The analysis targets long-lived, narrow QNMs that arise when the interior reflectivity is strong. Other studies often focus on quickly damped echoes that are more burst-like. So this provides a way to probe the strong reflectivity regime.- The method is model-agnostic, meaning it does not rely on specific assumptions about the ultracompact object producing echoes. The authors test it on four complementary benchmarks that cover a range of theoretical possibilities. This makes the search more robust compared to model-dependent templates. - The use of Bayesian statistics allows the authors to calculate Bayes factors to quantify evidence for or against echoes in the data. Frequentist approaches like matched filtering do not provide similar model comparisons.- The injection studies demonstrate the ability to accurately recover parameters like the QNM spacing and damping time. This means the method could allow for parameter estimation and "black hole seismology" if echoes are detected.Overall, this paper advances frequency-based, model-agnostic searches for gravitational wave echoes in several notable ways compared to existing literature. The novel phase-marginalized likelihood and tests on diverse echo models help address key challenges facing current search efforts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Applying the proposed search methods to actual gravitational wave data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The authors mention planning to use both the old and new phase-marginalized likelihoods to analyze data and see if they can distinguish signal from instrumental noise lines. - Investigating different approaches for finding the narrow resonance peaks, such as manually scanning over frequency instead of relying solely on stochastic sampling. The authors note this could help address the challenge of detecting high quality factor resonances across a wide frequency band.- Considering more realistic models of ultra-compact objects beyond the simple truncated Kerr metric approximation. The priors and inference of underlying physics may need to be adjusted accordingly.- Exploring the behavior of the search algorithm and waveform models for different source properties like the spin. The authors focus on a high spin merger product but lower spins may exhibit different echo features.- Incorporating mode mixing and overtones into the waveform modeling, which were neglected in this analysis for simplicity. This could reveal new features and refine waveform predictions.- Extending the analysis to comparable-mass ultra-compact object mergers, where additional perturbations may be generated independently inside the object due to time dilation effects.- Developing more robust predictions for the interior reflection coefficients of different ultra-compact object models. This is a major source of uncertainty.In summary, the main future directions are to apply the search methods to real data, refine the waveform models and search algorithms, and reduce uncertainties related to the ultra-compact object physics. The robustness demonstrated in this paper provides a foundation for further studies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper builds upon previous work by the authors to develop a Bayesian search algorithm for detecting characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with gravitational wave echoes from ultracompact objects (UCOs). The key innovation is incorporating relative phase information between the QNMs to optimize the search sensitivity, while still being robust against theoretical uncertainties in the phase modeling. This is achieved through a new phase-marginalized likelihood that retains the relative phases within a QNM while marginalizing over a constant phase offset between different QNMs. To validate the method, the authors construct four complementary benchmarks for echo waveforms spanning diverse theoretical possibilities. They then demonstrate that the Bayesian algorithm, using either the old or new likelihood, can efficiently detect the QNMs associated with these benchmark waveforms injected into Gaussian noise. The new likelihood significantly improves the search sensitivity when the QNMs are well-resolved in frequency space. By complementing existing burst-based searches, this provides a promising model-agnostic approach for probing potential quantum gravity effects in the vicinity of astrophysical black holes through gravitational wave echoes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents an improved Bayesian search algorithm for detecting the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with gravitational wave echoes from ultra-compact objects (UCOs). The search targets the long-lived QNMs in the frequency domain that arise from strong interior reflection and high compactness of the UCO. The authors build upon previous work by incorporating relative phase information between the QNMs to optimize the phase-marginalized likelihood. This allows for a significant improvement in the search sensitivity when the QNMs are well-resolved in frequency space. To validate the search algorithm, the authors construct four complementary benchmarks for the echo waveform spanning different theoretical possibilities. They then inject these waveforms into Gaussian noise and conduct Bayesian searches using the improved likelihood. The results demonstrate efficient detection of the corresponding QNMs across the four benchmarks. By scanning over different time durations of the data segment, they also illustrate the distinct behaviors of the old and new likelihoods. Overall, this improved frequency-domain, model-agnostic approach provides a robust method for probing the near-horizon structure of UCOs through detection of their characteristic QNMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper builds upon previous work by the authors to develop an improved Bayesian search algorithm for detecting the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with gravitational wave echoes from ultracompact objects. The key improvement is incorporating relative phase information between the QNMs to enhance the sensitivity, while still avoiding introducing additional parameters. Specifically, a new phase-marginalized likelihood is derived that coherently combines the frequency bins belonging to each QNM and marginalizes over a constant phase offset per mode. Compared to only using amplitude information, this allows for detecting weaker signals by utilizing the coherent signal-to-noise ratio per mode instead of per frequency bin. The method is validated by conducting injection-recovery studies using both a simple uniform QNM model and more realistic complementary echo waveform benchmarks. The Bayesian algorithm, which searches over spacing, width, amplitude and frequency range, can accurately recover the injected parameters. The new likelihood significantly outperforms the previous amplitude-only likelihood when the QNMs are well-resolved.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of developing a model-agnostic search method to detect gravitational wave echoes in observational data. Gravitational wave echoes are theorized to occur due to quantum gravitational effects near the horizon of ultracompact objects, but the exact waveform is subject to significant theoretical uncertainties. Therefore, the authors aim to design a search method that does not rely heavily on the details of specific echo waveform models.The key questions the paper tackles are:1. How can the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with echoes be efficiently detected in a model-agnostic way?2. Can phase information be incorporated to improve the search sensitivity compared to previous amplitude-only methods? 3. How robust is the search method against theoretical uncertainties in the echo waveform models?To address these questions, the authors build upon their previous work targeting the QNMs in the frequency domain and optimize the search algorithm by developing a new phase-marginalized likelihood. They validate the method using simple uniform echo models as well as more realistic physically-motivated waveforms. Overall, the paper presents a concrete Bayesian approach for "quantum black hole seismology" that is insensitive to the uncertainties in echo waveform modeling.
