# [Model-agnostic search for the quasinormal modes of gravitational wave   echoes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1017)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the search for gravitational wave echoes in a model-agnostic way by targeting the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) of ultracompact objects. Specifically, it aims to optimize the Bayesian search algorithm developed in previous work by incorporating relative phase information of the QNMs.Some key aspects:- Gravitational wave echoes from ultracompact objects can provide insight into quantum gravity effects near black holes. However, the echo waveform has large uncertainties, so model-agnostic search methods are needed.- Existing searches target echoes as quasi-periodic pulses in the time domain. This paper focuses on the frequency domain, where echoes appear as long-lived QNMs. - Previous work discarded phase information, losing sensitivity. This paper keeps the relative phase between QNMs to improve the search.- It introduces a new phase-marginalized likelihood that combines bins belonging to one QNM before marginalizing an overall phase. This makes the search sensitive to weaker signals.- It validates the optimized Bayesian algorithm using a simple uniform echo model and complementary physics-motivated echo waveforms as injections. The method robustly detects the QNMs across different cases.- Results show the new likelihood significantly improves search sensitivity when modes are well-resolved, while both likelihoods play complementary roles when capturing different QNMs.In summary, the paper demonstrates a concrete Bayesian and model-agnostic approach to "quantum black hole seismology" by incorporating relative phase information between the characteristic QNMs associated with echoes. This provides an important complementary technique to existing echo searches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes an improved Bayesian search algorithm for detecting the characteristic quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with gravitational wave echoes from ultra-compact objects (UCOs). The main contributions are:1. It incorporates relative phase information between QNMs to enhance the search sensitivity, while avoiding introducing additional parameters. This is done by marginalizing a constant phase offset for each QNM when constructing the likelihood. 2. It validates the Bayesian search algorithm using a simple uniform comb model as well as more realistic complementary benchmarks of the echo waveform. The method is shown to be robust and model-agnostic.3. It compares the new phase-marginalized likelihood with the previous amplitude-based one, demonstrating significant improvements, especially when the QNMs are well-resolved in frequency.4. It provides useful insights into how the signal-to-noise ratio, number of modes, time duration etc. influence the search performance for both likelihoods.5. The incorporation of phase information not only improves detectability, but also enables more accurate parameter estimation and physical interpretation of the results.In summary, this study offers a concrete Bayesian and model-agnostic approach to "quantum black hole seismology" by targeting the characteristic QNMs of UCOs in frequency space, complementing existing time-domain burst searches. The improved method will be useful for analyzing gravitational wave data to probe the structure of astrophysical black holes.
