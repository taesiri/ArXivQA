## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can be integrated with robotics to enhance robots' reasoning, language understanding, and multimodal processing abilities for complex tasks. However, text-only LLMs lack experiential exposure to the physical world, making decision-making in real environments difficult. Integrating robot visual perception is crucial but poses challenges due to differences in robotics datasets compared to NLP and computer vision.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using the recently released multimodal LLM GPT-4V to generate detailed action plans from natural language instructions and visual perceptions of the environment. This allows leveraging GPT-4V's advanced reasoning and vision-language understanding capabilities to plan robotic tasks. 

Contributions:
1) Comprehensive overview of integrating LLMs with robotics, covering latest advancements in planning, manipulation and reasoning tasks.
2) Summary of key LLM techniques offered to robotics and analysis of training generalized robot strategies.  
3) Evaluation of multimodal GPT-4V on 9 datasets with diverse environments and scenarios for embodied task planning. Results show GPT-4V can effectively plan manipulation tasks from instructions and visual inputs.
4) Identification of limitations around model transparency, robustness and real-world applicability. Discussion on future opportunities like healthcare, agriculture and brain-computer interfaces.

In summary, this paper systematically explores and evaluates the integration of LLMs with robotics, highlighting the promise of LLMs like GPT-4V as well as persisting challenges. Key contributions include the extensive literature review, proposed approach of using GPT-4V for embodied task planning, quantitative evaluation across diverse datasets, and insightful discussion on future directions.
