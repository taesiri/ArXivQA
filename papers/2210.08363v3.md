# [Data-Efficient Augmentation for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08363v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: How can we efficiently select small subsets of training data such that augmenting only those subsets provides similar benefits to augmenting the full training data?The key hypothesis seems to be:Small weighted subsets (coresets) of training data can be identified which, when augmented, closely capture the alignment of the Jacobian matrix (containing all first-order partial derivatives of the neural network) with the label/residual vector. Augmenting just these coresets can provide similar improvements in training dynamics and generalization performance as augmenting the full training data.Specifically, the paper proposes a framework to iteratively extract such coresets. It analyzes how data augmentation affects the singular values/vectors of the neural network Jacobian, and shows that augmenting coresets results in similar effects. Theoretical results are provided on how stochastic gradient descent applied to augmented coresets achieves similar optimization dynamics as augmenting the full data. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy and training speedups from augmenting coresets versus other subsets.In summary, the main research question is how to efficiently select small subsets to augment, and the key hypothesis is that augmenting carefully chosen coresets can provide similar benefits as augmenting all the training data.
