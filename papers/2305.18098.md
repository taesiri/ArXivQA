# [BigTranslate: Augmenting Large Language Models with Multilingual   Translation Capability over 100 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18098)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we augment large language models (LLMs) with multilingual translation capability over 100 languages? 

The key hypothesis is that by continuing to train an existing LLM (LLaMA) with massive Chinese monolingual data, large-scale multilingual parallel data, and multilingual translation instructions, the model can be adapted to perform high-quality translations across more than 100 languages.

In particular, the paper proposes and tests the following hypotheses:

- Augmenting LLaMA's foundation model with additional Chinese data will enhance its Chinese language abilities, providing a stronger basis for multilingual translation centered on Chinese and English.

- Training the foundation model incrementally on a large-scale 102-language parallel corpus will enable it to acquire translation abilities across low-resource and high-resource languages. 

- Applying instruction tuning focused on translation will unlock the model's latent multilingual translation capabilities.

Through experiments on 102 languages, the paper aims to demonstrate that the resulting BigTranslate model can match or exceed the performance of systems like Google Translate and ChatGPT on a diverse range of languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting BigTranslate, a large language model augmented with multilingual translation capability over 100 languages. The key points are:

- They build BigTranslate based on LLaMA-13B, first continuing pre-training it with massive Chinese data, then with a large parallel dataset covering 102 languages. 

- They propose an incremental data sampling strategy during the 102 language pre-training, exposing the model to high-resource languages first then progressively introducing lower-resource languages. 

- They fine-tune the model with multilingual translation instructions to unlock its translation abilities. 

- Experiments show BigTranslate performs comparably to ChatGPT and Google Translate on many language pairs, and even exceeds ChatGPT on 8 pairs when evaluated by GPT-4.

- They release BigTranslate to advance research on extending large language models to more languages and improving low-resource translation.

In summary, the main contribution is developing and releasing BigTranslate, a large language model capable of translating over 100 languages, which was achieved through pre-training strategies to balance high/low resource languages and instruction tuning for translation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces BigTranslate, a large language model adapted from LLaMA and optimized with massive Chinese data and multilingual parallel data covering 102 languages, enabling it to perform translation among over 100 languages comparably with ChatGPT and Google Translate.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper on BigTranslate compares to other related work in multilingual machine translation and large language models:

- Most existing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, PaLM, and BLOOM are English-dominant and only support dozens of languages. This paper introduces BigTranslate which adapts LLaMA to translate over 100 languages, significantly expanding the multilingual capabilities of LLMs.

- While previous work has explored building multilingual neural machine translation models, they focus on balancing training between high and low resource languages. This paper proposes a new incremental training strategy to learn 102 languages in a curriculum-like manner.

- Other multilingual translation models like NLLB aim to translate as many languages as possible but are specialized only for translation. BigTranslate retains the generic capabilities of LLMs while adding multilingual translation ability.

- This paper shows strong translation results on 102 languages, outperforming ChatGPT on 8 language pairs. Previous work evaluated ChatGPT and GPT-3 on fewer multilingual tasks.

- The training methodology of continuing pre-training on monolingual and parallel data could enable extending other LLMs to more languages. The incremental curriculum learning approach is also novel.

In summary, this paper pushes the boundaries of how many languages an LLM can translate by adapting LLaMA with a new incremental training approach. The results demonstrate much wider multilingual capabilities than previous LLMs. The methodology also provides a general framework for training massively multilingual models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further enhancing BigTranslate's ability in low-resource languages. The paper notes that due to unbalanced data, BigTranslate is still weak in several dozen languages. The authors suggest further extending BigTranslate to improve its capabilities for extremely low-resource languages.

- Taking full advantage of BigTranslate's multilingual abilities for other NLP tasks. The authors suggest leveraging BigTranslate's multilingual translation skills to also improve performance across other natural language processing tasks. They note the potential to transfer English and Chinese NLP abilities to lower-resource languages through BigTranslate.

- Evaluating on broader datasets. The preliminary experiments in the paper were on a relatively small evaluaton set of 3,001 sentences translated into 102 languages. The authors could expand the evaluation to broader, more diverse datasets.

- Human evaluation. The authors rely on automatic metrics like BLEU and GPT-4 for evaluation. They could conduct human evaluation to further validate BigTranslate's translation quality. 

- Low-resource translation directions. The current evaluation is from X language to English/Chinese. The model could also be evaluated on translation directions like English/Chinese to X language.

- Multilingual instruction tuning. The instruction tuning focused on translation prompts. Expanding to instructions covering other tasks could unlock BigTranslate's potential for broader NLP abilities.

- Applications of multilingual capabilities. The authors could demonstrate real-world applications leveraging BigTranslate's multilingual translation abilities, like Information Retrieval across languages.

In summary, the key future directions focus on improving low-resource language translation, evaluating on broader datasets/tasks, multitask instruction tuning, and demonstrating practical applications.
