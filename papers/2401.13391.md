# [Beyond Accuracy-Fairness: Stop evaluating bias mitigation methods solely   on between-group metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13391)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current bias mitigation methods focus too much on between-group fairness metrics without considering impact within subgroups. Changes within groups are hard to explain and concerning.
- Prevailing accuracy-fairness evaluation framework does not account for within-group effects.
- Comparing bias mitigation methods solely on prediction labels is insufficient due to:
  1) Unrealistic positive rates 
  2) Fairness metrics often still unsatisfied after mitigation

Proposed Solution:
- Provide transparency into operational dynamics of different bias mitigation methods. Show which instances are impacted within each group.
- Propose new 2-step evaluation framework:
  1) Optimize ranking accuracy within each subgroup
  2) Select highest-ranked individuals from each subgroup to meet fairness criteria and constraints
- Argue to compare methods based on prediction scores (AUC) not labels.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis showing prediction scores/rankings changed significantly by preprocessing and inprocessing methods but not postprocessing
- Criticism of current comparison approach for bias mitigation methods
- Novel 2-step framework to focus on within-group fairness then select top-ranked individuals
- Call for paradigm shift from between-group metrics to establishing best scores/rankings within groups

In summary, the paper argues for a refined perspective in assessing bias mitigation strategies, centered on transparency and equity in outcomes within subgroups rather than just parity between average outcomes across groups. The proposed framework aims to select subgroups optimally first, before ensuring fairness and practical constraints are met.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper argues for a paradigm shift in evaluating bias mitigation methods, from a sole focus on between-group disparities towards establishing the most accurate within-group rankings and then selecting the highest-ranked individuals to meet fairness and practical constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It provides insights into the operational dynamics of different bias mitigation methods, illustrating how some methods significantly impact the ranking within each group while others do not. 

2. It criticizes the current approach of comparing bias mitigation methods, arguing that comparing prediction labels of methods with very different positive rates is inadequate. 

3. It proposes a novel two-step framework: first optimizing for the most accurate ranking within each subgroup using AUC, then selecting the highest ranked individuals from each group based on fairness metrics and practical constraints.

In essence, the paper argues for a paradigm shift from focusing solely on between-group metrics towards establishing the best prediction scores within groups, aligning selections with both fairness and practical considerations. The key insight is that comparing prediction labels of bias mitigation methods often involves comparing inapplicable scenarios. Instead, the ranking accuracy within groups should be optimized before making selections based on constraints.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Fairness metrics (e.g. demographic parity, equalized odds)
- Bias mitigation strategies (e.g. preprocessing, inprocessing, postprocessing) 
- Protected groups/privileged groups
- Proxy variables
- Accuracy metrics (e.g. AUC, accuracy, positive rate)
- Within-group fairness
- Ranking similarity (Kendall-Tau statistic)
- Prediction scores vs prediction labels
- Two-step framework (optimize ranking within groups, select top-ranked individuals)

The paper discusses commonly used fairness metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds. It covers different categories of bias mitigation strategies - preprocessing, inprocessing and postprocessing. The concepts of protected and privileged groups in relation to sensitive attributes are also mentioned. The paper critically analyzes the use of accuracy metrics like AUC and positive rate in comparing bias mitigation methods. It advocates a focus on within-group fairness and using prediction scores rather than labels. The two-step framework is proposed for implementing bias mitigation that first optimizes ranking within groups and then selects top-ranked individuals.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-step framework for implementing bias mitigation strategies. Could you elaborate on the key objectives and considerations in each of these two steps? What are some of the potential challenges in operationalizing this framework?

2. The paper argues for a transition "from focusing on measuring the disparity in prediction labels between-groups to establishing the best prediction scores within-groups." What is the rationale behind this proposed shift? What are some of the limitations of conventional between-group metrics?  

3. The paper contends that current approaches to comparing bias mitigation methods are insufficient. What are some of the key inadequacies highlighted? How does the proposed framework aim to address these?

4. The paper emphasizes the need to evaluate the impact of bias mitigation methods on subgroup rankings. What metrics are proposed to assess changes in rankings? What insights do these metrics provide into the operational dynamics of different methods?

5. Why is examining the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) valuable in the context of bias mitigation strategies? What are some of the advantages of using AUC over other conventional performance metrics?

6. The paper argues against treating bias mitigation methods with significantly different positive rates as comparable situations. What is the rationale behind this argument? How do positive rate constraints pose challenges in real-world applications?

7. What is the fundamental distinction highlighted between pre/inprocessing methods and postprocessing methods regarding impact on rankings? How does this distinction inform the choice and evaluation of methods?  

8. The paper states "for optimal fairness and performance, pre- and inprocessing methods should only be employed if they enhance subgroup rankings." Under what circumstances might exceptions to this statement be warranted?

9. What assumptions does the proposed framework rely on regarding access to sensitive attributes? What are some limitations that emerge in scenarios where these assumptions do not hold?

10. If you had to propose some extensions or refinements to the framework presented in this paper, what would those be? What are some potential directions for future work building on this method?
