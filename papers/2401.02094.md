# [Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Prototype Guided Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02094)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL). In FCIL, multiple clients collaboratively train a global model while keeping their local data private. Each client receives new class data over time and needs to continually update the global model without forgetting previously learned classes. This introduces two key challenges - catastrophic forgetting of old classes and handling non-IID (non-identically distributed) heterogeneous local data across clients.

Solution:
The paper proposes a novel method called Prototype and Low-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA) to address FCIL. The key ideas are:

1) Use a Transformer model (ViT) as the backbone instead of CNNs since Transformers learn more robust global representations. Fine-tune ViT using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) which adapts only a small subset of weights for new tasks. This saves communication costs.

2) Employ prototype learning and propose a prototype re-weighting technique to handle classifier bias and drift caused by non-IID data. Each client sends class prototypes and features to server. The server re-weights prototypes based on their proximity to class features from all clients. This approximates the true global class distribution.

3) Use knowledge distillation to retain discrimination ability for old classes by minimizing feature drift between the current client model and previous global model.

Main Contributions:

- Identify model architecture and classifier bias as common issues in CIL and FL and design solutions targeting them 

- Novel prototype re-weighting method to effectively handle classifier bias and data heterogeneity without retraining

- First work to apply LoRA for efficient fine-tuning in FCIL with low communication overheads

- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet over varying degrees of non-IID data. Much more robust than existing approaches.

In summary, the paper provides valuable insights on the overlap between continual and federated learning challenges, while proposing an elegant prototype and adaptation based solution for class-incremental learning in federated settings. The method demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness owing to its explicit handling of classifier drift caused by non-IID data distributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated class-incremental learning method called PLoRA that uses prototype learning and a prototype re-weighting module built on top of a LoRA-finetuned vision transformer backbone to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness across different non-IID data settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. The paper analyzes the common ground between continual learning (CIL) and federated learning (FL), identifying the choice of model architecture and classifier drift as key issues for both. This motivates the proposed approach. 

2. The paper proposes Prototype and Low-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA) for federated continual learning. It adopts prototype learning and a prototype re-weighting module to address classifier drift. It uses Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune a pretrained model in an end-to-end manner without reliance on similarity-based module selection.

3. The paper conducts extensive experiments on standard datasets where PLoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance. It also extensively evaluates robustness under different non-IID settings and degrees of data heterogeneity, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of PLoRA, a robust and effective approach for federated continual learning that addresses key issues of model architecture and classifier drift in a communication-efficient manner.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Federated learning (FL)
- Class incremental learning (CIL) 
- Federated class incremental learning (FCIL)
- Catastrophic forgetting
- Non-IID data
- Data heterogeneity
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
- Prototype learning
- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
- Model architecture 
- Classifier bias
- Pre-trained models (e.g. ViT, Transformers)
- Knowledge distillation (KD)

The paper proposes a method called "Prototype and Low-Rank Adaptation" (PLoRA) to address the challenges of federated class incremental learning. It utilizes prototype learning and a low-rank adaptation technique called LoRA to fine-tune pre-trained models (like ViT) for the FCIL setting. The goal is to deal with issues like catastrophic forgetting, non-IID data, and classifier bias that commonly affect both federated learning and class incremental learning. So those are some of the main key terms associated with this paper.
