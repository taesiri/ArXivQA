# [Challenge design roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13693)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides guidelines for designing effective machine learning competitions, referred to as "challenges". It argues that organizing a good challenge involves similar considerations as launching a new product, requiring excitement, rigorous testing, and attracting "customers" in the form of participants. 

The paper first outlines key questions organizers should ask themselves before launching a challenge, including:
- Whether they have an appropriate problem that lends itself to a challenge format and is neither too easy nor difficult. Preliminary experimentation by organizers is recommended.

- What the scientific questions and objectives of the challenge are. Competitions should have a specific primary question measured by a single metric. Secondary questions can be incorporated as separate tracks. 

- Whether the organizers have suitable expertise across different aspects like tasks, metrics, data, baseline methods etc. Partnering with experts in missing domain areas is advised.

- Who the target audience is and whether the challenge will attract sufficient interest from them. The problem context, prize incentives, tutorial material etc. should appeal to the desired participants.

The paper then provides a template for the competition proposal, which is typically peer-reviewed by conferences. The proposal should cover background, task novelty, data sources, evaluation metrics, baseline methods, rules, organizational details like schedule, resources etc. 

A sample successful proposal for a metalearning challenge is included as an example appendix.

The paper stresses the importance of clear problem specification, avoiding common pitfalls like using multiple complex metrics, casting an overly broad set of questions, having ambiguous rules or insufficient/biased data. Rigorously beta-testing the competition and calibrating the difficulty level are vital. The discussion also covers establishing proper incentives, harvesting competition results, and promoting participation.

In summary, effective challenge design requires planning across multiple dimensions - problem, data, evaluation, rules, resources, promotion etc. Adhering to the paper's guidelines can help organize exciting and fruitful machine learning competitions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides guidelines for organizing effective machine learning competitions, covering key considerations like defining clear goals, preparing high-quality datasets, designing fair evaluation protocols, avoiding common pitfalls, and engaging participants.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides guidelines for creating a strong plan and proposal for organizing an AI competition or challenge. Some of the key points it covers are:

- Important questions organizers need to ask themselves before starting a challenge, like whether they have an appropriate problem, necessary expertise, resources, plan to harvest results, etc. 

- A template for drafting a competition proposal, with sections on background/impact, novelty, data, tasks, metrics, baselines, rules, schedule, promotion plans, organizing team, resources, etc.

- Examples like a successful NeurIPS competition proposal and a participant fact sheet template. 

- Common pitfalls to avoid when designing challenges, such as lack of clarity, overly complex metrics, trying to solve too many problems at once, not beta testing properly, issues with data quality/leakage, barriers to entry, and more.

- Overall advice on aspects like defining clear scientific questions, understanding participant motivations, preventing cheating, considerations for live competitions, and more.

So in summary, it provides a comprehensive roadmap and helpful guidelines for organizers on designing effective, rigorous, and impactful AI challenges. The proposal template and examples are useful resources for putting together a strong plan.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed for challenge design in this paper:

1) The paper discusses different objectives for organizing challenges such as finding a champion, pushing the state-of-the-art, and making new discoveries. How might you structure a challenge differently if your primary goal is to advance the state-of-the-art versus making new discoveries? What tradeoffs need to be made?

2) When designing the rules and protocols for a challenge involving code submissions, what are some of the key decisions organizers need to make regarding aspects like anonymity, submission limits, result verification etc? What are some pros and cons of different choices?  

3) The paper talks about tuning the difficulty level of a challenge. What metrics could be used to quantify the intrinsic versus modeling difficulty of tasks/datasets? How can these metrics guide the selection and composition of challenges?

4) What are some subtle ways in which data leakage can happen in challenges? How may factors like data collection, pre-processing, synthetic data creation etc introduce hard-to-detect leakage signals? 

5) The proposal template asks organizers to describe baseline methods. What considerations should guide the choice and scope of baseline methods shared with participants? What role do they play in positioning the state-of-the-art?

6) The different challenge protocols like result submission versus code submission have their relative merits and demerits. When is one format preferred over the other? What modifications like meta-testing can help realize the benefits of both?

7) How can the incentives, award structure and prizes be designed to align participant motivations with the scientific goals of the challenge? When might non-monetary incentives like publications be more effective?

8) What steps can organizers take to encourage participation from under-represented groups and make challenges more equitable and accessible? 

9) The paper emphasizes not changing competition rules once introduced. But are there scenarios where late-stage rule changes may be necessary? What factors should drive such decisions?

10) How can effective documentation, tutorials, baseline code etc help lower the barrier to entry for challenges without compromising on problem complexity? What support mechanisms can boost participation?
