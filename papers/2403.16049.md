# [Enhancing Demand Prediction in Open Systems by Cartogram-aided Deep   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16049)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting rental and return patterns (referred to as "demand") at public bicycle stations is challenging due to the openness and imbalanced usage across stations in these shared transportation systems.
- Existing methods have limitations in capturing long-range spatial correlations between stations and predicting demand for newly installed stations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a deep learning framework that leverages cartogram approaches to facilitate prediction for new stations and long-term forecasts.

- They distort the map of station locations using iterative Voronoi tessellation to spread out stations with similar usage patterns, making the distribution more homogeneous.

- This cartogram representation allows predicting demand for new stations based on neighboring stations, without needing historical data.

- They employ a Spatial-Temporal Convolutional Graph Attention Network (ST-CGAN) model architecture that combines self-attention, graph attention, and CNNs.

- The model is trained on public bicycle rental/return data from Seoul, South Korea. Modifications are made to the standard ST-CGAN including batch attention and updated node feature propagation.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of cartogram idea to enable demand prediction for newly installed stations and long-term forecasts, which prior work failed to achieve.

- Modified ST-CGAN model incorporating batch attention for improved accuracy by considering wider temporal context.

- Demonstration of predicting rental/return patterns at both cell and individual station levels, capturing quasi-periodic behaviors.

- Analysis of attention scores indicates the model captures relevant long-range spatial correlations between stations with similar characteristics.

- Overall improved performance over baseline, providing a useful framework for forecasting spatio-temporal patterns in open systems.
