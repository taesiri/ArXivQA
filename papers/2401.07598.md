# [MAPLE: Multilingual Evaluation of Parameter Efficient Finetuning of   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Prior work has shown large gaps in performance of language models (LLMs) on English vs other languages, as well as between large proprietary models vs smaller open-source models. 
- Finetuning can help bridge these gaps but full finetuning of large models is expensive. Hence exploring the efficacy of parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA for multilingual performance is important.

Proposed Solution:
- Finetune smaller LLMs like LLaMA and MiSTRAL using LoRA and QLoRA on the synthetic Multilingual Alpaca dataset with varied ranks and quantization values.
- Evaluate on 5 downstream tasks covering 23 languages to study the impact of rank, quantization, and base LLM choice on performance across languages.
- Also evaluate on Alpaca Eval to measure impact on English language performance.

Key Contributions:
- Benchmark how LoRA rank and quantization affects multilingual performance on various tasks. Find that higher ranks and quantization generally help but lower can sometimes work too.
- Show PEFT of smaller LLMs can bridge gap to proprietary models on some tasks but degrades on others. Finetuning helps low resource languages but can hurt high resource ones.
- Analyze effect of multilingual finetuning on English performance. Significant drops are observed indicating forgetting. Higher rank/quantization preserves English better.
- Provide detailed experimental analysis and results to reveal trends and tradeoffs with multilingual PEFT to guide future research.

In summary, the paper explores multilingual PEFT techniques to make LLMs more equitable across languages. The extensive analysis offers insights into configurations that work best and impact on high vs low resource languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper experiments with parameter efficient finetuning of LLaMA and Mistral models using different LoRA ranks and quantization levels on synthetic multilingual instruction tuning data to analyze their effects on performance across 5 downstream tasks in 23 languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Benchmarking the effects of various ranks and quantizations when finetuning the LLaMA and Mistral models on the MultiAlpaca dataset. Specifically, exploring LoRA ranks 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128, and 4bit, 8bit and 16bit quantization.

2) Analyzing the effects of percentage of trainable parameters and quantization on performance across 5 downstream tasks covering 23 languages. 

3) Analyzing the effects of multilingual parameter efficient finetuning on English performance to check for catastrophic forgetting or degradation.

4) Presenting results and analysis of trends across the models to provide directions for future research on parameter efficient finetuning for multilingual models.

In summary, the main contribution is an extensive analysis of how different hyperparameters affect performance of parameter efficient finetuning techniques like LoRA and QLoRA in the multilingual setting across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper explores finetuning the LLaMA and Mistral models on the MultiAlpaca dataset. What are some key properties and contents of this dataset that make it suitable for multilingual finetuning of models?

2. The paper experiments with different configurations of LoRA rank and quantization values. What is the intuition behind trying different hyperparameter settings for LoRA finetuning? How might rank and quantization affect model performance? 

3. When analyzing the results, the paper finds mixed trends in terms of how rank and quantization affect downstream task performance. What might explain why sometimes higher ranks/quantization helps but other times makes no difference or even hurts performance?

4. For the XNLI and MLQA tasks, the paper observes that finetuning improves low-resource language performance while degrading high-resource language performance. What might cause this disparity and how can it be addressed?

5. The paper compares finetuned model performance to non-finetuned baselines like LLaMA-70B-chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct. What are some limitations in making these comparisons and how might the baseline model prompting/finetuning details affect conclusions?

6. When evaluating on Alpaca Eval, the paper finds significant degradation in English language capabilities after multilingual finetuning. What techniques could help mitigate catastrophic forgetting of high-resource languages?

7. For tasks like XCOPA and XQuAD, finetuning is able to bridge the gap between smaller open-source and larger proprietary models. What properties of these tasks might enable the success of finetuning here?

8. The paper studies only LoRA for parameter-efficient finetuning. How might exploring other techniques like adapters or prompt tuning affect the multilingual performance gains observed?

9. Error analysis: For tasks/languages where finetuning hurt performance, what are some possible reasons? Could test set contamination or distribution shift issues be at play?

10. The paper uses synthetic instruction tuning datasets for finetuning. How might performance trends change if models were finetuned on real-world multilingual instruction data? What are the tradeoffs?
