# [Partition-and-Debias: Agnostic Biases Mitigation via A Mixture of   Biases-Specific Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10005)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we mitigate unknown or agnostic biases when multiple types of biases are present in an image? 

The key hypothesis is that when a neural network is trained on target categories, biases manifest as features scattered at different depths in the network. Thus, the authors propose a "partition-and-debias" approach to divide the bias space into multiple subspaces across network depths and remove biases using multiple bias-specific expert modules.

In summary, the paper introduces the challenging scenario of agnostic biases where both the type and number of biases present are unknown. It hypothesizes that different bias features cluster at different depths, and proposes a novel method to handle this via partitioning and debiasing using experts targeting biases at different levels. The main novelty is in handling multiple unknown biases simultaneously by dividing and conquering in a depth-wise manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Partition-and-Debias (PnD) to mitigate unknown and multiple biases in image classification. The key ideas are:

- Pointing out the existence of multiple unknown biases in real-world image datasets, which is a more challenging scenario than previous works that assume only a single known or unknown bias. 

- Hypothesizing and showing empirically that different bias features manifest at different depths in a neural network when trained on a target task.

- Proposing the PnD method that divides the bias space into multiple subspaces across network depths and inserts "bias-specific experts" to capture and remove biases in each subspace. 

- Using a gating module to combine the outputs of all experts to get the final debiased prediction. 

- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with simulated or real-world unknown/multiple biases compared to previous bias mitigation methods.

In summary, the key novelty is proposing the partition-and-debias strategy to handle the new and more realistic scenario of multiple unknown biases, overcoming limitations of prior arts that assume single or known bias. The mixture of bias-specific experts is an effective approach to implement this idea.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Partition-and-Debias (PnD) to mitigate unknown and multiple biases in image classification by dividing the bias space into subspaces across network depths and removing biases using a mixture of bias-specific experts at different levels.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of bias mitigation:

- This paper introduces a new challenge of handling multiple unknown biases (what they term "agnostic biases") in images, whereas most prior work assumes only a single known or unknown bias. Considering multiple interacting biases is more realistic.

- The proposed Partition-and-Debias (PnD) method follows a divide-and-conquer approach to handle the complex agnostic bias problem. Specifically, it partitions the problem into handling biases at different feature levels/network depths. This differs from prior methods that typically try to address biases in a single step.

- PnD uses a mixture of experts, with each expert focusing on biases at a particular feature level. Other papers have not really explored using mixtures of experts for debiasing as far as I know. The idea of bringing in concepts from mixture of experts is novel.

- They provide strong experimental results showing PnD outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods like LfF, DFA, OccamNet, etc. on datasets exhibiting multiple interacting biases. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach.

- Most other papers have focused more on known/unknown single biases. PnD pushes research forward in handling the more complex and realistic scenario of multiple unknown biases. I think their conceptualization of "agnostic biases" and the PnD method will inspire more work in this direction.

- One limitation is that the method relies on having some unbiased data, whereas some other recent work has focused more on debiasing without needing any unbiased data. But the paper is innovative in tackling the multiple bias problem specifically.

In summary, the paper makes good progress on the important problem of handling multiple interacting unknown biases, which is less explored compared to single bias settings in prior work. The novel PnD approach and experimental results are strong contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to deal with more complex real-world bias scenarios, beyond the limitations of current datasets. The authors note that real-world biases are often more complex, with multiple unknown interacting biases. New methods need to be developed to handle these agnostic biases.

- Extending the partition-and-debias approach to other network architectures and tasks beyond image classification. The current method uses ResNet for image classification, but the overall strategy could potentially be applied to other CNN architectures and tasks like object detection, segmentation, etc.

- Improving computational efficiency. The mixture of experts approach introduces additional parameters and computations that could be optimized, for example by using sparsity or conditional computation.

- Addressing the requirement for some unbiased data. The current method relies on having at least some unbiased training examples. Methods that can work with fully biased training sets need to be explored.

- Theoretical analysis of bias mitigation. More theoretical analysis is needed to formally characterize different types of biases and establish guarantees for when debiasing methods will succeed or fail.

- Social impacts of debiasing. Further analysis of the social impacts of debiasing methods is important as these are applied to sensitive real-world applications.

So in summary, the main future directions are developing methods that can handle more complex real-world bias scenarios, extending the approach to new tasks and architectures, improving computational efficiency, reducing reliance on unbiased data, theoretical analysis, and studying social impacts.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 This paper introduces a new method called Partition-and-Debias (PnD) to mitigate biases in image classification when both the type of bias and number of bias types present in the data are unknown. The key idea is to partition the agnostic bias scenario space into multiple subspaces across different depths of the classification network. Multiple bias-specific expert modules are inserted to capture and remove biases locally in each subspace. A gating module combines the outputs from all experts to make the final prediction. Experiments on public and constructed datasets with complex biases show that PnD outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by effectively handling multiple unknown biases. The partition-and-debias strategy provides a simple yet powerful approach to deal with realistic bias scenarios where both bias type and number are agnostic.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new challenge for bias mitigation called agnostic biases mitigation. Unlike previous work that assumed only a single known or unknown bias in images, the authors consider the realistic scenario where multiple unknown biases of different types may exist in an image. They analyze the CelebA dataset and find most images contain multiple biases related to attributes like gender, attractiveness, and makeup when classifying for age. 

To address this, the authors propose a Partition-and-Debias (PnD) approach that divides the bias space into multiple subspaces across network depths. It uses a mixture of bias-specific expert modules inserted at different depths to capture and remove the biases existing at those levels. A gating module aggregates the outputs of the experts. Experiments on public datasets like Biased MNIST and constructed datasets show PnD achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing debiasing methods, especially when multiple biases are present. The visualizations also demonstrate the experts focus on different bias regions. The partition-and-debias strategy provides an effective way to handle the realistic and challenging scenario of agnostic biases.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Partition-and-Debias (PnD) approach to address the problem of mitigating multiple unknown biases (agnostic biases) in image classification. The key idea is to partition the bias space into multiple subspaces across different depths of the classification network and remove biases from each subspace using a mixture of bias-specific experts. Specifically, the method uses two encoders to extract target features and bias features from images. It then inserts bias-specific expert modules after each block of the encoders, with each expert containing a debiased classifier and bias classifier. The experts process the target and bias features to perform debiased classification and bias detection. An adaptive gating module mixes the outputs of the experts to produce the final debiased prediction. The method is trained in two phases - an initial training phase to learn target and bias features, and a counterfactual training phase to further disentangle the features. The mixture of experts along with training enables capturing and removing multiple unknown biases simultaneously from different feature levels.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Most prior work on bias mitigation in image classification assumes there is only a single known or unknown bias type present in the data. However, real-world datasets often contain multiple unknown bias types. 

- The paper introduces a new challenging scenario called "agnostic biases mitigation" where both the types of biases and number of bias types present are unknown. This represents a more realistic bias scenario.

- The key hypothesis is that different bias features manifest in different layers/depths of a neural network classifier. Even if multiple biases are entangled at one depth, they can be treated as a single bias type.

- The paper proposes a Partition-and-Debias (PnD) approach to address the agnostic biases scenario. The key ideas are:

1) Partition the bias space into subspaces that correspond to different network depths. This allows handling multiple bias types simultaneously. 

2) Use a mixture of bias-specific expert modules inserted at different depths to capture and remove the biases present at that depth.

3) Combine the outputs of the experts using an adaptive gating module.

- Experiments on public datasets like Biased MNIST and BAR, as well as constructed datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of PnD, especially when multiple unknown bias types are present.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a more realistic agnostic bias scenario involving multiple unknown bias types, and presenting a partition-and-debias approach using expert modules at different depths to handle this scenario effectively.
