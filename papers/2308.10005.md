# [Partition-and-Debias: Agnostic Biases Mitigation via A Mixture of   Biases-Specific Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10005)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we mitigate unknown or agnostic biases when multiple types of biases are present in an image? The key hypothesis is that when a neural network is trained on target categories, biases manifest as features scattered at different depths in the network. Thus, the authors propose a "partition-and-debias" approach to divide the bias space into multiple subspaces across network depths and remove biases using multiple bias-specific expert modules.In summary, the paper introduces the challenging scenario of agnostic biases where both the type and number of biases present are unknown. It hypothesizes that different bias features cluster at different depths, and proposes a novel method to handle this via partitioning and debiasing using experts targeting biases at different levels. The main novelty is in handling multiple unknown biases simultaneously by dividing and conquering in a depth-wise manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called Partition-and-Debias (PnD) to mitigate unknown and multiple biases in image classification. The key ideas are:- Pointing out the existence of multiple unknown biases in real-world image datasets, which is a more challenging scenario than previous works that assume only a single known or unknown bias. - Hypothesizing and showing empirically that different bias features manifest at different depths in a neural network when trained on a target task.- Proposing the PnD method that divides the bias space into multiple subspaces across network depths and inserts "bias-specific experts" to capture and remove biases in each subspace. - Using a gating module to combine the outputs of all experts to get the final debiased prediction. - Achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with simulated or real-world unknown/multiple biases compared to previous bias mitigation methods.In summary, the key novelty is proposing the partition-and-debias strategy to handle the new and more realistic scenario of multiple unknown biases, overcoming limitations of prior arts that assume single or known bias. The mixture of bias-specific experts is an effective approach to implement this idea.
