# [Interactive Autonomous Navigation with Internal State Inference and   Interactivity Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16091)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework to control autonomous vehicles for safe and efficient navigation at intersections. The method incorporates three auxiliary supervised learning tasks: (1) inferring surrounding drivers' internal states (i.e., traits like aggressive/conservative and intentions like yield/not yield); (2) predicting surrounding vehicles' future trajectories both with and without the ego vehicle via counterfactual reasoning; and (3) estimating interactivity scores between agents based on trajectory prediction differences. These tasks not only improve driving performance in terms of completion rate, collision rate, and efficiency but also enhance transparency by providing intermediate explainable indicators. Specifically, inferred driver traits and intentions inform decision making, while estimated influence degrees facilitate reasoning about negotiability. The method employs graph neural networks to model relations and interactions between road users. Experiments in a simulated four-way intersection with vehicles and pedestrians demonstrate superior performance and robustness over baselines. The ablation study validates the contribution of each module. Overall, this work presents an interpretable reinforcement learning approach to control autonomous vehicles that effectively handles complex interactive scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework with auxiliary supervised learning tasks of internal state inference, trajectory prediction, and interactivity estimation to enable transparent and efficient decision making for autonomous navigation in interactive multi-agent environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a deep reinforcement learning framework for interactive autonomous navigation with three auxiliary tasks: internal state inference, trajectory prediction, and interactivity estimation. 

2. The auxiliary tasks improve the decision making performance and enhance the transparency/explainability of the proposed framework by inferring intermediate features (i.e. internal states and interactivity scores) of surrounding agents.

3. Designing an intersection driving simulator based on the Intelligent Intersection Driver Model that simulates vehicles and pedestrians to validate the proposed approach.

4. Demonstrating superior performance over baselines in terms of completion rate, collision rate, driving efficiency, and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. The proposed method also provides intermediate indicators that enable explainable decision making.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a deep reinforcement learning based framework for autonomous navigation that integrates multiple auxiliary tasks to improve performance and explainability. The method is validated in a novel simulated intersection environment with vehicles and pedestrians.

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework to control autonomous vehicles to safely and efficiently navigate complex interactive traffic scenarios such as intersections. Key aspects include: 1) Inferring surrounding vehicles' traits (conservative/aggressive) and intentions (yield/not yield) as intermediate explainable features. 2) Counterfactual trajectory prediction to estimate interactivity scores that indicate the ego vehicle's degree of influence on others. 3) Using graph neural networks for spatio-temporal relational reasoning between interactive entities. The method is validated in a simulated four-way intersection environment with vehicles and pedestrians.
