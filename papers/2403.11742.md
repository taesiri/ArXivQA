# [Accelerating Model Predictive Control for Legged Robots through   Distributed Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful technique for generating complex motions in legged robots. However, the associated optimization problems are computationally demanding, limiting the update rates and horizon lengths that can be achieved. This restricts the agility and dynamism of the resulting motions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel framework to accelerate MPC for legged robots using distributed optimization based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The key idea is to decompose the robot model into smaller, parallelizable subsystems and run an MPC for each subsystem. ADMM is then used to ensure consensus among the subsystems' solutions.

The robot dynamics are split such that each subsystem sees the effect of other subsystems through an interaction wrench. Separate optimal control problems (OCPs) with reduced state dimensions are formulated for each subsystem and solved in parallel using ADMM for consensus. This exploits modern hardware parallelism more effectively.

Contributions:

- Development of a distributed ADMM-based framework to decompose whole-body MPC into smaller subsystem OCPs that can be solved in parallel 

- The approach is highly scalable - adding more subsystems does not affect overall solve time. This enables incorporating articulated limbs without performance loss

- Quantitative evaluation showing up to 4x speedups compared to centralized MPC, with similar motion quality

- Convergence analysis and robustness validation across varying system complexes 

- Demonstrated agile maneuvers enabled by efficient distributed whole-body MPC, like bipedal walking and simultaneous base locomotion and arm trajectory tracking

Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to overcome the computational bottlenecks of MPC for complex legged systems by effectively harnessing modern parallel hardware. The distributed formulation demonstrates substantial improvements in speed while maintaining accuracy and easy extensibility.
