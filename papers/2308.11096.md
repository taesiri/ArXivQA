# [MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on   NISQ Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11096)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, it seems the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:How can we develop a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that can run on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers to address the problems of poor quality and robustness in previous quantum image generation techniques?The paper introduces a method called MosaiQ that is proposed as a solution to this question. The abstract states MosaiQ is a "high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that can be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers" to address limitations of previous quantum image generation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Unfortunately the paper content appears to be missing or incomplete, as it only contains the LaTeX formatting and bibliographic information. Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution is introducing a new quantum image generation framework called "MosaiQ" that can generate high-quality images using generative adversarial networks on near-term intermediate-scale quantum computers. The abstract mentions this framework addresses problems with quality and robustness in previous quantum image generation techniques. However, without the full paper content, I cannot confidently summarize the main contribution or technical details.
