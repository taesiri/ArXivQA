# [Abstracting Sparse DNN Acceleration via Structured Sparse Tensor   Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07953)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) have massive computational requirements. Sparsity in DNN models (zero values in weights and activations) provides an opportunity to improve efficiency by skipping redundant computations.  
- However, there is a mismatch between what model developers and hardware designers prefer - model developers induce unstructured sparsity for better accuracy while hardware designers prefer structured sparsity patterns for efficient acceleration. This hampers adoption of sparse DNN acceleration in practice.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Tensor Approximation via Structured Decomposition (TASD) to bridge this gap. TASD decomposes any unstructured sparse tensor into a series of structured sparse tensors. 
- They develop a software framework called TASDER that searches for high-quality structured decomposition for each DNN layer. This allows accelerating the DNN on hardware with structured sparsity support.

Main Contributions:
- First work to enable acceleration of unstructured sparse DNNs on structured sparse hardware by approximating tensors with structured sparse terms.
- TASDER framework to find layer-wise structured decomposition configurations to maximize acceleration while preserving accuracy.
- Minor architectural extensions to existing structured sparse hardware to execute the TASD approximation efficiently.
- Evaluation shows TASD improves energy-delay product by up to 83% without loss of accuracy or fine-tuning for DNNs like ResNet and BERT. Computes reduced by 40% on average across DNNs.

In summary, the paper introduces an abstraction layer between model developers and hardware designers via structured tensor decomposition. This abstraction allows developers to freely induce sparsity while only requiring structured sparse hardware support.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a tensor approximation method via structured decomposition (TASD) to bridge the gap between unstructured sparse deep neural networks preferred by model developers and structured sparse hardware preferred by hardware designers, enabling efficient acceleration of sparse and dense models on structured sparse hardware without extra fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Tensor Approximation via Structured Decomposition (TASD) to bridge the gap between unstructured sparse deep neural networks (DNNs) preferred by model developers and structured sparse hardware preferred by hardware designers. Specifically:

1) They propose TASD, which decomposes any unstructured sparse tensor into a series of structured sparse tensors that can be efficiently executed on structured sparse hardware. This allows unstructured sparsity to be accelerated without costly indexing/routing logic.

2) They develop a framework called TASDER that automatically finds high-quality TASD configurations (i.e. which structured sparse patterns to use in the decomposition) for each layer in a DNN to maximize performance while preserving accuracy.

3) They propose minimal extensions to existing structured sparse accelerators to execute the TASD decomposition, as well as optimized dataflow to maximize data reuse.

4) They evaluate TASD on several state-of-the-art DNNs and show it can accelerate both naturally sparse and dense models on structured sparse hardware, improving energy-delay product by up to 83% without accuracy loss or model fine-tuning.

In summary, TASD introduces a new abstraction layer between model developers and hardware designers that allows unstructured sparsity to be efficiently executed on structured sparse hardware. This is achieved by approximating unstructured sparsity with structured sparse patterns in a way that is transparent to both developers and hardware.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Tensor approximation via structured decomposition (TASD): The method proposed to approximate unstructured sparse tensors as a series of structured sparse tensors.

- TASD series: The series of structured sparse tensors that approximates the original unstructured sparse tensor. Analogous to a Taylor series approximation.

- Unstructured sparsity: Sparsity pattern without any specific structure, offers flexibility but harder to accelerate in hardware.

- Structured sparsity: Sparsity with some specific patterns (like 2:4, 4:8 etc.), easier to accelerate efficiently in hardware but less flexible. 

- TASDER: The software framework proposed that searches for good TASD configurations to transform unstructured sparsity to structured on a per-layer basis.

- Software/hardware co-design: The approach of co-designing the algorithm (TASD) along with the hardware architecture support to efficiently execute the TASD approximation.

- Activation sparsity: Runtime sparsity arising from activation functions like ReLU. Harder to accelerate directly compared to static weight sparsity.

- Model pruning: Technique to induce sparsity in DNN models by removing redundant parameters. Flexible unstructured pruning induces unstructured sparsity.

The key ideas are using TASD to bridge the gap between unstructured software sparsity and structured hardware sparsity, through an effective system-algorithm co-design approach enabled by the TASDER software framework.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed TASD method leverage the distributive property of linear algebra to decompose an unstructured sparse tensor into structured sparse terms? Can you explain the mathematical formulation behind this with an example?

2. The paper argues that TASD provides a better abstraction between model developers and hardware designers for exploiting sparsity. Can you elaborate on what issues existed in prior work that led to this mismatch and how TASD helps resolve it through a new interface?  

3. What are the key differences between applying TASD on weights (TASD-W) versus activations (TASD-A)? What considerations went into designing the layer-wise configurations for each?

4. The paper proposes a sparsity-based heuristic for selecting TASD configurations per layer. Can you explain this heuristic and why it was chosen over other potential methods? What are its limitations?

5. How does the proposed TASDER framework operate to find optimal TASD configurations? Walk through its end-to-end flow for a given model and hardware target.

6. The TTC accelerator extends prior structured sparse designs with TASD units. Explain the microarchitecture of these units and how they enable dynamic decomposition of activations.

7. What customizations were made to the TTC dataflow to efficiently execute the TASD matrix decomposition terms? How does it maximize data reuse?  

8. Beyond sparsity, the paper claims TASD can also help accelerate dense, non-ReLU models by approximating them. Explain the proposed "pseudo-density" heuristic that enables this.

9. What were the area overheads measured from RTL synthesis when adding TASD units to the baseline accelerator? How might this change with different structured sparse baseline designs?

10. The paper demonstrates TASD on ResNet and BERT models. What other types of models do you think would be good candidates for evaluation? How might TASD's effectiveness change?
