# [What makes an image realistic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper discusses the challenge of quantifying how realistic a piece of data (e.g. an image) is. This is an important problem with applications like detecting anomalies or evaluating generative models.

- Common approaches like using probability or typicality fail to capture realism. These methods test if data matches a distribution, but don't answer if the distribution itself produces realistic data.

- Other methods like divergences and adversarial losses work better but have limitations. They require full access to distributions or adversarial training.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes using "universal critics" based on algorithmic information theory concepts like Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff probability. 

- The universal critic, $U(x)$, measures the randomness deficiency by comparing the negative log probability under a model $P$ to the Kolmogorov complexity $K(x)$, capturing how easy $x$ is to describe.

- This elegantly tests if $x$ matches $P$, without assuming $P$ produces realistic data. Easy to describe data (low $K(x)$) is flagged even if probable under $P$.

- $U(x)$ naturally handles tradeoffs between complexity and likelihood. Simple unrealistic data is caught due to low complexity. Complex unrealistic data is caught due to low likelihood under $P$.

- Batched critics $U(x^B)$ applied to batches of data interpolate between single-data metrics and distribution divergences based on the batch size.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a principled information-theoretic foundation for defining and quantifying realism of data.

- Generalizes both single-data metrics and distribution divergences within one formalism based on randomness deficiency.

- Concept of universal critic elegantly captures key desiderata for realism metrics without needing adversarial training.

- Explains successes of existing methods like input complexity and score distillation sampling through the lens of universal critics.

In summary, the paper proposes an elegant formalism for quantifying realism based on algorithmic information theory, unifying several existing approaches. The universal critic provides a "North Star" for developing practical methods to assess realism.
