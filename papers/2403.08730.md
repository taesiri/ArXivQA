# [Strengthening Multimodal Large Language Model with Bootstrapped   Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating responses based on visual inputs, but often suffer from bias towards responses similar to their pretraining corpus, overshadowing visual information. 
- This bias acts as an inherited "preference" for the pretraining statistics, which hinders grounding responses in the visual inputs.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce bootstrapped preference optimization (BPO) to conduct preference learning using datasets with negative responses bootstrapped from the MLLM itself.
- Generate negative responses in two ways: 
   1) Distort image inputs to reveal pretraining bias  
   2) Inject common but erroneous elements into original responses using the LLM component
- Construct preference dataset pairing original responses (positive) with bootstrapped responses (negative).
- Optimize the preference dataset using direct preference optimization (DPO).

Key Contributions:
- Formulate multimodal alignment as a preference learning problem between pretraining bias ("old preference") and visual grounding ("new preference").
- Propose scalable strategies to automatically construct preference datasets at scale without manual annotation.
- Introduce variant of DPO suitable for MLLMs to suppress pretraining bias and enhance visual grounding. 
- Achieve significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, advancing state-of-the-art in multimodal conversational systems.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed bootstrapped preference optimization solution, and highlights the main contributions around formulating a new preference learning perspective for multimodal alignment, scalable preference dataset construction, and advancing state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Bootstrapped Preference Optimization (BPO), a method to mitigate bias in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by constructing preference datasets using distorted images and text modifications to elicit undesirable responses, and then optimizes the model to prefer grounded responses over biased ones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel viewpoint to formulate the multimodal alignment of MLLMs as a preference learning problem, where the pretraining bias and visual grounding are treated as the old and new preferences respectively. 

2. It introduces an innovative approach to construct preference datasets at scale by generating negative responses automatically via image-weakened prompting and LLM-bias injection. The negative responses effectively expose the pretraining bias.

3. It demonstrates through extensive experiments that the proposed Bootstrapped Preference Optimization (BPO) approach effectively enhances the visual grounding of MLLMs and leads to significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal conversational systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
- Pretraining bias

- Bootstrapped Preference Optimization (BPO)
- Image-weakened prompting

The paper proposes a new method called Bootstrapped Preference Optimization (BPO) to mitigate the pretraining bias in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by treating it as a preference that needs to be adapted. It constructs preference datasets by generating negative responses using image-weakened prompting and LLM bias injection. It then optimizes the model directly on this dataset using direct preference optimization. The method is evaluated on helpfulness and visual truthfulness benchmarks and shows improved performance over baselines.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes treating the bias inherited from pre-training as an "old preference". What are some ways to further characterize and quantify this old preference? How can we measure the degree to which the old preference affects model outputs?

2. Image-weakened prompting is used to elicit responses revealing pre-training bias. What are some alternative strategies to expose and quantify the pre-existing biases, especially those implicit biases that may not surface through weakened inputs? 

3. The error injection strategy relies on the LLM component to modify ground truth responses. Would an iterative error injection process, with multiple rounds of modifications, better expose model weaknesses? How can we automatically determine the optimal number of iterations?

4. The paper compares the method to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). What are the key differences in how SFT and bootstrapped preference optimization affect the model's internal representations and output distributions? What causes the consistently better performance of preference learning?

5. How does the scale and diversity of the preference dataset affect the extent of bias mitigation and performance improvements? What data augmentation techniques could expand the preference dataset to better cover the weakness of MLLMs?

6. The direct preference optimization used here is adapted from prior work in aligning LLMs. How does the multi-modality and continuous nature of inputs affect the formulation and performance of preference learning for MLLMs?

7. The paper focuses on improving faithfulness to visual inputs. How can the method be extended to align MLLMs along other modalities such as audio, video, sensory signals etc? What modalities offer the most promise and challenges?

8. What forms of preference hacking are MLLMs still susceptible to after bootstrapped preference optimization? How can we characterize risks and failure modes? What safeguards need to be in place before deployment?

9. How does the technique extend to other MLLM architectures besides LLaVA? What architectural properties affect the ease of applying bootstrapped preference optimization?

10. What theoretical insights into the working of MLLMs does this preference learning view offer? How does it connect to other theories around model objectives, inductive biases, and generalization?
