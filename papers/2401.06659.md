# [WisdoM: Improving Multimodal Sentiment Analysis by Fusing Contextual   World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to identify sentiment polarity from multimodal data like images and text. 
- Most existing methods rely on superficial information and lack incorporation of contextual world knowledge beyond the provided data. This limits their performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes WisdoM, a plug-in framework to leverage contextual world knowledge from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis.

Key Ideas:
- Use ChatGPT to generate prompt templates for the LVLMs to produce contextual information called "context" based on the image and sentence. 
- Introduce a training-free Contextual Fusion mechanism to reduce noise in the generated context and selectively fuse it only for hard samples.

Main Contributions:
- Propose the WisdoM framework that utilizes LVLMs to generate and incorporate contextual world knowledge to boost multimodal sentiment analysis performance.
- Introduce the Contextual Fusion technique to handle noise in the generated context.
- Evaluate on multiple benchmarks and models, consistently showing significant gains over state-of-the-art methods. 
- Conduct extensive analysis to provide insights on what world knowledge helps, how context aids analysis, and why fusion works on hard samples.

In summary, the key innovation is utilizing world knowledge from LVLMs via prompt templates and fusing it wisely to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis abilities. Both the broad effectiveness across models and datasets, and the extensive analysis provide strong evidence.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a plug-in framework called WisdoM that improves multimodal sentiment analysis by leveraging large vision-language models to generate contextual world knowledge which is then fused using a contextual fusion mechanism to handle noise.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a plug-in framework called WisdoM that leverages large vision-language models to generate contextual world knowledge to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis. 

2. Introducing a novel contextual fusion mechanism to mitigate the impact of noise in the generated context and wisely incorporate it to improve performance.

3. Conducting experiments on three multimodal sentiment analysis benchmarks with several advanced VLP models, showing that WisdoM brings consistent and significant improvements (up to +5.8 F1 score).

So in summary, the key contribution is the WisdoM framework that can effectively utilize contextual world knowledge from large language models to boost multimodal sentiment analysis across various models and datasets. The key ideas are generating pertinent context, handling noise in the context via contextual fusion, and demonstrating consistent gains.
