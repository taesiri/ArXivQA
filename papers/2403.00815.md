# [RAM-EHR: Retrieval Augmentation Meets Clinical Predictions on Electronic   Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00815)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich patient information that can be used to make clinical predictions, but directly using raw EHR data faces challenges due to noise and lack of external knowledge. 

- Existing methods that incorporate external knowledge from medical corpora can retrieve irrelevant information or fail to summarize knowledge effectively.

Method:
- The paper proposes a new method called CARE which performs joint Retrieval-Augmented Model Learning (RAML) to enhance EHR predictions. 

- CARE first retrieves relevant passages from a collection of medical corpora based on input medical codes. 

- An language model summarizes the retrieved passages into condensed knowledge to capture semantics of the codes. 

- This summarized knowledge is fed into an "augmented model" to make predictions. 

- In parallel, a "local model" makes predictions directly from the EHR data.

- The predictions from the two models are combined via co-training and consistency regularization.

Contributions:
- Novel retrieval-based knowledge augmentation method to incorporate external knowledge into EHR predictive models.

- Co-training scheme that leverages information from both visit data and semantic knowledge perspectives.

- Extensive experiments show CARE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on prediction tasks using two healthcare datasets.

- Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of different components in CARE. Case studies illustrate CARE provides more relevant information than directly prompting language models.

In summary, the key innovation is the joint learning approach to effectively integrate retrieved and summarized external knowledge to enhance clinical predictions from EHRs.
