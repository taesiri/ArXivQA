# [SAVE: Protagonist Diversification with Structure Agnostic Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02503)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called SAVE for single-shot video editing to replace the protagonist in a source video with a new one while preserving the original motion. A key limitation of existing video editing methods is that they struggle to handle large changes to the body structure of the protagonist. The authors identify a location bias issue in current approaches where motion-related words like "roaring" incorrectly focus on static appearance features rather than dynamic motions. To address this, SAVE introduces a new motion word embedding $S_{mot}$ with expanded temporal information to better capture motions across frames. Two additional components further improve $S_{mot}$'s modeling - a motion-aware cross-attention loss to concentrate on moving areas, and pre-registering an appearance word $S_{pro}$ to disentangle identity from motion. Experiments demonstrate SAVE's ability to edit highly distinct protagonists like changing a cat to Pikachu while maintaining motions, outperforming recent video editing techniques. A limitation is handling multiple moving protagonists or complex background motions. Key innovations are expanding textual embeddings for motions, guiding attention to moving areas, and decoupling appearance and movement. The method advances single-shot video editing with greater flexibility in editing protagonists.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a video editing method that can replace the protagonist in a source video with a new one that has a very different body structure, while preserving the original motion, by using a specialized motion word vector that focuses on learning the motion across frames.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to edit the protagonist of a video while preserving the original motion, even when the new protagonist has a very different body structure compared to the original one. Specifically:

- They identify a location bias issue in existing video editing methods, where motion-related words tend to highlight static parts of the protagonist rather than the actual moving areas. This makes the methods rely too much on temporal self-attention and fail when the protagonist structure changes.

- They introduce a new motion word with expanded temporal embeddings to better capture the motion across frames. This allows generating a new protagonist that matches the motion from the start.

- They propose additional techniques like cross-attention regularization and pre-registration of the original protagonist appearance to help the motion word focus on and disentangle the motion effectively.

In experiments, they demonstrate their method's ability to edit the protagonist to new objects with very different shapes/arrangements while retaining the original specific motion, outperforming previous state-of-the-art video editing techniques. This contributes toward more flexible and broader video editing capabilities.

The paper introduces a method called SAVE (Protagonist Diversification with Structure Agnostic Video Editing) that can edit the protagonist in a source video while preserving the original motion, even for protagonists with very different body structures. The key ideas include using a "motion word" to represent the motion, regularizing the attention of this word to focus on motion areas, and pre-registering the appearance of the original protagonist. The goal is to enable broader editing capabilities for text-to-video generation models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that existing video editing methods have difficulty generating a new protagonist that deviates significantly from the original in terms of body structure. Why does this limitation exist? What are the underlying reasons that cause this bias?

2. The proposed method introduces a new motion word embedding $S_{mot}$ with expanded text embeddings over time. Explain the formulation of $S_{mot}$ and how it helps capture motion information compared to using a single embedding. 

3. The paper computes pseudo optical flow from pre-calculated attention maps to identify motion areas without needing an optical flow model. Walk through the details of how this pseudo optical flow is estimated. What are the advantages?

4. Explain the role of the motion-aware cross attention loss $\mathcal{L}_{attn}$. How exactly does it constrain the cross-attention map of $S_{mot}$? Why is this important?

5. The method adopts a two-stage training strategy involving pre-registration of a protagonist pseudo-word $S_{pro}$. What is the purpose of this strategy? How does disentangling appearance help in learning the motion?

6. Analyze the ablation study results removing different components of the proposed method. Which aspect causes the most performance drop when removed? What does this imply about the importance of different modules?

7. The paper demonstrates that freezing temporal self-attention (T-Attn) layers degrades performance more significantly in baseline models compared to the proposed method. Analyze why this happens and what it indicates about reliance on T-Attn.  

8. What are the limitations of only considering protagonist motion and not handling background or camera motion? How feasible would it be to extend the method to handle more complex scene dynamics?

9. The method struggles with editing videos containing multiple protagonists. Speculate on the reasons for this limitation and propose ideas to address it. 

10. The proposed motion word embedding opens up an interesting concept of "personalized motion". What other potential applications can you envision for this idea apart from video editing? How might it impact future video generation research?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing video editing methods that replace a protagonist in a source video struggle when the new protagonist has a very different body structure from the original one. Specifically, they fail to accurately reproduce the original motion on the new protagonist. 

Reasons: 
- Motion-related words (e.g. "walking") attend to incorrect spatial regions in the video due to "location bias" acquired from static image datasets. Thus very little motion information is used from these words.
- The model relies too heavily on temporal self-attention to generate motion, but this mechanism lacks spatial relationship modeling critical for reproducing motions on differently structured protagonists.

Proposed Solution - KEY IDEAS:
1) Introduce new "motion word" token $S_{mot}$ with text embeddings expanded along the temporal dimension to accurately represent motion across frames.

2) Propose "motion aware cross-attention loss" to constrain $S_{mot}$ to focus on protagonist's moving areas only. This is enabled by estimating a "pseudo optical flow" from spatial attention maps without extra flow models.  

3) Pre-register a "protagonist word" $S_{pro}$ to disentangle appearance from motion. $S_{mot}$ then specializes in encoding motion.

Together this guides $S_{mot}$ to effectively learn the motion, reducing dependence on temporal self-attention. Allows generating new protagonists with very different structures while preserving motion.

Main Contributions:
- Identified "location bias" issue in prior arts limiting editing flexibility
- Motion word token with temporally expanded embeddings to accurately represent motions
- Motion aware cross-attention regularization strategy 
- Demonstrated broader editing capability on protagonists with substantially different structures
