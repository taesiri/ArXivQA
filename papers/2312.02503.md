# [SAVE: Protagonist Diversification with Structure Agnostic Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02503)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called SAVE for single-shot video editing to replace the protagonist in a source video with a new one while preserving the original motion. A key limitation of existing video editing methods is that they struggle to handle large changes to the body structure of the protagonist. The authors identify a location bias issue in current approaches where motion-related words like "roaring" incorrectly focus on static appearance features rather than dynamic motions. To address this, SAVE introduces a new motion word embedding $S_{mot}$ with expanded temporal information to better capture motions across frames. Two additional components further improve $S_{mot}$'s modeling - a motion-aware cross-attention loss to concentrate on moving areas, and pre-registering an appearance word $S_{pro}$ to disentangle identity from motion. Experiments demonstrate SAVE's ability to edit highly distinct protagonists like changing a cat to Pikachu while maintaining motions, outperforming recent video editing techniques. A limitation is handling multiple moving protagonists or complex background motions. Key innovations are expanding textual embeddings for motions, guiding attention to moving areas, and decoupling appearance and movement. The method advances single-shot video editing with greater flexibility in editing protagonists.
