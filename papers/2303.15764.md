# [X-Mesh: Towards Fast and Accurate Text-driven 3D Stylization via Dynamic   Textual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15764)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve text-driven 3D stylization to achieve more accurate and faster stylization results?The key points related to this question are:- Existing text-driven 3D stylization methods lack explicit textual guidance during the prediction of vertex attributes. This leads to unsatisfactory stylization results and slow convergence speed. - The authors propose a new framework called X-Mesh to address these limitations. The key novelty is a text-guided dynamic attention module (TDAM) that incorporates spatial and channel-wise attention to extract text-relevant vertex features. - They construct a new benchmark dataset and propose evaluation metrics to enable fair comparison of text-driven 3D stylization methods.So in summary, the paper focuses on improving the accuracy and efficiency of text-driven 3D stylization through a novel text-guided dynamic attention approach. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated using a new standardized benchmark and metrics.
