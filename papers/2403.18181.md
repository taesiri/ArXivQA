# [Compression of the Koopman matrix for nonlinear physical models via   hierarchical clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18181)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Koopman operator theory allows linear analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems, which is useful for prediction and control. 
- However, constructing the Koopman operator requires a large dictionary size, resulting in a huge Koopman matrix which is computationally expensive. 
- Existing methods like SVD for matrix compression sacrifice accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method to compress the Koopman matrix using hierarchical clustering on its rows and columns. 
- Similar rows/columns are grouped together and averaged to construct a much smaller compressed Koopman matrix.
- Additional compressed dictionaries before and after the matrix action are constructed to maintain accuracy.
- An extra matrix is introduced to recover the suitable dictionary size for repeated application.

Main Contributions:
- A new way to compress the Koopman matrix using hierarchical clustering that maintains accuracy better than SVD.
- Achieves 5 times speedup in computation time with compression ratio of [0.4, 0.4] on the cart-pole model.
- First application of hierarchical clustering for Koopman matrix compression.
- The hierarchical structure extracts important dynamics from the Koopman matrix for physical systems.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering based method to compress the Koopman matrix that speeds up computation while retaining prediction accuracy, outperforming conventional SVD. This opens up new possibilities for exploiting hierarchical structures in Koopman matrices to understand dynamics of physical systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to compress the Koopman matrix, which enables linear analysis of nonlinear systems, using hierarchical clustering of its rows and columns to reduce computational complexity while retaining predictive accuracy better than conventional singular value decomposition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to compress the Koopman matrix using hierarchical clustering. Specifically:

- They propose compressing the Koopman matrix by hierarchically clustering its rows and columns into groups, making elements within each group equal, and taking the average value. This reduces the size of the Koopman matrix.

- They also propose methods to compress the associated dictionaries used with the Koopman matrix. This is necessary since the compressed Koopman matrix is no longer square.

- They introduce an additional "recovery" matrix R to map between the compressed dictionaries and allow repeated application of the compressed Koopman matrix. 

- They demonstrate the proposed compression method on a cart-pole model controlled by a reinforcement learning agent, showing it can greatly reduce computation time while retaining good accuracy compared to the uncompressed Koopman matrix.

- They compare with SVD compression and show their proposed clustering-based compression outperforms SVD in terms of retaining accuracy with similar compression rates.

So in summary, the key contribution is the proposal of using hierarchical clustering to compress the Koopman matrix and associated components to reduce computation costs while preserving good accuracy for physics predictions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Koopman operator theory - A framework to apply linear analysis to nonlinear dynamical systems by considering evolution in an observable function space rather than the state space.

- Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) - A method to approximately construct a finite-dimensional Koopman operator (Koopman matrix) from data. 

- Dictionary functions - Basis functions used in EDMD to express observable functions. Things like monomials and radial basis functions.

- Hierarchical clustering - An unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into a hierarchy based on similarity. Used here to identify redundant rows/columns in the Koopman matrix.  

- Compression ratio - Defined here as the ratio of compressed Koopman matrix dimensions to original dimensions. Quantifies the amount of compression achieved.

- Cart-pole model - A nonlinear dynamical system example used to demonstrate the proposed Koopman matrix compression technique.

- Prediction accuracy - Quantitative evaluation of how accurately the compressed Koopman matrices can predict the future states of the cart-pole model versus the uncompressed original.

- Singular value decomposition (SVD) - A matrix decomposition technique used here as a baseline for comparison. Can compress matrices via low-rank approximation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a 4-step method to compress the Koopman matrix using hierarchical clustering. Can you walk through each step in more detail and explain the key ideas behind them? 

2) How exactly is the hierarchical clustering performed on the Koopman matrix? What distance metric and linkage criteria are used? 

3) When constructing the compressed dictionary functions in Steps 2 and 3, the paper makes an assumption of equality between functions in the same cluster. What is the justification for this assumption and how might it impact the accuracy?

4) Explain the purpose of the additional "recovery" matrix R introduced in Step 4. Why is this matrix necessary when using the compressed Koopman matrix for prediction? 

5) Equations (16) and (17) present two options for applying the compressed Koopman matrix. Discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Why does the paper focus on Equation (17)?

6) The numerical experiments use a cart-pole system controlled by a reinforcement learning model. Discuss why this is a useful test case and what challenges it presents compared to an uncontrolled system.  

7) Analyze the computation time results in Table 1. What trends do you see and what do they imply about the impact of row versus column compression?

8) The accuracy declines substantially when high compression ratios like [0.2, 0.2] are used. Speculate on the reasons for this decline and how it might be mitigated.  

9) Compare and contrast the proposed hierarchical clustering approach to SVD-based compression of the Koopman matrix. Why does hierarchical clustering provide better accuracy?

10) The paper compresses the Koopman matrix but does not modify the underlying dictionary functions. Propose an approach for also compressing the dictionary in conjunction with the Koopman matrix. What difficulties might this present?
