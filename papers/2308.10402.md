# [Simple Baselines for Interactive Video Retrieval with Questions and   Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10402)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can an interactive video retrieval system based on question-answering be developed to substantially enhance video search performance without requiring access to ground truth dialogue data?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A question-answering based interactive retrieval system can effectively simulate user responses and refine an initial text query through iterative interaction. 2) Simple question generators based on heuristics or large language models can elicit useful discriminative information from the user beyond just objects, such as scenes, actions, color, etc.3) Such an interactive retrieval system can generalize effectively to multiple datasets without requiring fine-tuning on human-annotated dialog data.The experiments seem designed to validate these hypotheses by evaluating different question generator approaches on several standard video retrieval benchmarks. The goal is to show significant improvement over non-interactive baselines, indicating the potential of this interactive QA-based retrieval framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a simple yet effective framework for interactive video retrieval based on video question answering. The paper explores different question generator designs within this framework.2. Developing three question generators (heuristic, auto-text, auto-text-vid) that gather discriminative information beyond just objects from the target video, using heuristics or large language models. 3. Demonstrating through experiments that the proposed question-based interactive retrieval system generalizes well to multiple video datasets and significantly improves over non-interactive baselines, without needing any fine-tuning.In summary, the key contribution seems to be presenting a straightforward but high-performing framework for interactive video retrieval utilizing video question answering to simulate user responses. The results highlight the potential for question-based interfaces to substantially improve video search.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes simple and effective baselines using video question answering to simulate user interaction for improving video retrieval through iterative question-answer exchanges.
