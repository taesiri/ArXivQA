# [Hold 'em and Fold 'em: Towards Human-scale, Feedback-Controlled Soft   Origami Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Two key capabilities are needed for soft robotics to achieve broader application in daily life: 1) proprioceptive (on-robot body) feedback control for accurate position/force control and portability, and 2) the ability to actuate human-scale loads. Existing soft actuators generally cannot do both. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents two case studies demonstrating progress towards these goals in soft fluidic origami actuators with the "Kresling" fold pattern. 

In the first case study, they demonstrate closed-loop position control of a single actuator using discrete-time control. The position feedback signal comes from capacitive sensors patterned on the origami folds that sense displacement and are read by compact electronics. This method requires no visual tracking. The controller achieves <4mm RMS error in tracking step setpoints and sine waves.

In the second study, they show three actuators with a total mass of 183g fabricated using the same method can support a 60kg human rider on a central platform. By changing the actuator pressures, they create tilts in the balance board. This demonstrates potential towards using these lightweight actuators in human-assisting devices.

Main Contributions:

1) Optimization of capacitive sensor design for proprioceptive sensing using FEA, achieving improved sensitivity compared to a basic design

2) CAD generation method for easily producing Kresling actuators of varying dimensions 

3) Demonstration of closed-loop position control tracking setpoints using only on-body capacitive sensing, with no visual tracking

4) Demonstration of using three sub-200g soft actuators to manipulate the position of a 60kg human rider. This shows potential for integrating soft robotics with human applications.

The combination of contributions 2-4 helps address the twin goals of proprioceptive control and human-scale loads for soft origami actuators. By detailing the design and methods, the authors aim to provide a basis for other researchers to build on this work. Potential future work could combine the feedback control and human interaction studies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper demonstrates proprioceptive feedback control and support of human-scale loads with lightweight, 3D-printed origami actuators through case studies of accurate position tracking using embedded capacitive sensors and an origami balance board that varies its height, roll, and pitch angle under a person's weight.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating soft, 3D-printed origami actuators with two key capabilities:

1) Proprioceptive feedback control without using visual tracking. The paper shows closed-loop feedback control of the origami actuator's position using only capacitive sensors attached to the actuator itself, without needing external cameras or vision systems. This allows the actuator to reach setpoint states and track sinusoidal trajectories.

2) Ability to support human-scale loads. The paper demonstrates a case study with three lightweight origami actuators (total mass 183.6g) assembled into a balance board that can manipulate and support the weight of a 60kg person. 

In the paper's own words, these demonstrations of proprioceptive control and human-scale load bearing "contribute to the field of soft robotics by demonstrating closed-loop feedback position control without visual tracking as an input and lightweight, soft actuators that can support a person's weight." The combination of these two capabilities moves soft robotics closer to real-world and assistive applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a proprioceptive feedback control method for soft origami actuators using capacitive sensors. How was the relationship between capacitor geometry, fold angle, and capacitance modeled? What optimization approach was used to maximize sensitivity? 

2. The discrete-time control law utilizes proportional and derivative terms (Equation 4). How were the gain values Kp and Kd selected? What other control strategies were attempted and why was discrete-time control preferred?

3. The paper demonstrates controlling actuator position to follow sine wave and step inputs. What are other potential trajectory types that could be tested? How might performance differ for faster trajectories?  

4. What alternate soft sensing modalities could be used instead of or in combination with the capacitive sensors? How would they need to be modeled and integrated into the control scheme?

5. The balance board case study operates the 3 actuators in open loop. How could closed-loop control be implemented for this application? What states would need sensing and control?

6. How was the kinematic model relating fold angle, rotation, and length derived? What assumptions were made and what impacts could violations of those assumptions have on control performance?  

7. What failure modes could occur in the fluidic actuation system? How could the control scheme identify and respond to issues with the pneumatic supply?

8. The paper targets position control. What would be required to demonstrate force control with the same actuator and sensing design?  

9. How was the scaling factor kappa between simulated and measured capacitance determined? How robust is this mapping to variability in fabrication and environment?

10. The balance board supports a 60 kg rider on three actuators. What limits the load capacity? How could the design be modified to support larger loads?
