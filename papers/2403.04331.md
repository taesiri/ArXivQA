# [Control-Barrier-Aided Teleoperation with Visual-Inertial SLAM for Safe   MAV Navigation in Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04331)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of safely teleoperating a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) to navigate unknown and cluttered environments. Specifically, the goal is to ensure the MAV avoids collisions and doesn't enter unmapped areas, even when a human operator sends position references that would cause collisions. This is a challenging problem because it requires performing localization, mapping, and control safely using only the MAV's onboard sensors without any prior knowledge of the environment.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a system that combines visual-inertial SLAM (VI-SLAM), dense 3D occupancy mapping, and a control barrier function (CBF) based safety filter running fully onboard the MAV. The key components are:

- VI-SLAM (using OKVIS2) is used to estimate the MAV's state from visual and inertial measurements.

- A dense volumetric occupancy map of the environment is incrementally constructed using depth images and poses from VI-SLAM. The map explicitly represents free, occupied and unknown space.  

- A truncated Euclidean signed distance field (TESDF) is extracted from the map. The TESDF encodes distance to occupied/unknown space and is used to construct a CBF encoding safe regions.

- A CBF-based quadratic program safety filter modifies the operator's position references when they would violate safety constraints. The filtered references try to match the operator input while satisfying the CBF constraints encoding avoidance of obstacles and unmapped areas.

Contributions:

- Proposes a method to construct a CBF for safe control directly from an incrementally built volumetric map of the environment.

- Demonstrates a fully self-contained system combining VI-SLAM, dense mapping and safe control running onboard an MAV with no external infrastructure.

- Provides extensive simulated and real-world experiments, including complex indoor environments, showing the system allows safe teleoperation using only onboard computation and sensing.

In summary, the key novelty is in closing the loop from perception and mapping to provably safe control on a real MAV relying solely on its onboard sensors and computer.
