# [Control-Barrier-Aided Teleoperation with Visual-Inertial SLAM for Safe   MAV Navigation in Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04331)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of safely teleoperating a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) to navigate unknown and cluttered environments. Specifically, the goal is to ensure the MAV avoids collisions and doesn't enter unmapped areas, even when a human operator sends position references that would cause collisions. This is a challenging problem because it requires performing localization, mapping, and control safely using only the MAV's onboard sensors without any prior knowledge of the environment.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a system that combines visual-inertial SLAM (VI-SLAM), dense 3D occupancy mapping, and a control barrier function (CBF) based safety filter running fully onboard the MAV. The key components are:

- VI-SLAM (using OKVIS2) is used to estimate the MAV's state from visual and inertial measurements.

- A dense volumetric occupancy map of the environment is incrementally constructed using depth images and poses from VI-SLAM. The map explicitly represents free, occupied and unknown space.  

- A truncated Euclidean signed distance field (TESDF) is extracted from the map. The TESDF encodes distance to occupied/unknown space and is used to construct a CBF encoding safe regions.

- A CBF-based quadratic program safety filter modifies the operator's position references when they would violate safety constraints. The filtered references try to match the operator input while satisfying the CBF constraints encoding avoidance of obstacles and unmapped areas.

Contributions:

- Proposes a method to construct a CBF for safe control directly from an incrementally built volumetric map of the environment.

- Demonstrates a fully self-contained system combining VI-SLAM, dense mapping and safe control running onboard an MAV with no external infrastructure.

- Provides extensive simulated and real-world experiments, including complex indoor environments, showing the system allows safe teleoperation using only onboard computation and sensing.

In summary, the key novelty is in closing the loop from perception and mapping to provably safe control on a real MAV relying solely on its onboard sensors and computer.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a control system that combines visual-inertial SLAM, dense 3D mapping, and a control barrier function safety filter running fully onboard a micro aerial vehicle to enable safe teleoperation without collisions in unknown environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a perceptive safety filter framework that integrates Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) with Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VI-SLAM) and dense 3D occupancy mapping for safe teleoperation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Generating a Control Barrier Function (CBF) from an online dense volumetric map constructed in real-time using onboard sensors, directly closing the loop between mapping and control. 

2) Integrating VI-SLAM, dense 3D occupancy mapping, and safe control within an MAV, establishing a self-contained system that operates without the need for external infrastructure.

3) Conducting simulations and real-world experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed perceptive safety filter in ensuring safe teleoperated MAV navigation in complex environments relying solely on onboard sensing and computation.

In contrast to existing perception-based safe control frameworks, this work directly closes the perception-action loop and shows the capability of safe control combined with real-time VI-SLAM without any prior knowledge of the environment or external infrastructure.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Control Barrier Function (CBF) to encode safety constraints. How exactly is the CBF formulated in this work? What map representation is used and how is the CBF extracted from it?

2. The safety filter optimization problem includes a term called "teleoperation input". What does this refer to and what is the purpose of including it in the optimization problem? How does it relate to the overall goal of safe teleoperation?

3. The paper utilizes Visual-Inertial SLAM (VI-SLAM) for state estimation and mapping. Why is VI-SLAM chosen over other SLAM methods? What are the advantages of VI-SLAM for this application?

4. The safety filter runs at a lower rate (6 Hz) compared to the controller rate (60 Hz). What implications does this have? Would running the safety filter at a higher rate improve performance and if so, what hardware limitations prevent this currently?

5. How is the noise term $\epsilon$ in the robustified CBF condition determined? Is there a systematic way to quantify or bound this term? 

6. What modifications need to be made to the formulation to account for the spatial extent of the MAV rather than treating it as a point robot? Would this allow less conservative behavior?

7. The paper demonstrates the approach in simulated and real-world experiments. What additional capabilities would be needed to deploy this system outdoors over larger areas?

8. Could the proposed approach be extended to other types of robots besides quadrotor MAVs? What considerations would be important in doing so?

9. The safety filter adjusts the position references but leaves the yaw reference unmodified. What would be the tradeoffs in also filtering the yaw reference for safety?

10. How well would the proposed approach generalize to dynamic environments? Would the system be able to detect and avoid moving obstacles? What components would need to be added or changed?
