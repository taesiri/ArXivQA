# [AdaBM: On-the-Fly Adaptive Bit Mapping for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03296)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Image super-resolution (SR) models have achieved high-quality image restoration, but require substantial computational resources. Different input images and layers of SR networks have varying sensitivity to quantization errors, so uniformly quantizing all activations wastes computation on easy images and sensitive layers. Existing adaptive quantization methods require expensive training to search bit-allocation policies.

Method: 
This paper proposes an on-the-fly adaptive bit-mapping framework that adapts quantization bit-widths based on input image complexity and layer sensitivity. It formulates the problem with two mapping modules - Image2Bit maps input images to bit-adaptation factors based on complexity thresholds, while Layer2Bit maps layers to factors based on sensitivity thresholds. Bit-mappings are calibrated on a small calibration dataset, avoiding full re-training. Bit-aware clipping then optimizes quantization ranges for each assigned bit.

Contributions:
1) First on-the-fly adaptive quantization method for SR that adapts bit-widths during inference in seconds based on image and layer properties.

2) Formulates problem with just two mapping policies to reduce search cost, calibrating on small dataset without full re-training.

3) Competitive accuracy but x2000 faster processing than previous methods. Pushes adaptive quantization to new efficiency frontier.

4) Visualizes and analyzes layer & image sensitivity properties that enable simplified formulation.

In summary, it accelerates adaptive quantization for SR by calibrating separate image and layer mappings on-the-fly, achieving accuracy comparable to expensive re-training methods within seconds. This facilitates ubiquitous deployment of accurate yet efficient SR models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the first on-the-fly adaptive bit-mapping framework for image super-resolution that adapts quantization bit-widths for different images and layers based on complexity and sensitivity, requiring only a small set of calibration images for calibration and fine-tuning, and achieving comparable performance to previous methods with significantly reduced processing time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first adaptive bit-mapping framework for image super-resolution that adapts the quantization bit-widths for different images and layers on-the-fly during inference. Specifically, the paper formulates the bit allocation problem using two mapping modules - one that maps input images to image-wise bit adaptation factors based on image complexity, and another that maps layers to layer-wise bit adaptation factors based on layer sensitivity. These mappings are calibrated and fine-tuned using only a small set of calibration images without corresponding ground-truths, allowing the framework to accelerate the processing time from hours to seconds compared to prior adaptive quantization methods. The results demonstrate competitive performance but with significantly reduced processing time.

The paper proposes a new framework called "AdaBM" for on-the-fly adaptive bit-mapping to quantize image super-resolution models. The key ideas are using separate image and layer-wise bit adaptation policies mapped based on image complexity and layer sensitivity, calibrating the mappings using a small set of calibration images, and significantly speeding up the processing time compared to prior adaptive quantization methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using image complexity to guide the image-wise bit allocation. What specifically constitutes "image complexity" in this context and how is it calculated? 

2. The layer-wise bit allocation is based on estimating each layer's sensitivity to quantization. What metric is used to estimate the quantization sensitivity of a layer? How is this metric calculated?

3. The paper proposes separate image-wise and layer-wise bit allocation policies to reduce the search space. What is the intuition behind why optimizing these separately is effective? 

4. What approximations are made to the non-differentiable functions during backpropagation to enable end-to-end fine-tuning of the bit allocation policies?

5. The layer-wise bit allocation factors are determined before test time. What are the advantages of pre-computing these offline versus determining them dynamically at test time?

6. What strategies are used to calibrate the initial bit allocation policy thresholds before fine-tuning (e.g. using percentile statistics)? What role does calibration play?

7. How many iterations are used to fine-tune the bit allocation mapping parameters after initialization? What determines convergence and why aren't more iterations used? 

8. The clipping ranges for quantization are made bit-width aware. Why is adjusting the clipping ranges needed when changing the bit-width?

9. What regularization strategy is used during fine-tuning to prevent very high bit-widths from being selected? What role does the regularization loss play?

10. The method uses a small subset of images for calibration and fine-tuning. How sensitive are the results to the sampling strategy used to select this calibration set? How might adaptive sampling help?
