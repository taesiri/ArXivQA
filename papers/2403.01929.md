# [Analyzing and Adapting Large Language Models for Few-Shot Multilingual   NLU: Are We There Yet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01929)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are three main approaches for few-shot learning: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Supervised Instruction Tuning (SIT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). Prior work has not comprehensively analyzed their effectiveness for multilingual NLU across practical metrics like performance, computational costs, latency, etc. 
- Large language models (LLMs) used for ICL are still predominantly English-centric. It's unclear if target language adaptation strategies can improve their capabilities in other languages.

Proposed Solutions and Contributions:

1) Extensive comparison of SFT, SIT and ICL for multilingual NLU:
- Tested on 6 languages, 3 NLU tasks, multiple data sizes and domains
- Analyzed sample efficiency, memory, latency, financial costs
- Key findings:
    - SFT and SIT substantially outperform ICL on performance, while being more efficient
    - Supervised methods reach ICL performance with only 30-100 examples 
    - SIT strikes the best balance between performance vs costs

2) Analysis of target language adaptation for LLMs:  
- Test language generation before/after adaptation (BLEU, ROUGE scores)
- Evaluate language understanding via ICL on XNLI
- Findings: 
    - Adaptation leads to improved fluency but limited coherence/usefulness
    - Almost no gains on actual NLU tasks, significant gaps remain
    - Affirms need for more multilingually-pretrained LLMs

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) an extensive analysis highlighting gaps between ICL and supervised paradigms for multilingual NLU in practice, and (2) evidence that common adaptation strategies fall short of unlocking strong LLM understanding capabilities beyond English.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three few-shot learning approaches (supervised fine-tuning, supervised instruction tuning, and in-context learning) for multilingual NLU across performance, sample efficiency, computational requirements, and cost, finding that supervised methods outperform in-context learning overall while target language adaptation of LLMs only superficially improves generation without boosting understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two main contributions:

1) It provides a comprehensive analysis comparing three learning paradigms for few-shot multilingual NLU: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), supervised instruction tuning (SIT), and in-context learning (ICL). The analysis looks beyond just task performance and also considers practical aspects like data efficiency, computational requirements, inference costs, and financial costs. The key finding is that SFT and SIT substantially outperform ICL on these metrics.  

2) The paper analyzes the impact of target language adaptation techniques like QLoRA on the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of large language models. The main finding is that while adaptation can superficially improve generation fluency in the target language, actual language understanding assessed through ICL shows little to no improvement, especially for low-resource languages. This suggests that current adaptation strategies are not enough to unlock strong multilingual capabilities.

In summary, the paper provides a thorough practical comparison of learning paradigms for multilingual NLU, and shows that LLMs still have major limitations in understanding languages beyond English even after adaptation.
