# [Credence: Augmenting Datacenter Switch Buffer Sharing with ML   Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Packet buffers in datacenter switches are shared across ports to improve overall throughput. However, buffer sizes are shrinking while traffic is increasingly bursty at microsecond timescales. This makes buffer sharing extremely challenging.
- Existing buffer sharing algorithms have limitations:
   - Drop-tail algorithms proactively drop packets unnecessarily in anticipation of future bursts. This causes throughput loss.  
   - Drop-tail algorithms also reactively drop packets when buffer is full, incurring more throughput loss.
   - Push-out algorithms can overcome these issues but are not supported in switches.
- Fundamental barrier for drop-tail algorithms is the lack of visibility into future packet arrivals.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Credence, the first buffer sharing algorithm augmented with machine learned predictions to unlock performance of push-out algorithms.
- Credence relies on predictions to emulate push-out operations using a drop-tail buffer. It closely follows the Longest Queue Drop (LQD) push-out algorithm.
- With perfect predictions, Credence matches LQD's optimal performance. With high error, Credence guarantees minimum performance similar to basic Complete Sharing algorithm.
- As prediction error grows, Credence's performance smoothly degrades between optimal and minimum.

Main Contributions:
- Credence unlocks near-optimal buffer sharing performance using predictions, gracefully handling prediction errors.
- Evaluations using datacenter workloads show Credence improves throughput by 1.5x and flow completion times by up to 95% over state-of-the-art.
- Paper opens exciting research directions at intersection of systems and theory to further improve prediction-augmented buffer sharing.

In summary, the paper addresses limitations of drop-tail buffer sharing using predictions to emulate push-out algorithms. This unlocks significant performance gains while handling prediction errors smoothly. The paper lays groundwork for integrating predictions with buffer sharing in datacenter networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Credence, the first buffer sharing algorithm for datacenter switches that is augmented with machine-learned predictions to achieve near-optimal performance given accurate predictions while guaranteeing minimum performance even with inaccurate predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Credence, the first buffer sharing algorithm for datacenter network switches that is augmented with machine-learned predictions. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Credence leverages predictions to emulate push-out buffer sharing algorithms using simple drop-tail buffers available in switches. This unlocks the performance that was previously only possible with complex push-out algorithms.

- Credence achieves near-optimal performance with perfect predictions, guaranteeing performance similar to the best known push-out algorithm LQD. 

- Even with arbitrarily inaccurate predictions, Credence guarantees a minimum performance similar to the simplest existing drop-tail algorithm Complete Sharing.

- The performance of Credence smoothly degrades between near-optimal to minimum guarantee as the prediction error grows. This property is referred to as "smoothness" in the paper.

- Extensive evaluations using realistic workloads show that Credence improves throughput by 1.5x and reduces flow completion times by up to 95% compared to existing approaches.

In summary, the main contribution is the design and analysis of Credence, the first prediction-augmented buffer sharing algorithm that unlocks near-optimal performance by overcoming fundamental limitations of drop-tail buffers in datacenter switches.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using machine learning predictions to augment traditional drop-tail buffer sharing algorithms. What are some of the key challenges or limitations of existing drop-tail algorithms that predictions could help address?

4. How exactly does the threshold update procedure allow the algorithm to "follow" the longest queue drop algorithm? What would happen if the thresholds were updated differently?

5. The safeguard condition that overrides the predictions is vital for ensuring robustness. What would be the consequences of not having this safeguard, especially with inaccurate predictions?

6. What factors need to be considered when training a machine learning model to produce the drop predictions needed by the algorithm? How might the choice of model impact performance?

7. The paper considers predictions at the granularity of individual packets. What are some pros and cons of making predictions at different granularities?

8. How sensitive is the performance to the accuracy of identifying the single longest queue? What approximations could reduce this complexity?

9. The competitive analysis compares against an optimal offline algorithm. How could the concept of consistency be adapted to compare against the best possible online algorithm?

10. What modifications would need to be made to apply this prediction-augmentation approach to other buffer sharing algorithms besides drop-tail?
