# [An Encoding Framework for Binarized Images using HyperDimensional   Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00454)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel light-weight framework for encoding binarized images using only native hyperdimensional computing (HDC) vector operations. The key ideas are using point of interest (POI) selection to extract local features, encoding these local patches around each POI, and capturing the global position of POIs via a new positional mapping technique called local linear mapping. Compared to traditional linear mapping of positions, local linear mapping emphasizes small positional differences while ignoring large ones. The encoding method is evaluated on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.35% and 84.12% respectively among native HDC techniques. It also demonstrates higher robustness to noise and blur corruptions than baseline HDC encoding. The proposed framework provides a strong native HDC approach for image classification without reliance on external feature extraction methods. Key innovations are the local linear mapping for positional encoding and a parameterized framework unifying existing HDC image encodings. Results match more complex hybrid HDC models and showcase the potential of native HDC for computer vision tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new hyperdimensional computing framework for encoding binarized images that uses point of interest selection and local linear mapping of positions to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST and improved robustness to noise and blur.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introduction of "local linear mapping" as a novel mapping method for numeric data, where nearby numerical values are represented by similar hyperdimensional vectors and other values by orthogonal vectors. It also demonstrates the application of local linear mapping for encoding positions in 2D images.  

2) Definition of a parameterized framework for encoding binary images into hyperdimensional vectors using point of interest (POI) selection as a local feature extraction method. This framework unifies existing approaches for native hyperdimensional computing encoding of images.

3) Application of the proposed framework on benchmark datasets MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, achieving classification accuracies of 97.35% and 84.12% respectively. These results outperform other baseline hyperdimensional computing models with different encoding approaches and are comparable to more complex hybrid models.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed encoding framework for binarized images relying only on native hyperdimensional arithmetic operations, using local linear mapping and point of interest selection. This demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to other baseline methods.
