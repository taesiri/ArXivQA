# [Mitigating analytical variability in fMRI results with style transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is high variability in fMRI analysis pipelines, which makes combining results across studies challenging. This limits the potential to leverage large shared data repositories for meta/mega-analyses. 
- Existing image-to-image translation methods like GANs and DDPMs show promise for converting between modalities, but have not been explored for converting between analysis pipelines.

Proposed Solution:
- Make the assumption that pipelines are an "extrinsic style" property of fMRI statistic maps that can be transferred between maps while preserving the "intrinsic content".
- Propose a new unsupervised multi-domain DDPM framework (CCDDPM) to convert statistic maps between pipelines by conditioning on latent features from a pipeline classifier. 
- Improve sampling by:
   - Fixing the DDPM initial state to a noisy version of the source image to preserve content
   - Conditioning on multiple target images selected by k-means clustering to capture diversity
- Compare CCDDPM to baseline DDPMs and a 3D StarGAN on converting maps between 4 analysis pipelines.

Main Contributions:
- First work exploring the concept of pipelines as a style property for transfer between fMRI maps.
- New conditional DDPM method with classifier conditioning and multi-image target sampling.
- Demonstrate that maps can be successfully converted between pipelines, although GANs still achieve higher similarity to target maps.
- CCDDPM generates maps with improved quality and diversity compared to baseline DDPMs.
- Framework is unsupervised and could leverage large unlabeled fMRI databases.

The key idea is that generative image translation methods show promise for converting fMRI statistic maps between analysis pipelines seen as an "extrinsic style", while preserving the "intrinsic content" of the maps. The proposed CCDDPM method outperforms baseline DDPMs in quality and diversity of converted outputs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel unsupervised multi-domain diffusion model framework to convert fMRI statistic maps across pipelines by making the assumption that pipelines can be considered extrinsic properties that can be transferred between maps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Making the assumption that pipelines can be considered as extrinsic properties of statistic maps and can be transferred between maps. 

2) Extending previous methods to build a classifier-conditional DDPM (CCDDPM) in an unsupervised multi-domain transition framework to convert between multiple pipelines using a single model.

3) Conditioning the CCDDPM using the latent space of a classifier trained to distinguish statistic maps between pipelines.

4) Proposing a new sampling strategy by selecting multiple target samples using a clustering approach to improve both transfer of target domain features while maintaining source image properties.

5) Comparing CCDDPM to simpler DDPM models and also to a state-of-the-art multi-domain image-to-image transition model (StarGAN) implemented in 3D. Evaluating and comparing the performance of each competitor on a broad set of metrics.

In summary, the main contribution is the development of a new unsupervised multi-domain DDPM framework (CCDDPM) for converting fMRI statistic maps across pipelines by making pipelines an extrinsic property that can be transferred.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to use diffusion models for unsupervised multi-domain image-to-image transition. What are the key advantages of using diffusion models over other generative models like GANs for this task?

2. The method conditions the diffusion model using the latent space of a classifier. Why is conditioning on the latent space better than using a one-hot encoded label for the class? How does it help capture more variability in the target domain?

3. The paper samples multiple target images using k-means clustering to condition the diffusion model. Explain the rationale behind using multiple target images versus a single image. How does it help the model generate more diverse and representative images? 

4. The initial state of the diffusion model is set to a noisy version of the source image. Explain why this strategy is used and how it helps preserve intrinsic properties of the source image during image translation.

5. What is the classifier-conditional diffusion model (CCDDPM) and how is it different from a regular conditional diffusion model? Explain the training process and conditioning method used in CCDDPM.

6. The paper compares CCDDPM to simpler diffusion models and StarGAN. Analyze and discuss the key differences between these models in terms of architecture, loss functions and training strategies. 

7. The performance of StarGAN is better than CCDDPM in some metrics like correlation with ground truth images. What factors contribute to this superiority of StarGAN over diffusion models?

8. How is the reverse diffusion process designed to convert images iteratively from the source to the target domain? Explain the noise prediction and image reconstruction steps. 

9. What sampling strategies did the paper explore to select the target images for conditioning CCDDPM? How did the performance vary with different selection schemes?

10. The performance of all models was lower for pipelines with similar software or HRF models. What reasons may explain why translation becomes harder for more similar analysis pipelines?
