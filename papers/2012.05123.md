# [The Counterfactual NESS Definition of Causation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05123)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Defining actual causation (token causation) is an important and challenging problem in philosophy and computer science. Two major approaches are the counterfactual approach and the Necessary Element of a Sufficient Set (NESS) approach. These are often claimed to be opposed to each other. 
- Existing attempts to formalize the NESS definition using structural equation models have failed to capture it correctly.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides a new formalization of the NESS definition using structural equation models that captures it accurately. 
- It shows that the previously proposed definition by Beckers and Vennekens (BV) integrates the NESS approach with a counterfactual difference-making condition, contrary to claims about their opposition.
- It modifies the BV definition to avoid problems in analyzing some preemption cases, resulting in the Counterfactual NESS (CNESS) definition.

Main Contributions:
- Correct formalization of the NESS definition using structural equation models
- Demonstration that the BV definition combines the NESS approach with a counterfactual condition 
- Introduction of the CNESS definition that avoids problems of the BV definition in some preemption cases
- Showing that the NESS and counterfactual approaches are not necessarily opposed as often claimed
- Providing a definition (CNESS) that integrates two major approaches to actual causation

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards defining actual causation by formally integrating two influential approaches, analyzing their connections, and providing an improved definition. The CNESS definition of causation combines elements of both counterfactual and regularity/NESS approaches.
