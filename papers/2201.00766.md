# [Class-Incremental Continual Learning into the eXtended DER-verse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on continual learning, where models need to learn sequentially from a stream of data distributions without forgetting previously learned knowledge. The authors identify two key issues with their previous method called Dark Experience Replay (DER):

1) DER replays past model responses stored when examples are added to the memory buffer. However, it misses out on capturing additional information about relationships between old and new classes that is learned later on. 

2) DER suffers from accumulating bias towards more recent classes seen. This causes degradation in recognizing old classes.

Proposed Solution - eXtended DER (X-DER):

To address issue 1, X-DER implants updated responses for previous examples into the memory when new related information becomes available later. This keeps refreshing the memory buffer to retain richer information over time.

For issue 2, X-DER changes the cross-entropy loss to only train on current classes, avoiding penalization of outputs for past classes. Additional constraints are added so activations do not grow unchecked for old classes.

A future preparation technique is introduced - contrastive self-supervision and distillation losses are imposed on unused future heads. This warm-starts these heads to expected data distributions, easing later adaptation.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes X-DER that outperforms prior state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100, miniImageNet and a new Split NTU-60 benchmark through memory updating and future preparation.

- Provides analysis showing X-DER captures richer secondary information, attains flatter minima and calibrates better by approximating Bayes class probabilities.

- Evaluates model explanation quality - X-DER focuses better on foreground evidence, retains reasoning capabilities over time and encodes information on secondary image regions.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in overcoming limitations of prior rehearsal-based continual learning and analyzing model behaviors through different evaluation perspectives. The proposed X-DER method consistently outperforms existing techniques on multiple image classification benchmarks.
