# [GazeMotion: Gaze-guided Human Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for human motion forecasting typically only use past body poses as input to predict future motion. However, studies in behavioral sciences have shown that human eye gaze and body movements are closely coordinated during daily activities. This important information has not been explored for human motion forecasting. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel gaze-guided motion forecasting method called "GazeMotion" that combines past body poses and eye gaze to predict future motion. The key components are:

1) A CNN to predict future eye gaze from past gaze. 

2) A gaze-pose fusion method to fuse the predicted future gaze and past poses into a gaze-pose graph. 

3) A residual graph convolutional network with novel spatial-temporal modules that takes the gaze-pose graph as input and outputs future body poses.

Main Contributions:

1) A new gaze-guided framework for human motion forecasting that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 7.4% in terms of prediction error on three datasets.

2) Demonstration that incorporating predicted future gaze significantly improves performance compared to using past gaze or not using gaze at all.

3) Using head direction as a proxy for eye gaze increases applicability. The method still outperforms prior arts by 5.5% on average when using head direction instead of gaze.

4) An online user study validating that the predicted motions are more precise and realistic compared to prior arts.

The paper reveals the usefulness of eye gaze for motion forecasting and provides an effective framework to exploit this extra information. The gaze prediction component increases applicability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new method for human motion forecasting called GazeMotion that combines past body poses with predicted future eye gaze directions using a convolutional neural network for gaze prediction and a residual graph convolutional network architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance in motion forecasting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1) The paper proposes a novel method for human motion forecasting that first predicts future eye gaze from past gaze, fuses the predicted future gaze and past body poses into a gaze-pose graph, and then forecasts future body poses using a residual graph convolutional network. 

2) The paper reports extensive experiments on three public datasets for motion forecasting at different future time horizons. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. The paper also validates through a user study that the predictions of the proposed method are more precise and realistic than prior methods.

3) The paper introduces using head direction as a proxy for eye gaze when gaze information is not available. This increases the applicability of the method while still achieving significantly better performance than prior methods.

In summary, the main contributions are: 1) a novel gaze-guided motion forecasting method, 2) extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validating improvements over the state-of-the-art, and 3) the idea of using head direction as a gaze proxy to increase applicability.
