# [Spatio-Temporal Crop Aggregation for Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17042)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we develop an efficient and scalable approach to learn good video representations in a self-supervised manner?

In particular, the authors aim to propose a method that:

- Is highly efficient and scalable in terms of computation and memory requirements compared to prior self-supervised video representation learning approaches. 

- Can effectively learn from unlabeled videos by exploiting the spatio-temporal structure of videos through novel self-supervised pretext tasks.

- Improves upon existing pretrained backbones by learning better global and local video representations.

- Achieves strong transfer performance on downstream action recognition tasks through linear evaluation as well as nonlinear evaluation protocols.

The key hypothesis seems to be that by combining principles of input sparsity, output sparsity, dimensionality reduction, and leveraging a pretrained backbone, along with the proposed pretext tasks of masked clip modeling and contrastive set modeling, their method can lead to significant improvements in efficiency, scalability and effectiveness of self-supervised video representation learning.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop a video representation learning approach that is highly efficient and scalable yet also effective in building useful spatio-temporal video representations for action recognition in a self-supervised manner. The proposed SCALE method aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes SCALE (Spatio-temporal Crop Aggregation for video representation LEarning), a novel and highly scalable video representation learning method. 

- The method works by extracting clips from a video, getting clip-level features from a frozen pretrained backbone, and then training a model to refine the features and aggregate them into a global video representation.

- Two novel self-supervised pretext tasks are proposed for training: Masked Clip Modeling (MCM) to refine each clip's features, and a contrastive loss to make the global features invariant to the set of clips.

- The method incorporates input sparsity, output sparsity, dimensionality reduction, and a pretrained backbone to make the training very efficient.

- Experiments show SCALE gives significant performance improvements in linear probing, nonlinear probing, and kNN retrieval across various action classification datasets when added on top of state-of-the-art backbones.

- The method is highly scalable, achieving better results than other methods that require orders of magnitude more computation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an efficient and scalable self-supervised method to learn improved video representations by training on top of a pretrained frozen backbone using multiple video clips. The method gives state-of-the-art video representation quality with minimal computational requirements.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes SCALE, a novel self-supervised learning method for video representation learning. SCALE trains on sets of sparse video clip features from a frozen pretrained backbone to produce an improved global video representation. The key ideas are input sparsity, output sparsity, dimensionality reduction via a pretrained backbone, and training with contrastive masked modeling and invariant feature learning on clip sets. The method achieves state-of-the-art video representation learning with high computational efficiency.
