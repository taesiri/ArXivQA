# [Spatio-Temporal Crop Aggregation for Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17042)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we develop an efficient and scalable approach to learn good video representations in a self-supervised manner?

In particular, the authors aim to propose a method that:

- Is highly efficient and scalable in terms of computation and memory requirements compared to prior self-supervised video representation learning approaches. 

- Can effectively learn from unlabeled videos by exploiting the spatio-temporal structure of videos through novel self-supervised pretext tasks.

- Improves upon existing pretrained backbones by learning better global and local video representations.

- Achieves strong transfer performance on downstream action recognition tasks through linear evaluation as well as nonlinear evaluation protocols.

The key hypothesis seems to be that by combining principles of input sparsity, output sparsity, dimensionality reduction, and leveraging a pretrained backbone, along with the proposed pretext tasks of masked clip modeling and contrastive set modeling, their method can lead to significant improvements in efficiency, scalability and effectiveness of self-supervised video representation learning.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop a video representation learning approach that is highly efficient and scalable yet also effective in building useful spatio-temporal video representations for action recognition in a self-supervised manner. The proposed SCALE method aims to address this question.
