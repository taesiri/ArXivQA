# [Mysterious Projections: Multimodal LLMs Gain Domain-Specific Visual   Capabilities Without Richer Cross-Modal Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as LLaVA and GPT-V enable conversing with images using natural language. However, off-the-shelf MLLMs have limited capabilities with domain-specific images like those from agriculture or dermatology. 
- A common architecture for MLLMs consists of two main modules: (1) a cross-modal projection network that maps images into the language model's space, and (2) a large language model (LLM) that processes the text and projected image jointly. It is important to understand the roles of these two modules in modeling domain-specific visual attributes.

Proposed Approach:
- Fine-tune LLaVA-1.5 using two methods: (1) only updating the cross-modal projection with LLM frozen, (2) updating the entire model.
- Evaluate domain-specific image classification performance on 4 specialized datasets. 
- Estimate the richness of domain-specific visual attributes in the post-projection image representations.
- Analyze the results to understand the roles of the projection and LLM in modeling domain-specific image attributes.

Key Contributions:
- Findings show that both fine-tuning approaches improve the domain-specific visual capabilities. However, the updates do NOT lead to the projection capturing more relevant domain-specific visual attributes.
- This indicates the domain-specific attributes are predominantly modeled by the LLM parameters, even when the projection alone is updated.
- The work reinterprets the role of cross-modal projections in MLLMs - projections may help direct pre-existing knowledge in LM, rather than extracting visual attributes.
- Results add evidence that deep neural networks can inherently be multimodal, with LLMs able to model visual data with minimal help from explicit projections.

In summary, the key contribution is providing evidence that the LLM itself models domain-specific visual attributes in MLLMs, challenging the notion that cross-modal projections play a central role. This offers a potential reinterpretation of projection's purpose in MLLM architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper finds that as multimodal large language models gain domain-specific visual capabilities through fine-tuning, the cross-modal projections do not necessarily extract richer domain-specific visual features, indicating that domain-specific visual attributes may be modeled predominantly within the language model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper finds that as multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA are fine-tuned to gain domain-specific visual capabilities on datasets from agriculture, textures, dermatology, etc., the cross-modal projection layer does not necessarily extract richer domain-specific visual features. Specifically, the paper shows that when only the projection layer is fine-tuned or the entire MLLM is fine-tuned end-to-end, the domain-specific richness of the post-projection image representation declines, even though the MLLM's domain-specific visual classification performance improves. 

Through experiments across multiple datasets and analysis using independent classifiers, the paper makes a case that the domain-specific visual attributes are modeled by the large language model, whether the LLM parameters are frozen or updated during fine-tuning. In other words, the paper argues that the role of the cross-modal projection in modeling domain-specific visual attributes in MLLMs is limited. The paper discusses the implications of these findings and situates them in the context of recent work showing multimodal capabilities of frozen LLM parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is the evidence indicating that domain-specific visual attributes are predominantly modeled by the LLM parameters in MLLMs, not necessarily the cross-modal projection, challenging common notions of the role of projections.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
- Cross-modal projections
- Domain-specific visual capabilities 
- Fine-tuning strategies
- Frozen vs fine-tuned language model parameters
- Post-projection image representations
- Domain-specific richness
- Interpretability of neural networks
- Multimodal neurons

The paper examines strategies for improving the domain-specific visual capabilities of multimodal large language models through fine-tuning. It analyzes whether fine-tuning leads to richer, more domain-relevant representations after the cross-modal projection layer. The key finding is that domain-specific visual attributes are modeled by the language model itself, not necessarily obtained from richer projections. This relates to the notion of multimodal neurons and the interpretability of how neural networks acquire multimodal reasoning abilities. Overall the main focus is on analyzing the roles of different components of MLLMs in modeling visual attributes after specialization to new domains.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two different fine-tuning strategies for adapting a multimodal LLM (MLLM) to gain domain-specific visual capabilities - fine-tuning just the projection layer vs end-to-end fine-tuning. What are the potential trade-offs between these two approaches in terms of computational efficiency, model interpretability, and performance? 

2. The authors use an independent MLP classifier trained on the post-projection embeddings to estimate the domain-specific richness of those embeddings. What are some alternative ways this could be estimated? What are the relative pros and cons?

3. The results indicate that fine-tuning, while improving domain-specific visual capabilities, does not necessarily improve domain-specific richness of the post-projection embeddings. What does this suggest about where domain-specific visual attributes are being modeled within the MLLM architecture?

4. If domain-specific visual attributes are being predominantly modeled by the LLM parameters rather than through richer projections, what design implications might this have for future MLLMs intended for domain specialization?

5. The paper analyzes one MLLM architecture (LLaVA-1.5). How might the roles of the projection vs LLM parameters differ in other MLLM architectures like FLAMINGO or InstructBLIP? 

6. The authors suggest their findings add evidence that LLMs could model visual data without much assistance from cross-modal projections. What is the existing evidence for this? How does this study extend that evidence?

7. The paper focuses on a closed-set image classification task. Would we expect different results if the domain-specific task involved open-ended generation conditioned on images instead? Why or why not?

8. What types of layer- and neuron-level analysis could further elucidate where domain-specific visual attributes are being modeled within the LLM? What challenges might this analysis face?

9. Beyond classification performance, what other metrics could be used to evaluate the domain-specific visual capabilities gained via fine-tuning? How might a more holistic evaluation modify the conclusions?

10. The paper acknowledges biases in existing LLMs that could be inherited by domain-adapted variants. What proactive steps could be taken during the domain adaptation process to mitigate propagation of those biases?
