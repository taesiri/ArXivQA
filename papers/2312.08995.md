# [FrameFinder: Explorative Multi-Perspective Framing Extraction from News   Headlines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08995)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents FrameFinder, a novel tool for extracting and analyzing frames in textual data from multiple perspectives. Frames refer to the selection and emphasis of certain aspects in a text to promote a specific interpretation. The tool takes text as input and uses Transformer models to generate representations of the framing from three distinct perspectives: (1) frame labels, which classify the text into predetermined categories, (2) frame dimensions, which quantify the text's alignment with opposing concepts like harm versus care, and (3) frame structure, which visually depicts semantic relationships between concepts in the text. The tool aggregates and visualizes the results across multiple texts to allow for analysis of corpus-level framing. The authors demonstrate FrameFinder on a corpus of gun violence news headlines, revealing issue framing centered around security and harm rather than health, with notable emphasis on victim names. FrameFinder aims to support social science researchers in exploratory framing analysis without requiring manual coding or annotations. The authors advocate for integrating such tools into information retrieval systems to enable more balanced consumption of biased media.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Revealing framing biases in news articles is an important yet challenging task. Existing approaches rely on limited annotated datasets to train classifiers, which fails to provide deeper understanding of how frames are constructed. There is a need for tools that can help analyze framing in an exploratory manner without relying solely on classifications.

Proposed Solution - FrameFinder:
The paper proposes FrameFinder, an open tool to extract and analyze frames in text from three perspectives:

1) Frame Labels: Predicts pre-defined frame labels (e.g. security, health) in a zero-shot manner to classify which frames are invoked.

2) Frame Dimensions: Analyzes moral biases by projecting text embeddings onto antagonistic axes (e.g. harm/care) to quantify frame intensity and direction. 

3) Frame Structure: Uses abstract meaning representations to construct semantic graphs, revealing relations between key concepts.

The tool is customizable and generates visualizations to support analysis. An online demo is provided to make it accessible.

Analysis and Contributions:
The tool is demonstrated on the gun violence frame corpus. Key observations include:
- Security frame is predominant, not health
- Headlines focus on harm rather than care
- Victims' names are structural focal points  

The analysis shows FrameFinder can provide additional insights compared to traditional annotations. Key contributions include:
- A new tool for computational framing analysis 
- Multi-perspective analysis without manual labeling
- Online access for researchers and public
- Analysis revealing extended insights on an existing corpus

The work calls for integrating framing detection into information retrieval to account for media biases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents FrameFinder, an open tool for extracting and visually representing frames in textual data from three perspectives - frame labels, frame dimensions, and frame structure - to support exploratory analysis of media framing and bias.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is the presentation of FrameFinder, which is described as "an open tool for extracting and analyzing frames in textual data". Specifically, FrameFinder has the following key characteristics that represent its main contributions:

1) It visually represents the frames in text from three perspectives: 
(i) frame labels 
(ii) frame dimensions
(iii) frame structure

2) It demonstrates the ability to analyze framing in the gun violence frame corpus, revealing insights like the discussion being framed more as a security rather than health issue, despite victims being a major structural element. 

3) It is openly available both as an online demonstration and a Python library. This allows social science researchers and novice users to analyze framing of texts without needing technical skills.

4) The authors advocate for incorporating framing analysis directly into information retrieval systems for online news consumption. This could help mitigate media bias by informing users or adapting ranking of search results.

In summary, the main contribution is the presentation of an explorative multi-perspective framing extraction tool called FrameFinder, which is shown to provide valuable insights and is also openly available to support further research.

The goal is to support social science framing research and eventually integrate framing analysis into information retrieval systems to counter media bias.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a multi-perspective approach to framing extraction. What are the three distinct perspectives explored in this work and how do they complement each other in analyzing frames?

2. FrameFinder utilizes Transformer models for its analysis. What specific Transformer models are used for each of the three perspectives and why were they selected? 

3. The paper demonstrates the tool on the Gun Violence Frame Corpus (GVFC). What are some key observations from the framing analysis on this corpus? How do the discovered frames compare to the annotated labels in GVFC?

4. The paper argues that FrameFinder can support social science research. In what ways can this tool assist qualitative researchers in fields like communication studies or sociology? What are some limitations in adopting such automatic frame detection tools?

5. The online demonstration uses HuggingFace and Gradio for deployment. What computational resources are allocated for the demo? How could the interface be extended to allow further customization for users?

6. Frame labels are extracted using a zero-shot classification approach. What are some challenges with typical supervised framing detection? How does the zero-shot method aim to address these?

7. For frame dimensions, the FrameAxis method is utilized. How does it quantify frame bias and intensity? What encoding model is used for alignment scoring?

8. Abstract meaning representations (AMR) are used to analyze frame structure. What are some of the benefits of using AMR over other semantic analysis methods like semantic role labeling?

9. The paper suggests integrating framing analysis into information retrieval. What are some potential ways frames could be used to improve retrieval of online news and make it more balanced?

10. Media bias and framing effects have psychological influences. The paper cites some examples - what other impacts could automated framing analysis have on user attitudes and behaviors in online media consumption?
