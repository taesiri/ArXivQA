# [FrameFinder: Explorative Multi-Perspective Framing Extraction from News   Headlines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08995)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents FrameFinder, a novel tool for extracting and analyzing frames in textual data from multiple perspectives. Frames refer to the selection and emphasis of certain aspects in a text to promote a specific interpretation. The tool takes text as input and uses Transformer models to generate representations of the framing from three distinct perspectives: (1) frame labels, which classify the text into predetermined categories, (2) frame dimensions, which quantify the text's alignment with opposing concepts like harm versus care, and (3) frame structure, which visually depicts semantic relationships between concepts in the text. The tool aggregates and visualizes the results across multiple texts to allow for analysis of corpus-level framing. The authors demonstrate FrameFinder on a corpus of gun violence news headlines, revealing issue framing centered around security and harm rather than health, with notable emphasis on victim names. FrameFinder aims to support social science researchers in exploratory framing analysis without requiring manual coding or annotations. The authors advocate for integrating such tools into information retrieval systems to enable more balanced consumption of biased media.
