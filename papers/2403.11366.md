## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scaling of large language models (LLMs) for retrieval-augmented tasks like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) faces significant memory constraints, especially when fine-tuning with long prompt sequences. 
- Current libraries support model parallelism for inference and full-model fine-tuning but lack efficient parameter distribution needed for retrieved contexts.
- This limits the feasibility of fine-tuning large LLMs for complex RAG applications, particularly on systems with limited GPUs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce JORA - a framework for efficient fine-tuning of Llama-2 models using distributed training.
- Uses JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and tensor sharding for optimized resource management.
- Accelerates fine-tuning and reduces memory requirements compared to existing libraries.
- Significantly improves scalability and feasibility of fine-tuning large LLMs for RAG, even with limited GPUs.

Main Contributions:
- Provides first framework tailored for fine-tuning Llama-2 models with tensor parallelism.
- Leverages JAX optimizations like JIT and tensor sharding to enable faster, lower-memory training.
- Shows 12x speedup over HuggingFace implementation with 4 GPUs while using less than half the VRAM per GPU.  
- Includes data loading and model conversion utilities to simplify training workflow.
- Makes parameter-efficient fine-tuning more accessible for large LLMs, opening applications in RAG.

In summary, the paper presents JORA, a novel framework that utilizes JAX and tensor parallelism to significantly improve memory efficiency, speed and scalability of fine-tuning large language models for retrieval augmented generation compared to existing libraries.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces JORA, a JAX-based library for efficient and scalable retrieval-augmented fine-tuning of large language models like Llama-2 by leveraging techniques like low-rank adaptation, JAX's just-in-time compilation, and tensor sharding for reduced memory usage and faster training times.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of JORA, a novel framework for efficient and scalable fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama-2 in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings. Specifically:

- JORA is designed to enhance the fine-tuning process for RAG applications by leveraging JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and innovative tensor-sharding techniques. This allows for accelerated fine-tuning with reduced memory requirements.

- JORA facilitates the scaling of LLMs for retrieval-based tasks by efficiently distributing memory usage across GPU resources using tensor parallelism. This helps alleviate the memory constraints posed by extensive prompt sequences in RAG.

- Experiments show JORA delivers over 12x speedup compared to Hugging Face/DeepSpeed implementation on 4 GPUs while consuming less than half the VRAM per GPU.

- JORA provides an easy-to-use API and utilities for data loading, model training, conversion to Hugging Face formats, etc. to simplify retrieval augmented fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing an efficient, scalable framework to unlock the potential of large LLMs for more complex RAG applications by addressing key bottlenecks like memory constraints.
