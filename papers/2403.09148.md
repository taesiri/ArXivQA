# [Evaluating LLMs for Gender Disparities in Notable Persons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being used for information retrieval, but there are concerns about their propensity to produce factually incorrect "hallucinated" responses or decline to answer questions altogether.  
- Little research has examined potential gender biases in LLMs' responses to factual queries. Given known gender disparities in representations of notable persons online, it's important to evaluate if LLMs exhibit similar biases.

Methods:
- Evaluated gender differences in accuracy, hallucination rates, and declination rates of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across 3 datasets of notable persons (entrepreneurs, Nobel prize winners, Oscar winners).   
- Introduced new metric called Response Concentration Score (RCS) to measure how representative the gender distribution of LLM responses is compared to true distribution.
- Analyzed the influence of gender associations in prompts on hallucination rates.

Key Findings:
- GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in accuracy but did not eliminate all gender disparities. Some differences in declination rates and hallucinations remained.
- According to RCS, GPT-4 responses better reflected true gender distribution than GPT-3.5. 
- Gender associations in prompts (e.g. industry for entrepreneurs) impacted hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 but not GPT-4.
- Male names predominately generated as more names returned, indicating homogeneity in hallucinated responses.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluated multiple dimensions of gender fairness in LLC responses - accuracy, hallucinations, declinations
- Introduced new metric, RCS, to measure representativeness of response gender distribution 
- Demonstrated influence of gender associations in prompts on hallucination tendencies
- Highlighted remaining disparities in state-of-the-art LLM


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates gender disparities in the factual recall of notable persons by large language models, finding improvements with GPT-4 but some persistent gaps, and proposes a new metric to assess the representativeness of generated responses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It evaluates gender disparities in the factual accuracy of GPT language models' responses to prompts about notable persons. It examines patterns across different tasks and model versions.

2. It introduces a new fairness evaluation measure called the Response Concentration Score (RCS) to assess how representative the distribution of names in LLM responses is compared to the actual distribution. 

3. It investigates factors that may contribute to gendered factual inaccuracies, including the influence of gender associations in prompts and patterns in the co-occurrence of gendered names in hallucinated responses. 

4. It provides evidence that performance improvements from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 have reduced but not eliminated gender disparities in factual accuracy and name distributions.

In summary, the main contribution is a multi-faceted evaluation of gender disparities in the factuality of GPT language models using new and existing fairness metrics, along with an analysis of potential sources of persistent biases.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it are:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)

The paper evaluates gender disparities in the factuality of LLM responses when retrieving information about notable persons, introduces new fairness metrics tailored for generative models, and probes factors like the gender associations in prompts that could contribute to biased outputs. Key terms reflect this focus on examining biases and fairness around factuality, entities, and gender in LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called Response Concentration Score (RCS) to evaluate the fairness of generative models. How is RCS calculated and what are the advantages of using this metric over existing fairness metrics like demographic parity difference?

2. The paper evaluates factuality along multiple dimensions - recall, hallucinations and declinations. What specific metrics are used to quantify performance along each of these dimensions and what do they indicate about the model's capabilities? 

3. The prompts designed for the entrepreneurs task contain information about company name and industry. How do the authors analyze the gender associations of these prompt features and their potential influence on the gender distribution in the model's responses?

4. The paper finds that as the number of founder names generated by the models increases, the percentage of female names decreases, indicating homogeneity. What visualizations best showcase this trend and what theories do the authors propose to explain this behavior?

5. For the Nobel Prize task, what differences do the authors find in the gender distribution of generated names across subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine etc.? How do they account for these differences?

6. The declination rates for male and female founders are found to be different. What metrics are used to compare declination rates by gender and what results do the authors report? What hypotheses emerge from these findings?

7. The authors analyze gender associations of industries and company names using word vectors. How are these associations quantified? What results emerge from correlating these associations with percentage of female names generated?

8. What statistical tests are conducted to determine if differences in metrics like miss rate, declination rate etc. across male and female groups are significant? What p-values do the authors report?

9. The entrepreneurs dataset contains names from recent years while the models are trained on older data. How does this aspect affect the factuality analysis presented in the paper? Does it make the task inherently harder?

10. The paper introduces the Response Concentration Score. What are some ways in which this metric could be improved or built upon in future work on evaluating fairness of generative models? What are its limitations?
