# [Evaluating LLMs for Gender Disparities in Notable Persons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09148)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being used for information retrieval, but there are concerns about their propensity to produce factually incorrect "hallucinated" responses or decline to answer questions altogether.  
- Little research has examined potential gender biases in LLMs' responses to factual queries. Given known gender disparities in representations of notable persons online, it's important to evaluate if LLMs exhibit similar biases.

Methods:
- Evaluated gender differences in accuracy, hallucination rates, and declination rates of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across 3 datasets of notable persons (entrepreneurs, Nobel prize winners, Oscar winners).   
- Introduced new metric called Response Concentration Score (RCS) to measure how representative the gender distribution of LLM responses is compared to true distribution.
- Analyzed the influence of gender associations in prompts on hallucination rates.

Key Findings:
- GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in accuracy but did not eliminate all gender disparities. Some differences in declination rates and hallucinations remained.
- According to RCS, GPT-4 responses better reflected true gender distribution than GPT-3.5. 
- Gender associations in prompts (e.g. industry for entrepreneurs) impacted hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 but not GPT-4.
- Male names predominately generated as more names returned, indicating homogeneity in hallucinated responses.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluated multiple dimensions of gender fairness in LLC responses - accuracy, hallucinations, declinations
- Introduced new metric, RCS, to measure representativeness of response gender distribution 
- Demonstrated influence of gender associations in prompts on hallucination tendencies
- Highlighted remaining disparities in state-of-the-art LLM
