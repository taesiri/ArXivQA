# [Transferable Interactiveness Knowledge for Human-Object Interaction   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10292)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel two-stage method called Transferable Interactiveness Network (TIN) to improve human-object interaction (HOI) detection. The key idea is to learn general "interactiveness knowledge" that indicates whether a human and object are interacting, and transfer this knowledge across datasets. An Interactiveness Network is used to discriminate between interactive and non-interactive human-object pairs. This allows suppressing non-interactive pairs before HOI classification, significantly reducing false positives. Interactiveness is learned at both the instance-level and part-level in a hierarchical framework, extracting richer interactive cues. A consistency loss enforces agreement between instance and part-level predictions. Since interactiveness knowledge transfers across datasets, the Interactiveness Network can be pre-trained on multiple datasets and fine-tuned for a target dataset, improving performance, especially on rare classes. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET, V-COCO and a new PaStaNet-HOI dataset show state-of-the-art results. The transferred interactiveness knowledge effectively suppresses up to 86% of non-interactive pairs, reducing false positives and demonstrating the power and flexibility of learning interactiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to learn transferable interactiveness knowledge beyond HOI categories, explicitly discriminate interactive/non-interactive pairs, and suppress non-interactive ones before HOI classification to reduce false positives and improve performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method to learn and utilize implicit interactiveness knowledge for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes to explicitly learn "interactiveness knowledge" which indicates whether a human-object pair is interacting or not. This knowledge is more general and transferable across datasets compared to specific HOI categories.

2) A two-stage framework is proposed. First an "interactiveness network" evaluates each human-object pair and suppresses non-interactive pairs. Then the remaining pairs are classified into HOI categories by the HOI classification network. This helps reduce false positives. 

3) The paper proposes a hierarchical paradigm to learn both instance-level and part-level interactiveness, and introduces a consistency loss between them. Part-level interactiveness helps learn deeper interactive patterns.

4) Extensive experiments show the proposed interactiveness knowledge brings significant improvements in HOI detection performance when transferred across datasets. The method also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks.

In summary, the key innovation is exploiting the transferable interactiveness knowledge to advance HOI detection, through a two-stage framework and hierarchical interaction modeling.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection - Detecting interactions between humans and objects in images, a sub-task of visual relationship detection.

- Interactiveness - An attribute indicating whether a human-object pair is interacting or not, more general than specific HOI categories.

- Transferable interactiveness knowledge - The interactiveness attribute allows interactiveness knowledge to be learned across datasets with different HOI categories and transferred between them.

- Hierarchical interactiveness - Learning interactiveness at both the human/object instance level and the human body part level. Enforces consistency between these levels.

- Non-Interaction Suppression (NIS) - Using the learned interactiveness knowledge to suppress non-interacting human-object pairs before HOI classification. Converts a dense HOI graph to a sparse one. 

- Low-grade Instance Suppressive (LIS) - Downweights low-confidence human/object detections based on their detection scores.

- Representation network, Classification network, Interactiveness network - Key components of the proposed Transferable Interactiveness Network (TIN) framework.

Some other key aspects are transfer learning of interactiveness, part interactiveness patterns, ablation studies, and state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET, V-COCO, and PaStaNet-HOI datasets.
