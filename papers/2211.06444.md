# [Probabilistic Debiasing of Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06444)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:

How can we debias scene graph generation models to improve performance on less frequent, "tail" relationships while maintaining performance on more frequent, "head" relationships? 

The key ideas and approach seem to be:

- Scene graph relationships exhibit a long-tailed distribution, where a few relationships like "on" and "wearing" are very frequent, while many others are quite rare.

- Existing models are biased towards predicting these frequent relationships, achieving good performance on them but poor performance on rare ones. 

- The authors propose using Bayesian inference to combine a prior distribution that captures the dependency between relationships and their subject/object with the uncertain outputs from existing biased models. 

- This allows debiasing the predictions to improve performance on rare relationships without overly harming performance on frequent ones.

- They also propose a novel method of augmenting the training data for the prior using sentence embeddings, to account for annotation biases.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that this Bayesian inference approach can debias scene graph generation to improve mean recall across all relationships while balancing performance on frequent vs rare relationships.
