# [Probabilistic Debiasing of Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06444)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:

How can we debias scene graph generation models to improve performance on less frequent, "tail" relationships while maintaining performance on more frequent, "head" relationships? 

The key ideas and approach seem to be:

- Scene graph relationships exhibit a long-tailed distribution, where a few relationships like "on" and "wearing" are very frequent, while many others are quite rare.

- Existing models are biased towards predicting these frequent relationships, achieving good performance on them but poor performance on rare ones. 

- The authors propose using Bayesian inference to combine a prior distribution that captures the dependency between relationships and their subject/object with the uncertain outputs from existing biased models. 

- This allows debiasing the predictions to improve performance on rare relationships without overly harming performance on frequent ones.

- They also propose a novel method of augmenting the training data for the prior using sentence embeddings, to account for annotation biases.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that this Bayesian inference approach can debias scene graph generation to improve mean recall across all relationships while balancing performance on frequent vs rare relationships.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a Bayesian network-based framework to debias scene graph generation models by combining prior knowledge of triplets with uncertain evidence from existing models. 

- Introducing a novel learning scheme to augment the training data for the Bayesian network using embedding similarity of valid and invalid triplets. This helps alleviate the issue of insufficient minority samples.

- Performing inference on the Bayesian network to simultaneously remove bias from the marginal distribution of relationships while preserving the object-conditional dependencies. 

- Achieving improved balance between recall and mean recall metrics compared to prior debiasing techniques, without needing to retrain the original models.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach by debiasing several existing SGG models on Visual Genome and GQA datasets.

In summary, the key novelty is formulating debiasing as a probabilistic inference problem using a Bayesian network, and showing how embedding-based data augmentation can help learn the network parameters efficiently. The inference framework is model-agnostic and improves various biased SGG models.
