# [On a Functional Definition of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is no agreed upon definition of "intelligence" which makes questions like "is this system intelligent?" difficult to answer. 
- Most prior attempts at defining intelligence are linked to natural intelligence (humans/animals) which may not capture artificial intelligence.
- A precise, testable definition of intelligence is needed to guide AI development and public policy discussions.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a functional, black-box definition of intelligence based on inputs and outputs, not implementation details. 
- Distinguish intelligence from related concepts like sensations, autonomy, agency, skill. Show these are orthogonal.
- Define intelligence as a combination of knowledge, reasoning (logical and planning), and learning capabilities.
- Formally define metrics for assessing:
    - Quality of knowledge (accuracy of internal world model compared to real world)
    - Quality and speed of planning/reasoning 
    - Improvement in knowledge, planning and speed from new data/experiences
- Express intelligence as a mathematical function combining these metrics into a single continuous variable.

Contributions:  
- Precise, testable, functional definition of intelligence decoupled from anthropomorphic concepts
- Distinctions between intelligence and related concepts like autonomy, sensations, etc.
- Mathematical formulation expressing intelligence as a continuous variable based on knowledge, reasoning and learning.
- Framework to quantitatively measure intelligence (though some challenges around test design remain).
- Supports development of AI systems and policy discussions by providing clarity on definition of intelligence.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a formal, functional definition of intelligence as a combination of knowledge, reasoning, and learning capabilities that can be quantitatively measured, in order to provide an objective framework to evaluate and develop artificial intelligence systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

Providing a formal, quantifiable, testable definition of intelligence that is purely functional and focuses on externally observable properties (inputs and outputs of a system). Specifically, the paper:

- Distinguishes concepts like sensations, autonomy, agency, skill, and sentience from intelligence.

- Defines intelligence as a combination of the abilities to learn, store knowledge, and reason (logical reasoning and planning). 

- Formally defines each of those abilities.

- Presents a mathematical equation to quantify intelligence based on the quality and learning potential of a system's knowledge, reasoning, and performance.

In summary, the paper attempts to achieve a precise, testable definition of intelligence that can inform the development and evaluation of AI systems, independent of a specific implementation. It also hopes to support discussions on AI ethics, risks, etc. by clarifying terminology.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Intelligence - The main focus of the paper is trying to define intelligence in a precise, testable way.

- Functional definition - The authors argue for a definition of intelligence based purely on external, observable behavior rather than internal mechanisms.

- Black box testing - Related to the functional definition, the authors state intelligence should be evaluated by treating the system as a black box and only observing inputs and outputs.  

- Knowledge, reasoning, learning - The authors break down intelligence into three key capacities - the ability to store knowledge, reason based on that knowledge, and learn to improve reasoning and knowledge.

- Orthogonal concepts - The paper distinguishes intelligence from related concepts like sensations, autonomy, agency, skill and sentience. 

- Formal mathematical definition - The authors provide a mathematical formulation of intelligence based on the accuracy of a system's internal world model, its planning abilities, and its improvement from new data/experience.

- Testability and measurement - There is discussion around the challenges in actually testing and quantifying the proposed formal definition of intelligence.

Does this summary appropriately capture some of the core ideas and terminology covered in the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues for an argumentative methodology to define intelligence. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using an argumentative approach compared to empirical or formal methods? How does the goal of achieving a precise definition justify using arguments over other methodologies?

2. The definition of intelligence proposed relies heavily on the concept of a system's "internal world model". What are the challenges in accurately measuring how well an artificial system's internal world model corresponds to the real world? How can we account for unknowns or biases in the observer's own world model?

3. The paper claims intelligence is made up of the abilities to learn, reason, and store knowledge. Are there any other key components comprising intelligence that are not covered? Why or why not? What evidence supports the sufficiency of just these three components?

4. How exactly would you measure the rate of improvement in a system's world model, planning capabilities, or action selection speed given new data or experiences? What specific metrics could quantify these rates of improvement? 

5. The equation for intelligence contains numerous weight parameters - how should appropriate values for these weights be determined? What analyses could identify the relative importance of each component of intelligence?

6. The paper argues logical reasoning is nothing more than the capability to apply rules of formal logic. Does this underestimate the complexity behind advanced reasoning? What other aspects of reasoning are missing from this perspective?

7. What are the key differences between the concept of intelligence proposed here and the Turing test? What specifically makes the Turing test insufficient for evaluating artificial intelligence?

8. How feasible is it to comprehensively measure all terms that comprise the intelligence equation? What open challenges remain in quantifying each of these contributing factors? 

9. The paper claims tests of intelligence will always be relative to the observer's intelligence. What are the consequences of this perspective? Does it mean true intelligence measurement is fundamentally impossible?

10. What types of empirical evidence could further support or refine the theoretical framework and formalized definition of intelligence proposed in this work? What experiments would you design to validate aspects of the model?
