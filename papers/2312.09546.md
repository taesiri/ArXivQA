# [On a Functional Definition of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is no agreed upon definition of "intelligence" which makes questions like "is this system intelligent?" difficult to answer. 
- Most prior attempts at defining intelligence are linked to natural intelligence (humans/animals) which may not capture artificial intelligence.
- A precise, testable definition of intelligence is needed to guide AI development and public policy discussions.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a functional, black-box definition of intelligence based on inputs and outputs, not implementation details. 
- Distinguish intelligence from related concepts like sensations, autonomy, agency, skill. Show these are orthogonal.
- Define intelligence as a combination of knowledge, reasoning (logical and planning), and learning capabilities.
- Formally define metrics for assessing:
    - Quality of knowledge (accuracy of internal world model compared to real world)
    - Quality and speed of planning/reasoning 
    - Improvement in knowledge, planning and speed from new data/experiences
- Express intelligence as a mathematical function combining these metrics into a single continuous variable.

Contributions:  
- Precise, testable, functional definition of intelligence decoupled from anthropomorphic concepts
- Distinctions between intelligence and related concepts like autonomy, sensations, etc.
- Mathematical formulation expressing intelligence as a continuous variable based on knowledge, reasoning and learning.
- Framework to quantitatively measure intelligence (though some challenges around test design remain).
- Supports development of AI systems and policy discussions by providing clarity on definition of intelligence.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary!
