# [Towards Automatic Learning of Procedures from Web Instructional Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09788)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can the human-consensus structure of a procedure be learned from a large set of long, unconstrained videos (e.g. instructional videos from YouTube) with only visual evidence?

The key points are:

- Learning the procedure structure and steps from videos, without relying on subtitles/captions or other textual input.

- Using only visual information from the videos.

- Learning from unconstrained, 'in the wild' videos like those found on YouTube. 

- Capturing the human consensus on how procedures are structured and segmented.

So in summary, the paper is investigating if AI/computer vision models can learn procedural knowledge purely from observing unlabeled video, in a way that reflects human consensus on the structure of procedures. This is posed as a core research question to be addressed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the new problem of procedure segmentation, which is to segment a long, unconstrained video into a sequence of category-independent procedure segments that capture the human consensus on the procedure structure. 

2. It collects and distributes a large-scale dataset called YouCook2 for studying procedure segmentation in instructional videos. YouCook2 contains 2000 cooking videos totaling 176 hours with temporal boundary annotations and textual descriptions for procedure segments.

3. It proposes an end-to-end neural network model called Procedure Segmentation Networks (ProcNets) for automatically segmenting procedures from videos. ProcNets have three main components:

- Context-aware video encoding with Bi-LSTM
- Procedure segment proposal module
- Sequential prediction module that models dependencies between segments

4. It benchmarks ProcNets and other competitive baselines on the YouCook2 dataset using standard metrics like Jaccard index and mean IoU. The results show ProcNets significantly outperform the baselines in procedure segmentation.

5. It provides ablation studies and analysis showing ProcNets can learn meaningful temporal structure of procedures. The output segments of ProcNets could be used for other downstream tasks like dense video captioning.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and providing a solution to the novel problem of procedure segmentation in long, unconstrained instructional videos. The large-scale dataset, proposed method, experiments and analyses help establish this new problem space.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new problem called procedure segmentation, where the goal is to automatically segment a long, unconstrained instructional video into meaningful steps, and proposes a model called Procedure Segmentation Networks (ProcNets) to tackle this problem using a segment proposal module followed by a sequential prediction module that models dependencies between segments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on procedure segmentation compares to other related research:

- It introduces a new problem of segmenting long, unconstrained instructional videos into procedure segments representing steps to accomplish a task. This is different from prior work on event proposal and action segmentation that focuses on shorter actions/events. 

- The paper collects a large new dataset (YouCook2) of 2000 cooking videos with temporal boundaries and descriptions of procedure segments. This is much larger and contains more detailed annotations than existing instructional video datasets.

- The proposed ProcNets model procedure segmentation without relying on subtitles or knowing the number of steps ahead of time. This removes key assumptions made in prior methods for procedure learning.

- ProcNets uses a segment-level LSTM to model dependencies between proposed segments. This differs from frame-level models like vsLSTM and captures procedure structure better.

- Experiments show ProcNets significantly outperforms baselines like SCNN and vsLSTM on procedure segmentation metrics. The analysis also demonstrates ProcNets' ability to learn procedure structure.

In summary, this paper tackles a new problem setup, collects a large dataset to facilitate research, and proposes a novel recurrent approach for procedure segmentation that advances over prior frame-level and assumption-heavy methods. The problem and model seem well-motivated by limitations of prior research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Dense video captioning: The authors suggest using the output procedure segments from ProcNets as a preprocessing step for dense video captioning, which aims to generate natural language descriptions for events in a video. ProcNets could help identify the meaningful events to caption.

- Weakly supervised segmentation: The authors propose using ProcNets in a weakly supervised setting where only weak alignment between subtitles/audio and video is available for training. ProcNets could then be trained on the aligned annotations to learn segmentation.

- Incorporating local motion features: The authors mention local motion features could further improve ProcNets' performance but they did not explore this. Incorporating optical flow or other motion features is suggested.

- Extending to embodied agents: The authors motivate procedure segmentation as useful for agents (embodied or software) to learn procedures. They suggest extending ProcNets to learn full procedures for agents.

- Annotation extensions: The authors suggest adding further annotations to YouCook2 like object bounding boxes could enable research on fine-grained recognition.

- Long-range dependencies: The authors mention long-range dependencies over many frames are still challenging for current recurrent models. Improving modeling of long-range dependencies is suggested.

In summary, the key future directions are in using ProcNets for downstream video and language tasks, improving modeling with more supervision and annotations, incorporating motion, extending to agents, and better handling long videos.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new problem called procedure segmentation, which is to segment a long, unconstrained instructional video into a sequence of category-independent procedure segments that reflect human consensus on the procedure structure. The authors collect a large-scale cooking video dataset named YouCook2 with 2000 videos and 176 hours in length. The dataset has temporal boundary annotations and imperative descriptions for the procedure segments in each video. To address the procedure segmentation problem, the authors propose Procedure Segmentation Networks (ProcNets) which contain three modules: context-aware video encoding, segment proposal and sequential prediction. ProcNets take frame-wise visual features as input and output procedure segment proposals. It outperforms competitive baselines like LSTM-based video summarization and action proposal methods on standard evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate ProcNets' capability of capturing procedure structure and temporal dependencies across segments. The proposed segments can benefit other video understanding tasks such as dense video captioning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new problem called procedure segmentation, which involves segmenting a long, unconstrained instructional video into semantic steps that reflect the human consensus on how the procedure is structured. The authors collect a large-scale dataset called YouCook2 containing 2000 cooking videos totaling 176 hours with temporal boundary annotations and descriptions for each procedure segment. They propose an end-to-end neural network model called Procedure Segmentation Networks (ProcNets) which contains three main components: 1) context-aware video encoding with bi-directional LSTM on frame features, 2) a segment proposal module to localize segment candidates, and 3) a sequential prediction module using LSTM to model dependencies between segments and predict the final proposals. Experiments show ProcNets outperforming competitive baselines on procedure segmentation metrics. Analysis also demonstrates ProcNets' ability to learn video structure and temporal dependencies between segments.

The key contributions of this work are three-fold. First, it introduces and tackles the novel problem of category-independent procedure segmentation in long, unconstrained instructional videos. Second, it collects and distributes the large-scale YouCook2 dataset containing rich annotations for procedure segmentation. Third, it proposes ProcNets which operates on the segment-level rather than frame-level to model temporal dependencies and structure, outperforming other approaches on this task. Future work includes extensions to dense video captioning and weakly supervised segmentation using alignments with subtitles. Overall this paper makes solid contributions in defining and collecting data for a new task, proposing a model that captures temporal dependencies at the segment-level, and benchmarking procedure segmentation approaches on the new dataset.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel approach called Procedure Segmentation Networks (ProcNets) for segmenting long, unconstrained instructional videos into procedure steps. The key ideas are:

1. Encode the video frames with a Bi-LSTM to get context-aware features. 

2. Propose segment candidates using a temporal convolution network with anchors and offsets, similar to object detection. This module acts like generating an initial rough segmentation.

3. Feed the proposals into an LSTM model to predict the final sequence of segments. The LSTM takes as input the proposal scores, a location embedding, and segment visual features. It models the sequential dependencies between segments.

In summary, ProcNets combines temporal proposal generation with sequential modeling on the proposals to segment videos in a completely unsupervised way, without relying on subtitles or a fixed grammar. Experiments on a large cooking video dataset called YouCook2 demonstrate superior performance over prior video summarization and action proposal methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of automatically learning and segmenting the steps or procedures from long, unconstrained instructional videos such as those found on YouTube. The key questions are:

- Can the human-consensus structure of a procedure be learned from a large set of long, unconstrained videos with only visual evidence? 

- Can an agent segment a video procedure into meaningful steps without relying on subtitles, transcripts or requiring knowledge about the number of steps?

The authors refer to this problem as "procedure segmentation". The goal is to take an input video and segment it into a sequence of steps that captures the high-level procedure or process depicted in the video.

Some key points:

- Existing work relies heavily on subtitles/transcripts or assumes a fixed number of steps per procedure. The authors want to move beyond these limitations.

- They introduce a new large-scale dataset called YouCook2 containing 2000 cooking videos totaling 176 hours with temporal boundaries and descriptions annotated for each step.

- They propose an end-to-end neural model called ProcNets that uses a proposal module to locate candidate segments and then a sequential prediction module to select the final segments based on temporal dependencies.

- Experiments show ProcNets can accurately segment procedures without any text input and outperforms previous methods like LSTM and proposal methods used for action detection.

In summary, the paper focuses on the novel and challenging problem of learning to automatically segment video procedures based solely on visual input.
