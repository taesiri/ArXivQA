# [Addressing cognitive bias in medical language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08113)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Medical errors and misdiagnoses are major issues in healthcare, often stemming from cognitive biases among doctors. However, whether large language models (LLMs) used for medical diagnosis are also susceptible to such biases is unknown. 

- This paper investigates if common cognitive biases reduce the accuracy of LLMs on a medical question answering task, using real clinically relevant biases that have been shown to affect human doctor performance.

Methodology:
- The authors develop a benchmark called BiasMedQA comprising 1273 medical exam questions injected with prompts representing 7 different cognitive biases (self-diagnosis, recency, confirmation, frequency, cultural, status quo, false consensus).

- 6 LLMs are tested - general purpose models GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, Llama 2, Mixtral-8x7B and medical-specialized PMC Llama 13B.

- Accuracy with and without bias prompts is evaluated. 3 bias mitigation strategies are also proposed and tested - bias education, one-shot bias demonstration, few-shot bias demonstration.

Results:
- All models show reduced accuracy from 10-26% on biased vs unbiased data. False consensus bias causes the greatest drop in accuracy.

- GPT-4 displays most resilience to biases. Specialized medical model PMC Llama 13B is disproportionately affected.  

- Bias mitigation gains are modest - model accuracy doesn't recover fully relative to unbiased performance. GPT-4 benefits most from mitigation.

Conclusions:
- Medical LLMs remain susceptible to simple cognitive biases, highlighting need for greater robustness.

- BiasMedQA provides a new benchmark for evaluating bias in medical LLMs.  

- More research needed into bias mitigation strategies and limitations of LLMs for reliable real-world medical use.

Main Contributions:
- First study showing medical LLMs susceptible to cognitive biases that affect human clinicians

- Novel benchmark BiasMedQA to evaluate bias in medical LLMs

- Analysis of multiple bias mitigation strategies on a range of LLMs

- Demonstrates need for further progress to ensure safety of LLMs in high-stakes medical settings


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark to evaluate whether medical language models exhibit similar susceptibility to cognitive biases as human doctors, finding that various biases can significantly reduce diagnostic accuracy in these models, indicating more research is needed to mitigate bias and improve reliability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of BiasMedQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating cognitive biases in large language models applied to medical tasks. Specifically:

- The authors created a dataset called BiasMedQA based on 1,273 questions from the USMLE exam, modified to include common clinically-relevant cognitive biases like confirmation bias, anchoring, etc. 

- They evaluated six major language models (GPT-4, PaLM, LLaMA, etc.) on BiasMedQA to analyze the effect of different cognitive biases on the models' diagnostic accuracy.

- They found that the biases significantly reduced diagnostic accuracy across all models, with an average drop of 24.9% for false consensus bias specifically. This highlights issues around potential biases if these models are deployed in real clinical settings.

- They proposed and evaluated three bias mitigation strategies - bias education, one-shot demonstration, and few-shot demonstration. While these approaches helped, model accuracy still did not recover fully.

In summary, the key contribution is the new BiasMedQA benchmark and analysis illuminating issues of cognitive bias in medical LLMs, providing a foundation for further work on bias mitigation and safety.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called BiasMedQA for evaluating cognitive biases in medical language models. What specific types of cognitive biases does this benchmark aim to evaluate and why were they chosen? 

2. The authors test several mitigation strategies including bias education, one-shot bias demonstration, and few-shot bias demonstration. Can you explain in detail what each mitigation strategy entails and what the key differences are?

3. For the one-shot and few-shot strategies, examples are drawn from the MedQA training set. What is the rationale behind using the training set for this instead of the test set? Would there be any disadvantages to using the test set?

4. The results show that GPT-4 exhibits higher levels of improvement across all mitigation strategies compared to other models. What architectural or training differences might account for GPT-4's superior performance?

5. The false consensus bias resulted in the largest decrease in model performance. Why might this type of bias be especially challenging for language models to overcome? 

6. For certain models like PaLM-2, high non-response rates were observed for the one-shot and few-shot strategies. What underlying reasons could explain this behavior?

7. In the conclusion, the authors note that model accuracy with mitigation does not match the accuracy achieved without bias prompts. What are some potential ways the mitigation strategies could be improved to close this performance gap?

8. The paper demonstrates susceptibility of medical LLMs to simple cognitive biases. How might performance be further impacted by more complex, nuanced biases that can occur in real clinical interactions?

9. What are some ways the proposed benchmark and analysis could be expanded to better characterize additional facets of bias susceptibility beyond just accuracy reductions? 

10. The authors suggest bias mitigation for medical LLMs is still in early stages. What other techniques beyond those explored could hold promise for being robust to a wide range of cognitive biases?
