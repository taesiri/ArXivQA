# [Improving Large Language Models via Fine-grained Reinforcement Learning   with Minimum Editing Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06081)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to train large language models (LLMs) to prevent unexpected/harmful outputs. 
- However, existing RL methods mostly use instance-level rewards, which cannot provide fine-grained supervision for complex reasoning tasks. They cannot focus learning on the key tokens leading to incorrect outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new RL method called RLMEC that uses a generative model to produce token-level rewards.
- The generative reward model is trained on an erroneous solution rewriting task with minimum editing constraint. It learns to locate and correct errors in LLM outputs with minimal edits.
- Based on the generative model, token-level RL objective and imitation regularization are designed to focus learning on key error-causing tokens.

Key Contributions:
- Novel use of a generative reward model trained with minimum editing constraint to provide fine-grained token-level rewards.
- Token-level RL objective focused on learning from key tokens leading to errors.
- Imitation regularization to further stabilize RL training.
- Experiments on mathematical and QA reasoning tasks show RLMEC outperforms competitive baselines on multiple LLMs.
- Analysis shows RLMEC can stabilize training and reduce erroneous outputs.

In summary, the key innovation is using a generative model trained with minimal editing as a structured reward function for token-level RL. This provides focused fine-grained learning signals to enhance reasoning abilities of LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning method called RLMEC that uses a generative reward model trained with minimum editing constraint to provide fine-grained token-level supervision for improving large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing RLMEC, a new reinforcement learning framework that uses a generative reward model to provide fine-grained, token-level rewards for training large language models (LLMs). Key aspects of RLMEC include:

- Training a generative reward model on an erroneous solution rewriting task with minimum editing constraint, using distillation from a teacher LLM. This focuses the model on key tokens leading to errors.

- Using the generative reward model to produce token-level rewards for LLM outputs, enabling more targeted optimization compared to instance-level rewards. 

- Designing a token-level RL objective and imitation-based regularization loss to train the LLM, focusing learning on key erroneous tokens.

The paper shows experimentally that RLMEC outperforms prior RL and fine-tuning methods in improving reasoning ability on question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks. The fine-grained supervision helps the LLM training focus on avoiding and correcting key mistakes.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new reinforcement learning framework called RLMEC. Can you explain in detail how the generative reward model is trained and what objective it optimizes? What is the key benefit of using a generative model compared to a discriminative model?

2. The erroneous solution rewriting task incorporates a minimum editing constraint. Why is this constraint important? How does it help the generative reward model provide more focused token-level rewards? 

3. Explain the two subtasks involved in the erroneous solution rewriting task - error locating and solution rewriting. What is the purpose of each subtask and how do they work together?  

4. In the token-level rewards generation, reward thresholds alpha and beta are used. What is the purpose of these thresholds? How do they enable focusing only on error tokens?

5. The token-level RL objective is different from the standard PPO objective. Can you clearly explain this new objective and why it enables fine-grained token-level learning?  

6. An imitation-based regularization is also added along with the RL objective. Why is this needed and how exactly does it work? What specifically does the Levenshtein distance algorithm do here?

7. Analyze the key differences between the supervision signals provided by RLMEC versus prior methods like PPO A2C. Use examples to illustrate the differences.  

8. How does the scaling of the generative reward model impact overall performance? What were the key findings from the scaling analysis experiments?

9. What are some ways the method can be simplified to reduce resource requirements? Explain each with their tradeoffs.  

10. What kinds of complex reasoning tasks can benefit the most from RLMEC? Why does it work well for mathematical and question answering tasks demonstrated in the paper?
