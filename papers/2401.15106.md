# [Decision Theoretic Foundations for Experiments Evaluating Human   Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15106)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a decision problem and what is required for an experiment to conclude that human decisions are flawed. This makes it difficult to compare studies on human decision-making and identify biased behavior. 

- Many studies claim to identify biases in human decisions from information displays, but do not provide participants with enough information to determine the optimal, normative decision. This precludes establishing human decisions as flawed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper synthesizes a definition of a decision problem from statistical decision theory and information economics. This includes: uncertain state, state space, data-generating model, signaling policy, action space, and scoring rule.  

- The paper argues experiments must provide participants information a rational agent needs to identify the normative decision in order to attribute loss to forms of bias. 

- Using this framework, only 6 out of 35 studies (17%) that claimed to identify biased behavior actually presented participants with sufficient information.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes minimum components to define a decision problem that allows identifying an optimal decision and forms of bias

- Shows that most experiments do not communicate decision problems sufficiently for participants to identify optimal decisions

- Defines four sources of performance loss: prior, receiver, updating, and optimization loss

- Makes recommendations for practice, including conveying problem components clearly, providing information to calculate posteriors, and comparing to best attainable performance

The paper motivates defining rigorous decision problems to improve the interpretability of experiments on human decision-making, especially regarding conclusions about performance losses attributable to bias.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper synthesizes a definition of a decision problem from statistical decision theory and information economics, argues that experiments aiming to evaluate human decision-making must provide participants with sufficient information to identify the normative decision, finds that few existing studies meet this criteria, and provides recommendations to improve experimental design and interpretation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Establishing a minimum set of components (i.e. statespace, data-generating model, signaling policy, action space, scoring rule) for defining a decision problem to allow identification of an optimal decision and sources of bias in human decisions. 

2) Analyzing a sample of recent evaluative studies on AI-assisted decisions, finding that only 17% of studies that draw conclusions about flawed human decisions actually provide participants with sufficient information to characterize their behavior as deviating from good decision-making.

3) Motivating the value of studying well-defined decision problems by describing the characterization of performance losses they enable, in contrast to poorly communicated decision problems where normative interpretation is precluded. 

4) Providing recommendations for empirical practice in human decision-making research, including clearly conveying the necessary components of a decision problem, motivating scoring rules, comparing to best attainable performance, and attempting to estimate specific sources of loss.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Decision problem: A choice between alternatives with uncertainty about outcomes, defined in terms of statespace, action space, data-generating model, signaling policy, and scoring rule.

- Normative decision theory: The use of statistical decision theory and expected utility theory to define optimal behavior for a decision problem. Allows identification of sources of suboptimal performance (loss).  

- Sources of loss: Prior loss, receiver loss, updating loss, optimization loss. Ways that human decisions can deviate from optimal.

- Well-defined decision problem: A decision problem that provides participants sufficient information to identify the optimal decision, enabling conclusions about biased or flawed decisions. 

- Recommendations: Clearly convey components of decision problem to participants; provide sufficient information about data generating model; motivate scoring rules; compare to best attainable performance; elicit measures of specific sources of loss.

The key focus is on establishing necessary components to define decision problems such that conclusions can validly be made about the quality of human decisions, especially with regards to "bias." The paper reviews studies making claims about human bias and evaluates if a well-defined decision problem was presented.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues for clearly defining components of a decision problem like state space, action space, scoring rule, etc. However, in some real-world settings, these components may not be clearly defined. How can the framework be adapted for such ambiguous decision problems? 

2. The paper recommends comparing observed human performance to the best attainable performance under the scoring rule. However, calculating this benchmark requires making assumptions about a rational Bayesian agent. How sensitive are the results to the assumptions made about this rational benchmark?

3. The paper defines four potential sources of loss in human decision-making experiments. What kinds of additional measures could an experiment collect in order to estimate or separate out these distinct sources of loss? 

4. The paper focuses on controlled experiments aimed at normative analysis. How well would this framework apply to more naturalistic decision-making scenarios where the goal is to descriptively study real-world behavior?

5. The proper scoring rule distinction seems most relevant for belief elicitation tasks where the action space is the space of probability distributions. How important is this distinction when the action space only consists of two or a few discrete choices?  

6. The paper argues that unclear communication of the decision problem leads to uninterpretable heterogeneity in human responses. However, some argue that imposing too narrow a decision framework inherently limits behavioral variance in a problematic way. How can these tensions be balanced?

7. Most of the examples in the paper focus on prediction-type tasks like forecasting or AI-assisted decisions. How well does the framework apply to other types of decision problems, like preferential choice, ranking, etc.?

8. The paper analyzes a sample of recent AI-assisted decision-making studies. To what extent could similar issues around problem definition affect other bodies of research on human judgment and decision-making?  

9. The paper focuses mainly on monetary incentives. How central are well-aligned incentives to enabling normative analysis, compared to clearly communicating other components like state/action spaces, data generating process, etc.?

10. The paper argues that simulating an ideal Bayesian agent can help vet experimental designs. What are some practical challenges in implementing such rational agent simulations? Do the benefits justify the additional effort?
