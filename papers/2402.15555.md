# [Deep Networks Always Grok and Here is Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15555)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Grokking is a phenomenon where deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit delayed generalization, i.e. they generalize to test data long after achieving near-perfect training accuracy. Prior works have reported grokking in limited settings like transformers on algorithmic tasks. 

Key Contributions
- The authors demonstrate that grokking is widespread and occurs in convolutional and ResNet models on CIFAR and Imagenette datasets. They introduce a new concept called "delayed robustness" where models grok adversarial examples long after interpolating or generalizing.

- They develop an analytical explanation for delayed generalization and robustness based on quantifying the "local complexity" of a DNN's input-output mapping. Local complexity measures the density of linear regions tiling the input space.

- They provide first evidence of a phase transition in training where linear regions migrate from training data (smoothing mapping there) towards decision boundaries (complexifying mapping there). Grokking occurs after this transition as a robust partition of input space emerges.

Proposed Solution
- The authors use the spline perspective of DNNs to define local complexity - a novel progress measure for training. Local complexity undergoes a double descent during training. 

- First descent: Initialization effect.  
- Ascent: Accumulation of linear regions around data. 
- Second descent: Region migration away from data towards decision boundaries. This causes eventual grokking.

- Several ablation studies connect the training phases to DNN hyperparameters like depth, width and connect grokking to memorization. Batch norm is shown to inhibit grokking.

To summarize, the paper provides strong evidence that grokking is a general phenomenon deeply tied to the geometry of DNN functions, quantifiable via local complexity. Region migration causes the emergence of a robust partition explaining delayed generalization and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper demonstrates that delayed generalization (grokking) emerges ubiquitously during deep network training due to a phase transition in the geometry of the input space partitioning, whereby non-linearities first accumulate then migrate away from data points towards the decision boundary, enabling robust classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions related to the "grokking" phenomenon in deep learning:

1) It introduces the concept of "delayed robustness", a new form of grokking where neural networks start to generalize to adversarial examples long after achieving good performance on the original test set. This shows that grokking is not just limited to the original test data.

2) It proposes a new progress measure called "local complexity" to characterize the nonlinearity of a neural network's mapping in local regions of the input space. The dynamics of local complexity during training, with an initial descent, then ascent, then second descent, are shown to correlate with eventual generalization/robustness through the emergence of a "robust partition".

3) Through visualizations and experiments, the paper provides evidence that the second descent in local complexity corresponds to a "region migration" phenomenon where nonlinearities move away from the training data towards the decision boundary. This migration leads to smoother mappings near the data, enabling eventual generalization and robustness.

4) The paper connects grokking and region migration to various architectural choices and training hyperparameters, showing how factors like depth, width, weight decay and batch normalization impact if/when grokking occurs.

In summary, the key insight is that grokking stems from the natural training dynamics of neural networks as they reorganize their nonlinearities to carve out a robust partition in input space. The local complexity measure and region migration concept provide new tools to understand and control this phenomenon.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Grokking - The phenomenon of delayed generalization in deep neural networks, where test accuracy improves long after the model has achieved near perfect training accuracy. This paper studies both delayed generalization as well as "delayed robustness" to adversarial examples.

- Local complexity - A new progress measure proposed in the paper to quantify the density of non-linearities or "linear regions" in the input space mapping learned by a deep network. The dynamics of local complexity are linked to grokking.

- Region migration - The observed phenomenon of linear regions in a deep network migrating away from training data and towards the decision boundary later in training. This emerges along with the robust partition of the input space and is tied to grokking. 

- Robust partition - The emergence of wider linear regions around training data and increased density of regions near the decision boundary. This partition geometry confers robustness and its formation enables grokking.

- Affine spline functions - The view of deep networks as spline operators composed of piecewise affine mappings. This facilitates analysis of local complexity and region migration.

- Batch normalization - Shown both theoretically and empirically to inhibit grokking by optimizing partition boundaries to be close to training data.

So in summary, the key terms cover the grokking phenomenon, the proposed complexity measure, the analysis via spline theory, the training dynamics and geometry, and role of batch normalization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "delayed robustness" as a new form of grokking in neural networks. How is delayed robustness characterized and how does it differ from delayed generalization? What are the key observations that led the authors to identify this phenomenon?

2. The paper proposes local complexity (LC) as a new progress measure for tracking the training dynamics of neural networks. What is the intuition behind using LC to explain grokking? How is LC computed and what are the assumptions behind the approximation method?

3. The authors identify three distinct phases in the LC dynamics during training - first descent, ascent, and second descent (region migration). What happens in each of these phases? What causes the transitions between phases? 

4. Region migration is identified as a key phenomenon that precedes grokking. What is region migration and what does it entail in terms of the evolution of the neural network function during training? How does region migration lead to the emergence of a "robust partition"?

5. How does the proposed local complexity measure relate to the notion of "circuits" used in mechanistic interpretability frameworks? What parallels can be drawn between region migration and circuit formation/refinement during training?

6. What is the effect of various architectural choices (depth, width) and regularization techniques (weight decay, batch normalization) on the training dynamics captured by the local complexity measure? How do these choices affect region migration?

7. The paper demonstrates LC dynamics and delayed robustness across a diverse range of networks and datasets. To what extent do you think the conclusions generalize beyond the experiments shown? What other network architectures/tasks should be studied?  

8. One limitation noted is the lack of theoretical justification for the distinct phases observed in the LC dynamics. What analyses could provide insight into the transitions between accumulation and repulsion of nonlinearities? 

9. How can the proposed complexity measure be exploited in practical ways - for example, to determine optimal stopping time, evaluate model progress, or detect overfitting?

10. The notion of a "robust partition" in the input space is tied to adversarial robustness. Could the evolution of the partition geometry also explain tradeoffs between robustness, generalizability, and out-of-distribution detection capabilities?
