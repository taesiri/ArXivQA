# [Sparse Global Matching for Video Frame Interpolation with Large Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Video frame interpolation (VFI) aims to generate intermediate frames between given input frames. It has many applications but handling large motions between frames is a key challenge.  
- Existing VFI methods are limited by their local receptive field and cannot effectively capture large motions, especially for fast moving small objects.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a sparse global matching framework to address the large motion challenge in VFI.
- It first uses a CNN-Transformer network to estimate initial intermediate flows at a high resolution to capture local details. 
- Then a sparse global matching branch is introduced to locate flaws in the initial flows using "difference maps". It performs matching at sparse target points globally between input frames to get flow compensation.
- The initial flows and sparse flow compensation are merged adaptively to get the final accurate intermediate flows.

Main Contributions:
- A sparse global matching algorithm specifically designed for large motions in VFI. Establishes sparse global correspondences to compensate initial flow estimations.
- A two-step strategy of first estimating initial flows for local details and then using global matching to target and correct flaws in sparse regions.
- State-of-the-art performance on the most challenging benchmarks for VFI with large motions. Correcting just 1/8 points leads to 0.48dB gain.

In summary, the paper effectively addresses the large motion challenge in VFI via a sparse global matching approach. By locating flaws in initial flows and correcting them through global matching, both local details and large motions can be effectively handled.
