# [Towards Controlled Table-to-Text Generation with Scientific Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating fluent and logical descriptions from scientific tabular data that adhere to user preferences and domain knowledge is challenging. This requires scientific reasoning capabilities that are lacking in current NLG systems.  

- Existing table-to-text datasets focus either on content selection or surface realization. None combine controlled generation constraints with complex scientific reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new task of controlled table-to-text generation with scientific reasoning. This aims to generate descriptions that are consistent with domain knowledge and align with user preferences highlighted in the table.

- They create a new dataset called CTRLSciTab with 8,967 scientific table-description pairs. It has highlighted cells indicating user preferences and a domain knowledge base. 

- They propose a retriever-generator framework called CTRLSciTabNet that selects relevant knowledge sentences and generates descriptions conditioned on tabular data and highlights.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of a new rigorous table-to-text task requiring both content selection control and scientific reasoning.

- CTRLSciTab dataset with highlighted preferences and domain knowledge to facilitate research into this task.

- Proposed CTRLSciTabNet model that combines retrieving domain knowledge with conditional text generation.

- Extensive experiments revealing poor performance of even large pre-trained models, indicating CTRLSciTab's value for advancing scientific NLP.

In summary, this paper identifies challenges in existing table-to-text research, especially for scientific domains. It contributes a new dataset and model for controlled generation grounded in scientific knowledge and reasoning. The benchmark highlights difficulties state-of-the-art models still face in producing accurate, customized scientific content.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new task and dataset for generating analytical descriptions from scientific tabular data that conform to domain knowledge and user preferences, revealing challenges for current methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper content, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) Proposing a new challenging task of controlled table-to-text generation with scientific reasoning. This task aims to generate analytical descriptions from scientific tabular data that are consistent with domain-specific knowledge and align with user preferences. 

2) Constructing a new dataset called CTRLSciTab to facilitate research on this task. CTRLSciTab contains 8,967 scientific table-description pairs extracted from research papers, along with highlighted cells representing user preferences and a knowledge base with domain-specific sentences.

3) Evaluating popular pre-trained language models on CTRLSciTab and showing their deficiencies, revealing that generating accurate content with scientific reasoning is still an open challenge. 

4) Proposing a novel retriever-generator model called CTRLSciTabNet that incorporates a retriever for selecting relevant knowledge sentences and a generator for producing the final descriptions. This model outperforms baseline methods on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in defining a new challenging table-to-text generation task, constructing a valuable benchmark dataset, exposing issues with current methods, and providing a better-performing model as a strong baseline.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a retriever-generator framework called CTRLSciTabNet. What is the motivation behind using a retriever module before the generator module? What challenges does this help address?

2. The retriever module in CTRLSciTabNet uses an unsupervised sentence embedding technique. How is this embedding technique different from traditional sentence embedding techniques? What is the training objective of this retriever module? 

3. The generator module in CTRLSciTabNet is based on BART and T5 models. Why are encoder-decoder type models suitable for the generator task compared to autoregressive models like GPT?

4. The paper argues that existing automatic evaluation metrics are not sufficient for this task. What are some limitations of metrics like BLEU, METEOR etc. for a complex task like controlled generation with scientific reasoning?

5. What are the 4 criteria used for human evaluation in the paper? Why is human evaluation necessary and what key insights do the human evaluation results provide?

6. How does incorporating domain-specific background knowledge impact the performance, both in terms of automatic and human metrics? What hypotheses can you draw from these results?

7. What inferences can you derive from the relatively low faithfulness score even for the best CTRLSciTabNet model in human evaluation? How can this issue be addressed?  

8. One finding is that large pre-trained models like GPT-3.5 still struggle with scientific reasoning tasks requiring domain expertise. What could be the reasons for this?

9. The case study reveals that models without domain knowledge tend to hallucinate incorrect facts. Why does external knowledge help mitigate this issue? What scope still remains for improvement?

10. The paper analyzes certain limitations of the CTRLSciTab dataset itself. What are some ways the dataset could be improved to better facilitate research in controlled generation with reasoning?
