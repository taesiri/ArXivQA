# [Standard Gaussian Process is All You Need for High-Dimensional Bayesian   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02746)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a widespread belief that standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) with Gaussian Processes (GP) fails for high-dimensional (HD) problems (>20 dims). This belief stems from the intuition that GPs struggle to model HD functions and cannot provide an expressive prior.
- Many HD BO methods have been proposed incorporating strong structural assumptions into the surrogate model to avoid directly handling HD inputs, such as additive decomposition, low-dimensional embedding and sparse-inducing priors.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper systematically investigates standard BO with GP regression on 6 synthetic (up to 300 dims) and 6 real-world (30-388 dims) HD optimization benchmarks.

Main Contributions:  
- Standard BO with GP-ARD consistently achieves the best or close to best optimization performance across all tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art HD BO methods.
- Standard GP also excels at HD function regression itself across 12 benchmark datasets, matching or outperforming methods with structural assumptions.  
- The optimization performance of standard BO is possible with maximum likelihood estimation, without expensive MCMC sampling required by more complex models.

Key Conclusions:
- Contrary to common belief, standard GPs are capable of modeling HD functions and enabling effective HD optimization in BO. Imposing unnecessary structural assumptions can be detrimental.
- Standard BO is highly robust in accommodating various structures within the targets, whereas other HD BO methods are sensitive to structural mismatches.  
- The paper advocates re-evaluating and systematically studying the potential of standard BO for addressing HD optimization problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically investigates standard Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes and finds it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods designed for high-dimensional optimization across a variety of benchmarks, challenging the common belief that standard BO fails in high dimensions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing strong empirical evidence to challenge the prevailing belief that standard Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian processes (GPs) performs poorly in high-dimensional optimization problems. Through comprehensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks, the authors demonstrate that standard BO with GP regression consistently achieves the best or close to the best optimization performance, outperforming many existing high-dimensional BO methods designed specifically for such settings. The paper advocates reevaluating and further exploring the potential of standard BO with GPs for tackling high-dimensional optimization problems. Key findings include:

- Standard BO with GPs, especially with ARD kernels, delivers robust and superior optimization performance across tasks with up to 388 dimensions, despite common belief about its ineffectiveness beyond 20 dimensions.

- Standard GPs serve as highly capable surrogates for learning high-dimensional functions, with predictive performance rivaling or exceeding complex models with built-in structural assumptions. 

- With standard GPs, good optimization outcomes can be achieved via maximum likelihood estimation without expensive MCMC sampling required by more complex models.

In summary, this paper provides strong support, through systematic experiments, that standard BO with GPs is much more effective for high-dimensional optimization than previously thought, and calls for renewed investigation of its potential.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that standard Gaussian processes can effectively model high-dimensional functions and enable effective high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. However, most existing works have claimed the opposite. What key factors could explain this conflicting finding? 

2. The paper shows superior performance of standard GP over methods with additive/decompositional assumptions. But how robust is the standard GP when the function does have such decompositional structures? Does wrongly assuming decomposition hurt optimization?

3. For high-dimensional modeling, deep Gaussian processes have shown promise recently. How does standard GP compare with the latest deep GP models? What are the tradeoffs?

4. The paper uses GPyTorch and BOTorch for standard GP. How crucial are these software packages for the good performance observed? How much performance difference is there with other GP software packages? 

5. The benchmark tasks focus on optimizing up to 388 variables. How well could standard GP work when optimizing an even higher number of variables, say 2000+? What are the challenges?

6. For training, the paper uses maximum likelihood estimation. What are the sensitivity and robustness of this versus full Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling? 

7. The paper shows the prediction accuracy of standard GP surpasses methods with dimensionality reduction. But what about uncertainty calibration? Does standard GP over/under-estimate uncertainties in high dimensions?

8. How necessary is using automatic relevance determination (ARD) kernels for high-dimensional modeling? What if simpler kernels like RBF are used instead?

9. The paper focuses on optimization performance. How well does standard GP enable one-shot or few-shot optimization in high dimensions?

10. The benchmarks used fully observable blackbox functions. How would partial observability (bandits) and noise affect the viability of standard GP for high-dimensional optimization?
