# [Fast Benchmarking of Asynchronous Multi-Fidelity Optimization on   Zero-Cost Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01888)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of deep learning is important but computationally expensive. Zero-cost benchmarks can reduce cost by predicting performance without actual training, but fall short in parallel/asynchronous settings where workers must wait to preserve order. This wastes time and energy.

Proposed Solution:
The authors introduce an easy-to-use Python package that efficiently facilitates parallel HPO using zero-cost benchmarks. It calculates the exact return order based on file system information, eliminating long wait times. It supports diverse HPO libraries and provides both multi-core parallel simulation and single-core simulation.

Main Contributions:
- Algorithm to return asynchronous parallel HPO evaluations in correct order without waiting for actual runtimes, using file system synchronization. Reduces wasted time and energy.
- Python package implementing the algorithm that works with various HPO libraries and benchmarks. Handles edge cases correctly.
- Empirical verification of correctness on test cases and actual runtime reduction demonstration.
- Experiments with 6 popular HPO libraries showing applicability, over 1000x speedup compared to naïve simulation, and importance of evaluating parallel performance.

The package enables fast experimentation and research into asynchronous parallel HPO methods. It significantly reduces computational resource usage and CO2 emissions compared to naïve simulation. The authors demonstrate the impact of parallelism on optimizer performance rankings, highlighting the need for proper parallel evaluation.
