# [Learning Unknown Intervention Targets in Structural Causal Models from   Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06091)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points of the paper:

This paper studies the problem of locating intervention targets in structural causal models (SCMs) given heterogeneous data collected from multiple environments. The intervention targets are variables whose exogenous noises have changed across the environments. The paper proposes a two-phase algorithm called Locating Intervention Target (LIT). In the first phase, the algorithm recovers the exogenous noises of the intervention targets using a contrastive learning approach. The second phase matches these recovered noises with their corresponding endogenous variables to identify the intervention targets. 

Under the causal sufficiency assumption, LIT algorithm uniquely identifies the intervention targets using only a quadratic number of conditional independence tests. When there are latent confounders in the system, LIT returns a superset of the true intervention targets which improves upon existing methods. In particular, LIT allows the latent confounders to be among the targets and provides a finer-grained graphical characterization of the recovered target set compared to prior work.

The theoretical results are also validated through experiments on synthetic data. LIT outperforms existing methods designed for linear models or methods that disallow latent confounders or target interventions on them. The contrastive learning approach requires significantly fewer tests compared to methods based on distribution comparisons across environments. Overall, LIT advances the state of the art in locating unknown intervention targets under heterogeneous data settings with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.
