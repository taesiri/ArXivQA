# [Invertible Fourier Neural Operators for Tackling Both Forward and   Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown great success in operator learning for solving forward problems like predicting solutions of PDEs. However, they have limited capability in solving inverse problems like inferring unknown parameters or initial conditions from observed solutions.  
- Inverse problems are ubiquitous in scientific applications but more challenging due to issues like ill-posedness, limited and noisy data.
- Existing methods designed for inverse problems have limitations like large model size or high computational cost.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Invertible Fourier Neural Operators (iFNO) to tackle both forward and inverse problems while overcoming the limitations of previous methods.

- It uses a series of invertible Fourier blocks in the latent space to enable bijective mapping between inputs and outputs for expressive functional transformation.

- A variational autoencoder (VAE) is integrated to capture intrinsic structures of the input space. This handles challenges like ill-posedness and data shortage. The VAE also enables posterior inference for uncertainty quantification.

- A 3-step training procedure involving pretraining of components and fine-tuning is used for efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- First model capable of solving both forward and inverse problems via operator learning with a shared compact architecture.

- Invertible architecture with Fourier blocks enables accurate bi-directional prediction while reducing model size.

- Integration of VAE handles inherent challenges of inverse problems and provides uncertainty estimates.

- Substantially outperforms previous operator learning methods designed for either forward or inverse problems across multiple PDE benchmarks.  

- Ablation studies validate the contribution of both invertible blocks and VAE to achieving the high performance.

In summary, the paper makes significant advances in making operator learning suitable for coupled forward and inverse problems, which has broad applicability across scientific domains. The proposed iFNO model outperforms previous methods by effectively tackling specific challenges of inverse problems.
