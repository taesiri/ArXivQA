# [Wavelet-Like Transform-Based Technology in Response to the Call for   Proposals on Neural Network-Based Image Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Traditional image compression standards like JPEG and JPEG2000 lack the ability to effectively capture complex spatial correlations between pixels. Recently, deep learning based image compression methods have shown great potential and even surpassed traditional standards like H.266/VVC. To promote the application of deep learning based methods, standardization groups like IEEE have started projects to develop end-to-end learning based image coding standards. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework called iWaveV3 in response to the IEEE 1857.11 Call for Proposals (CfP) for such a standard.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed iWaveV3 framework contains four main modules - wavelet-like transform, quantization, entropy coding and post-processing. It supports three coding configurations - objective-oriented lossy coding, perceptual-oriented lossy coding and near-lossless coding. The transform module uses additive wavelet-like transform, affine wavelet-like transform or CDF 5/3 wavelet which can be selected based on coding mode. Advanced quantization, entropy coding schemes and optimization strategies are proposed. A perceptual-friendly quality metric is used to improve visual quality. Online optimization is also introduced to adapt the framework for individual images.

Main Contributions:
- A flexible end-to-end framework supporting lossless, lossy and near-lossless image compression with competitive performance.
- Advanced components like affine wavelet-like transform, context-based entropy coder, post-processing modules.   
- Perceptual-friendly quality metric for visually superior reconstructed images.
- Online optimization strategy to adapt model for individual images.
- State-of-the-art lossy compression performance. The method is adopted as a candidate scheme for IEEE 1857.11 standard development.

In summary, the paper proposes a highly flexible and efficient end-to-end learned image compression framework with advanced components and optimization strategies. Both objective and subjective results show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art learning based and traditional image codecs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an end-to-end wavelet-like transform-based image coding framework called iWaveV3 that achieves state-of-the-art performance for both lossy and lossless image compression.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel end-to-end wavelet-like transform-based image coding framework called iWaveV3. The main contributions of the paper are:

1) It introduces several new technologies into the previous iWave++ framework, including affine wavelet-like transform, advanced training and quantization strategies, perceptual metric and quality, and online optimization. These help to significantly improve compression performance and reconstruction quality.

2) The framework supports three coding configurations - objective-oriented lossy coding, perceptual-oriented lossy coding, and lossless coding. It achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for objective quality lossy coding. For perceptual quality, it is very competitive with other state-of-the-art methods. 

3) Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques. iWaveV3 outperforms traditional and learning-based image codecs on both objective and perceptual quality metrics. As a result, it was adopted as a candidate scheme for the IEEE 1857.11 standard for neural network-based image coding.

In summary, the main contribution is a high performance image coding framework iWaveV3 that introduces several novel components and supports multiple coding configurations, demonstrating superior objective and perceptual rate-distortion performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Wavelet-like transform: The paper proposes using additive and affine wavelet-like transforms as the core transform in the image compression framework. These are learned, nonlinear versions of traditional wavelet transforms.

- End-to-end optimization: The overall image compression framework, including transforms, quantization, entropy coding etc. is trained in an end-to-end manner using loss functions related to rate and distortion. 

- Lossy and lossless compression: The framework supports both lossy image compression by using quantization as well as lossless compression by avoiding quantization.

- Perceptual quality: In addition to rate-distortion performance, the paper also focuses on improving perceptual quality of reconstructed images using features losses and adversarial training.

- Online optimization: An online optimization strategy is proposed to update the input image using the gradient of the loss function to further improve compression performance.

- Variable bitrate: The framework can achieve variable bitrates from a single trained model by adjusting the quantization step size.

- IEEE 1857.11 Call for Proposals: The paper introduces the framework in response to the IEEE call for proposals for a new neural network-based image coding standard. The framework is adopted as a candidate scheme.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes using an affine wavelet-like transform instead of just an additive wavelet-like transform. What is the difference between these two transforms and why does the added flexibility of the affine transform improve performance?

2) The paper utilizes a three-step training approach for objective-oriented lossy coding. Can you explain the rationale behind training the context model and dequantization modules first? Why not train the whole framework end-to-end from the start?  

3) Soft-to-hard and soft-then-hard quantization techniques are used during training. How do these techniques help address the mismatch between training and inference? What are the tradeoffs of using each?

4) The proposed framework supports variable bitrate coding through adjustments of the QStep. How is the model trained to enable good rate-distortion performance across a range of QStep values? What problems arise if variable bitrate is not considered during training?

5) What is the motivation behind using a perceptual quality metric in addition to PSNR? Why can optimizing for PSNR alone result in suboptimal perceptual quality?  

6) Explain the differences in training strategies used for objective-oriented lossy coding, perceptual-oriented lossy coding, and lossless coding. What unique considerations exist for each configuration?

7) What is the purpose of the post-processing module? Why is dequantization applied before perceptual post-processing in the perceptual coding configuration?

8) Online optimization is utilized to further improve compression performance. How does online optimization complement offline training? What specific online optimization strategy is used?

9) Analyze the results of the ablation studies. Which components contribute most significantly to improvements in rate-distortion performance? Why?

10) The proposed method does not perform as well in terms of perceptual quality compared to other state-of-the-art learning-based codecs. What are some possible reasons for this and how might perceptual performance be further improved?
