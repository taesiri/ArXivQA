# [Wavelet-Like Transform-Based Technology in Response to the Call for   Proposals on Neural Network-Based Image Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Traditional image compression standards like JPEG and JPEG2000 lack the ability to effectively capture complex spatial correlations between pixels. Recently, deep learning based image compression methods have shown great potential and even surpassed traditional standards like H.266/VVC. To promote the application of deep learning based methods, standardization groups like IEEE have started projects to develop end-to-end learning based image coding standards. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework called iWaveV3 in response to the IEEE 1857.11 Call for Proposals (CfP) for such a standard.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed iWaveV3 framework contains four main modules - wavelet-like transform, quantization, entropy coding and post-processing. It supports three coding configurations - objective-oriented lossy coding, perceptual-oriented lossy coding and near-lossless coding. The transform module uses additive wavelet-like transform, affine wavelet-like transform or CDF 5/3 wavelet which can be selected based on coding mode. Advanced quantization, entropy coding schemes and optimization strategies are proposed. A perceptual-friendly quality metric is used to improve visual quality. Online optimization is also introduced to adapt the framework for individual images.

Main Contributions:
- A flexible end-to-end framework supporting lossless, lossy and near-lossless image compression with competitive performance.
- Advanced components like affine wavelet-like transform, context-based entropy coder, post-processing modules.   
- Perceptual-friendly quality metric for visually superior reconstructed images.
- Online optimization strategy to adapt model for individual images.
- State-of-the-art lossy compression performance. The method is adopted as a candidate scheme for IEEE 1857.11 standard development.

In summary, the paper proposes a highly flexible and efficient end-to-end learned image compression framework with advanced components and optimization strategies. Both objective and subjective results show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art learning based and traditional image codecs.
