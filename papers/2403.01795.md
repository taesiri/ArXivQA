# [RankED: Addressing Imbalance and Uncertainty in Edge Detection Using   Ranking-based Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01795)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Edge detection suffers from two key issues - (1) heavy class imbalance between positive (edge) and negative (non-edge) pixels, and (2) uncertainty in ground-truth annotations due to disagreement between different human annotators. Existing methods address the imbalance issue using class-balanced losses or dice loss. The uncertainty issue has received little attention, with only one recent work (UAED) modeling label uncertainty.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes RankED, a unified ranking-based approach to address both the imbalance and uncertainty issues in edge detection. The key ideas are:

(1) Ranking loss to address imbalance: A differentiable loss based on Average Precision ranking is used to supervise the model to rank edge pixel scores higher than non-edge pixels. This allows overcoming the imbalance issue.

(2) Sorting loss to address uncertainty: The edge pixels are sorted based on a computed uncertainty score which captures inter-annotator disagreements. The sorting loss then supervises the model to rank low-uncertainty edges higher than high-uncertainty ones.  

Together, the ranking and sorting losses provide a unified approach to address class imbalance and label uncertainty.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes RankED - the first ranking-based edge detection method to address imbalance and uncertainty 
- Introduces two novel losses - ranking loss to handle imbalance and sorting loss to handle uncertainty
- Comprehensive experiments showing RankED outperforms previous state-of-the-art consistently across NYUDv2, BSDS and Multi-Cue datasets
- Proposes uncertainty-aware evaluation to analyze model performance wrt edge certainty levels
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on three datasets while keeping a simple and elegant approach

Overall, the paper makes significant contributions regarding using ranking-based losses to address key data issues in edge detection. The proposed RankED method sets a new state-of-the-art while keeping the approach simple yet effective.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified ranking-based approach called RankED that addresses both the imbalance between positive and negative classes and the uncertainty in edge detection annotations by ranking positive edge pixels over negative pixels and sorting positive pixels by their label certainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes RankED, a new ranking-based loss function for edge detection that addresses both the imbalance between positive and negative classes and the uncertainty in ground truth labels arising from multiple annotations. 

2. RankED contains two novel components - a ranking loss to rank positive edge pixels above negative pixels, and a sorting loss to sort positive pixels by their label certainties.

3. Experiments on NYUD-v2, BSDS500 and Multi-cue datasets show RankED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average precision.

4. The paper provides the first uncertainty-aware evaluation for edge detection, analyzing model performance on edges with different label certainties.

5. The authors develop vectorized implementations of the ranking and sorting losses that significantly speed up training compared to standard iterative implementations.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of RankED, a unified ranking-based approach to address both class imbalance and label uncertainty in edge detection. The consistently superior performance over prior art validates the effectiveness of this approach.

The paper proposes a new method called "RankED" to address the problems of class imbalance and label uncertainty in edge detection using ranking-based losses. The two main components are: (1) ranking positive edge pixels above negative non-edge pixels using an AP loss, and (2) sorting positive pixels by their label uncertainties using a novel sorting loss. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on NYUD-v2, BSDS500, and Multi-cue datasets when RankED is integrated with Swin Transformer. The key terms reflect the main contributions and experimental results in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does RankED address the class imbalance problem in edge detection compared to prior methods like class-balanced cross entropy loss and dice loss? What is the intuition behind using a ranking-based loss to handle class imbalance?

2. Explain the formulation of the ranking loss L_{Rank} in RankED. In particular, discuss how average precision is approximated as a differentiable loss function using rank definitions. 

3. The sorting loss L_{Sort} in RankED aims to tackle label uncertainty. Explain how pixel-wise uncertainties are computed and incorporated into L_{Sort} to promote high confidence edge pixels.

4. Discuss the optimization strategy used for RankED. Why can't autograd be directly used for computing gradients of L_{Rank} and L_{Sort}? How is the gradient approximation computed?

5. Analyze the uncertainty-aware evaluation results reported in the paper. Why does RankED demonstrate improved performance at lower uncertainty levels? What does this indicate about the method's ability to handle label uncertainty?

6. Compare the qualitative edge detection results of RankED against prior state-of-the-art methods like HED, BDCN etc. What differences can be observed? Does RankED miss certain edge details?

7. How much speedup is obtained using the vectorized implementations of L_{Rank} and L_{Sort} compared to the official for-loop based versions? Why is this significant for adopting ranking losses?

8. Discuss the ablation study that validates using the proposed certainty map versus simply averaging multiple ground truth annotations. Why does directly averaging labels result in worse performance?

9. What is the effect of prioritizing high uncertainty pixels in the loss, as done in UAED, instead of low uncertainty pixels as in RankED? Justify the design choice made.

10. What directions for future work are identified in using RankED for edge detection? Could the ideas be extended to make post-processing steps differentiable?
