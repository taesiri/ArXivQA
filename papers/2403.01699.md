# [Brilla AI: AI Contestant for the National Science and Maths Quiz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There is a shortage of qualified teachers in Africa, hampering effective learning support for students. An AI teaching assistant could potentially help augment limited teaching workforces.  
- However, there are no robust real-world benchmarks to evaluate such AI solutions tailored to the African context. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge which proposes that an AI should compete and win against human contestants in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition. 
- As a first step towards this challenge, the authors build Brilla AI, an AI contestant that can compete in the Riddles round of NSMQ. 

Brilla AI System:
- It is an end-to-end system with 4 key components that work in real-time:
   1) Speech-to-text (STT): Transcribes audio of questions read with a Ghanaian accent
   2) Question extraction (QE): Detects start and end of each riddle and extracts clues
   3) Question answering (QA): Provides an answer to each riddle 
   4) Text-to-speech (TTS): Says the answer with a Ghanaian accent
- It is available as a web app with live and demo modes

Data Collection and Modeling:
- Curated dataset of NSMQ contests from 2012-2022, with video, text of questions, annotations etc.
- Custom models developed for STT, QE, QA and TTS that are tailored to the task and African context

Evaluation: 
- Objective metrics used to evaluate each component like word error rate, accuracy etc.
- End-to-end system deployed live in 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale
- Brilla AI answered 1 out of 4 riddles correctly, unofficially placing 2nd 

Key Contributions:
- First ever AI contestant to compete live in NSMQ Grand Finale
- Addresses unique challenges of African context - Ghanaian accented speech, science questions, education focus
- Detailed dataset, modeling and thorough evaluation of an end-to-end AI system on a real-world African benchmark
- Shows path towards democratizing science education at scale in Africa using AI

Limitations and Future Work:
- More data collection and model improvement needed 
- Pipeline optimization to reduce latency
- Plan to compete unofficially in more rounds in 2024 


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper describes Brilla AI, an AI system deployed to compete in the Riddles round of Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz competition, which answered one out of four riddles correctly ahead of the human teams in its debut, unofficially placing second.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

"The first end-to-end, real-time AI system deployed as an unofficial, AI contestant together with 3 human competing teams for the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale (the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition) that (1) transcribes Ghanaian-accented speech of scientific riddles, (2) extracts relevant portions of the riddles (clues) by inferring the start and end of each riddle and segmenting the clues, (3) provides an answer to the riddle, and (4) then says it with a Ghanaian accent."

In other words, the key contribution is building and deploying Brilla AI, an AI system that can compete in the Riddles round of Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz competition. It is the first AI contestant in the 30 year history of the competition. Brilla AI integrates speech-to-text, question extraction, question answering, and text-to-speech components to attempt to answer riddles by processing Ghanaian-accented speech in real-time during the live competition.

The paper describes the development of an AI system called Brilla AI to compete in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz competition. It utilizes natural language processing techniques like speech-to-text, question answering, text-to-speech, etc. to attempt to answer science and math questions. The goal is to build an AI teaching assistant that can support science education, particularly in the African context. Some key terms reflect the specific models and architectures used (BERT) while others describe the application area (science education, NSMQ) and context (Ghana, Africa).


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using both extractive QA and generative QA approaches for question answering. Can you explain in more detail the differences between these two approaches and why both were explored? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each?

2. The confidence modeling pipeline is used to decide when the QA system should attempt an answer. Can you explain this pipeline in more detail? How exactly does it work to produce a confidence estimate and decide when a threshold is met to attempt an answer? 

3. The paper compares performance to a human benchmark calculated from annotations about which clue the students answered on. What exactly does this benchmark represent and why is it an appropriate comparison to judge the AI's performance?

4. The question extraction system uses a BERT model fine-tuned to classify text chunks as clues or non-clues. What was the training data used and what was the model architecture and training procedure? How well does it generalize to new unseen data?

5. The paper mentions parallelizing operations to remove bottlenecks and latency issues. What specifically causes these issues and where are the bottlenecks? How could operations be parallelized to improve real-time performance?

6. For the speech-to-text system, why was the Medium (English) Whisper model chosen over other options? What is the tradeoff it offers between WER and latency? How could the model be improved with more training data?

7. What causes the speech-to-text transcriptions to sometimes be inaccurate or lag behind the live video stream? How can this issue be addressed to enable the system to keep up in real-time?  

8. For the text-to-speech system, why does it struggle with synthesizing scientific and mathematical text compared to conversational speech? How can the model be improved to handle such text better?

9. The system architecture has separate modules for the various tasks. Would an end-to-end model architecture be feasible or better suited for this task? What are the tradeoffs?

10. The paper mentions using reinforcement learning to improve the confidence modeling. Can you explain how reinforcement learning could be applied in this context and what additional information it could exploit?
