# [Local Binary and Multiclass SVMs Trained on a Quantum Annealer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08584)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Quantum-trained support vector machines (SVMs) have shown comparable performance to classical SVMs. However, they are limited in the training set size they can handle due to the restricted connectivity of current quantum annealers used for training. This prevents them from taking advantage of large datasets, which are common in domains like remote sensing.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a local approach to apply quantum-trained SVMs, specifically a binary SVM (QBSVM) and a multiclass SVM (QMSVM). The idea is to use a method called FaLK-SVM that builds local SVM models centered around different training samples and uses them to classify new test samples based on locality. This allows overcoming the quantum annealer's connectivity constraints.

Contributions:

- Interfaces FaLK-SVM with QBSVM and QMSVM to enable local application of quantum-trained models
- Compares local quantum-trained SVMs with local classical SVMs 
- Analyzes performance scaling of local classical SVMs on larger datasets as an indicator of quantum model performance
- Empirically evaluates approach on remote sensing datasets using D-Wave quantum annealers
- Shows local QBSVM and QMSVM achieve comparable or slightly better performance than local classical counterparts
- Demonstrates practical applicability of local QMSVM in a large-scale remote sensing scenario

In summary, the paper introduces and validates a local approach to apply quantum-trained SVMs to overcome connectivity constraints and leverage larger datasets. The results on remote sensing data indicate local quantum-trained SVMs can achieve performance close to classical local SVMs and scale to real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes and evaluates a method to apply quantum-trained support vector machines locally, enabling their usage on large datasets and enhancing their performance, with experiments in remote sensing showing comparable results to classical counterparts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and empirically evaluating the local application of quantum-trained support vector machine (SVM) models for binary and multiclass classification. Specifically, the paper interfaces an efficient method for local SVMs called FaLK-SVM with a quantum-trained SVM for binary classification (QBSVM) and a quantum-trained SVM for multiclass classification (QMSVM). The goal is to enable the usage of quantum-trained SVMs on large datasets and enhance their performance through locality. The results on remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the local quantum-trained SVMs achieving comparable or better performance than their classical counterparts. The paper also shows the practical applicability of local quantum-trained SVMs, especially the multiclass one, in a large-scale real-world scenario. In summary, the key contribution is introducing and assessing a strategy to address the training set size limitations of current quantum-trained SVMs by applying them locally.
