# [eDiff-I: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with an Ensemble of Expert   Denoisers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01324)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces a new text-to-image diffusion model called eDiff-I that uses an ensemble of expert denoisers specialized for different stages of the image generation process. The central hypothesis is that text-to-image diffusion models exhibit different behaviors at different noise levels during the iterative image generation process. At early stages, the model relies more heavily on the text prompt to generate the overall structure and content. At later stages, the model ignores the text and focuses more on generating high visual quality.The key research questions addressed are:1) Can using an ensemble of expert denoisers, each specialized for certain noise levels, improve text-to-image generation compared to using a single shared model? 2) How do different text embeddings like CLIP and T5 influence the image generation process and how can using them jointly lead to better results?3) Can conditioning on CLIP image embeddings enable intuitive style transfer for text-to-image synthesis?4) How can the model be extended to allow spatial layout control through a "paint-with-words" capability?The central hypothesis is tested through quantitative metrics and human evaluation, indicating improved text-alignment and image quality from the proposed ensemble model. The other research questions are addressed through ablation studies and qualitative examples demonstrating the capabilities enabled by using different conditioning signals.In summary, the core focus is improving text-to-image diffusion models by using expert denoisers tailored to different generative stages and exploring how different conditioning signals influence image synthesis.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other recent research in text-to-image generation using diffusion models:- The main contribution is developing an ensemble of expert denoisers specialized for different stages of the iterative diffusion sampling process. This builds on prior work like DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion, but proposes a novel way to scale up model capacity without increasing inference cost. - It explores using different text embeddings like CLIP and T5 as conditional inputs. DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion use CLIP embeddings, while Imagen uses T5 embeddings. This paper shows benefits from combining both CLIP and T5 embeddings.- It demonstrates applications like style transfer by conditioning on CLIP image embeddings and "paint with words" spatial layout control. These build on capabilities explored in other recent papers, but the specific techniques here appear novel.- The overall results and image quality seem competitive with recent top models like Imagen and Stable Diffusion v2. The FID scores are very close to the current state-of-the-art.- The model architecture follows a similar overall framework as recent models, using a cascaded diffusion model with a base text-conditioned model and super-resolution modules. But specifics like the attention blocks and training procedures are customized.- The training data and compute scale seems comparable to related work, using around 1 billion text-image pairs and hundreds of GPUs. Data filtering and training efficiency considerations are also discussed.In summary, this paper pushes forward text-to-image generation quality with its proposed expert ensemble technique and exploration of conditioning modalities. The results are state-of-the-art, while building nicely on related previous research. The applications like style transfer and spatial layout control also showcase interesting new capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Investigating other types of expert ensembles besides the binary tree partitioning scheme explored in this work. The authors mention other possible partitioning schemes like uniformly spaced intervals.- Exploring the benefits of having specialized experts beyond just high and low noise levels. For example, having experts specialized for particular semantic concepts. - Extending the paint-with-words method to support more fine-grained spatial layout control, like being able to specify object sizes and shapes.- Improving the spatial disentanglement of generated images to enable more controllable editing after generation.- Exploring other novel ways of providing conditional inputs in addition to text and images, like sketches or spatial layouts.- Scaling up the model size and training data further to continue improving image quality and text comprehension.- Reducing bias and problematic content in the training data through better filtering and sourcing.- Developing techniques to make the model outputs more amenable to semantic editing after generation.- Applying the model to various downstream applications like content creation, slogan design, illustration generation etc.In summary, the authors suggest future work on exploring different expert ensemble designs, improving spatial control over layout, scaling up the model, reducing bias, enabling better editing, and applying the model to novel use cases. The overarching theme is continued progress on controllable high-fidelity text-to-image generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new text-to-image diffusion model called eDiff-I which uses an ensemble of expert denoisers specialized for different stages of the iterative image generation process. The key insight is that text-to-image diffusion models exhibit different behaviors at different noise levels - relying more on text conditioning early on to create the overall structure, and later focusing on image details while ignoring the text. To capture these distinct modes, the authors train multiple denoising models, each specialized for a subset of noise levels. This ensemble approach boosts performance without increasing inference cost. The model is conditioned on text embeddings from both T5 and CLIP during training. Using both embeddings gives complementary benefits - T5 focuses on fine details while CLIP determines the overall image structure. The model can also take CLIP image embeddings as input to perform style transfer. An extension enables "painting with words" by attending to user-drawn semantic masks. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on COCO and improved text alignment over baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble denoising approach.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes eDiff-I, a new text-to-image diffusion model that consists of a base diffusion model and two super-resolution models to generate high-resolution 1024x1024 images. The key idea is to use an ensemble of expert denoisers specialized for different stages of the iterative image generation process. The authors observe that text-to-image diffusion models exhibit different behaviors at different noise levels - relying more on text conditioning early on to determine overall structure, and more on image features later to add fine details. To capture this, they propose training multiple expert denoisers, each specialized for a noise level interval. This improves results without increasing inference cost. The model is trained efficiently by progressively splitting a single pre-trained model into specialized experts.The paper also explores using different text embeddings from CLIP and T5 to condition the model, finding they lead to different image formation behaviors. CLIP text embedding helps determine global image structure while T5 embedding reflects fine details better. Using both jointly works best. The CLIP image embedding can also be used to enable intuitive style transfer to the generated image. Lastly, the authors propose a paint-with-words method to allow spatial layout control by selecting phrases in the text prompt and scribbling their desired locations. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art text-to-image generation, controllable style transfer, and improved user control. The model's specialized expert denoisers are key to its strong performance and generation capabilities.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes an ensemble of expert denoisers for text-to-image diffusion models. The key idea is that text-to-image diffusion models exhibit different behaviors at different noise levels during the image generation process. At high noise levels, the model relies more on text conditioning to create the overall structure and content. At low noise levels, the model mostly ignores text and focuses on generating high visual quality. To capture these distinct behaviors, the authors train specialized denoising models for different noise intervals using a binary tree structure. They first train a single baseline model and then progressively split it into child models trained on subsets of the noise levels. This allows efficiently training an ensemble of expert denoisers tailored to different stages of generation, improving results without increasing inference cost. The model also uses an ensemble of text encoders (CLIP and T5) and allows conditioning on CLIP image embeddings for style control.
