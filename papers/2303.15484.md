# [Regularize implicit neural representation by itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15484)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we improve the generalization ability of implicit neural representations (INRs) for representing signals, especially with non-uniformly sampled data? 

The key points are:

- INRs using fully connected networks can represent signals without being limited by grid resolution, but their generalization ability could be improved. 

- This paper proposes a novel regularizer called Implicit Neural Representation Regularizer (INRR) to improve INR generalization. 

- INRR is based on modeling similarities between rows/columns of data matrices using learned Dirichlet energy. It also imposes smoothness of the Laplacian matrix by parameterizing it with a small INR.

- This integration of self-similarity and Laplacian smoothness in INRR is aimed at improving INR generalization for signal representation tasks like image inpainting.

- Experiments show INRR outperforms other regularizers and improves INR generalization with non-uniform sampling. The paper also analyzes properties of INRR like implicit bias and multi-scale similarity capture.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that the proposed INRR regularizer can enhance generalization of INRs for signal representation, especially with irregularly sampled data. The paper presents INRR and validates its performance empirically.
