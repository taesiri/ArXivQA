# [Evaluating Dependencies in Fact Editing for Language Models: Specificity   and Implication Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01858)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new evaluation protocol and accompanying dataset called LogicalKnowEdit for assessing knowledge editing methods in large language models (LLMs). The key innovation is evaluating editing methods along two key dimensions: specificity, which requires edits to only apply to the target facts and close variants; and implication awareness, which requires properly updating logically entailed facts based on rules. The paper introduces the "establish-and-update" protocol which tests editing methods by first establishing facts and rules in an LLM, then updating some facts and evaluating changes. Experiments on the new dataset reveal current editing techniques struggle with implication awareness - they fail to properly update entailed facts based on linguistic rules. The analysis suggests models have difficulty identifying the right gradient direction to update parameters to reflect rule-based implications. The paper concludes by proposing the integration of techniques from classical knowledge bases as a promising direction to address these challenges.
