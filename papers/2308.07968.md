# [Teach LLMs to Personalize -- An Approach inspired by Writing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07968)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a general approach for personalized text generation using large language models (LLMs)?

The key points about the research question:

- The paper aims to develop an approach for personalized text generation that is general and works across different domains/tasks, rather than being tailored to a specific domain. 

- The approach relies on using large language models (LLMs) as the underlying generative model. 

- The goal is to teach the LLMs how to generate personalized text by incorporating a user's personal context.

So in summary, the main research question is how to create a general framework leveraging LLMs to achieve personalized text generation by taking into account a user's personal context. The paper proposes a multi-stage, multi-task approach inspired by writing education to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a multistage multitask framework for teaching large language models to generate personalized text. The key ideas are:

1. A multistage framework inspired by writing instruction that includes retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and generation steps. This helps decompose the complex personalized generation task.

2. A multitask learning approach with an auxiliary author distinction task to improve the model's ability to understand a user's writing style and generate better personalized content. 

3. Evaluation on three diverse datasets showing significant improvements over various baselines.

In summary, the paper proposes a general approach for personalized text generation that trains large language models through a sequence of related tasks analogous to how students develop writing skills. The multitask learning further helps the model capture nuances of personal style by jointly training on an authorship identification task. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a general multistage multitask framework for teaching large language models to generate personalized text. The key idea is to decompose the generation process into multiple steps - retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and finally generation - inspired by how students are taught to write from sources. An auxiliary authorship distinction task is added to improve the model's reading comprehension ability, based on the observation that reading and writing skills are correlated. The approach is evaluated on three datasets and shows significant gains over baselines.

In one sentence, the paper teaches large language models to generate personalized text through a framework inspired by writing education, with multitask learning to improve reading comprehension.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in personalized text generation:

- Most prior work focuses on a particular domain or task, designing bespoke features or models. In contrast, this paper proposes a general framework applicable across domains.

- Many existing approaches rely on domain-specific knowledge or predefined attributes for personalization. This paper instead utilizes a user's past writings without needing any explicit attributes. 

- The proposed multi-stage approach draws inspiration from writing instruction practices. It decomposes the task into retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis and generation. This is a unique angle compared to typical end-to-end neural generation models.

- The multi-task learning with an auxiliary author distinction task is novel. It is motivated by education research showing reading and writing skills are correlated.

- Unlike most personalized generation papers that only report results on a single dataset, this work evaluates on 3 diverse datasets. The consistent gains demonstrate the generalizability.

- The only work with a similar goal is LaMP. But LaMP focuses on sentence-level generation. This paper tackles the more challenging passage-level generation where personalization is more critical.

- Method-wise, LaMP can be viewed as an instantiation of the retrieval component in the proposed framework. This paper explores more sophisticated strategies for retrieval, ranking, summarization and synthesis.

In summary, the key distinctions of this work are the generalizable multi-stage framework drawing from education practices, the multi-task learning setup, and the comprehensive evaluation across diverse domains and datasets. The paper makes good incremental research progress in teaching LLMs to generate personalized text.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Incorporating world knowledge into the models, such as product attributes and features for product reviews. The authors mention this could be a promising direction to further improve personalized text generation.

- Exploring more sophisticated approaches to the synthesis stage beyond just extracting keywords. The authors note that their keyword extraction method for synthesis mainly helped improve the Rouge-1 score, so more advanced synthesis techniques could help boost other metrics.

- Developing methods that can scale to a large number of users. The authors point out that most prior work has focused on personalization with a limited number of users.

- Extending the approach to other types of personalized content generation beyond passages, such as emails, dialogue, tweets etc. The authors formulate their method for passage-level generation but suggest it could be applicable to other text types.

- Applying the approach to other domains beyond the three evaluated in the paper (emails, reviews, social media). The authors propose their framework as a general approach for personalized text generation.

- Exploring personalization in other generation tasks like summarization, translation, style transfer. The authors suggest their techniques could be relevant for other generation applications needing personalization.

- Studying personalization in few-shot settings with limited user data. The authors assume a certain level of user data is available, but adapting to low-resource scenarios could be important.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more sophisticated synthesis techniques, scaling to more users, extending to other text types and domains, and studying personalization in other generation tasks and low-data settings. The core idea of their staged framework seems promising to build on in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a general approach for teaching large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized text. Inspired by writing instruction practices, the approach consists of multiple stages - retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and generation. Given an immediate context such as a document title and initial sentences, relevant entries are retrieved from the user's previous writings. The entries are ranked, summarized, and synthesized into key elements. These outputs are then fed into the LLM for generating personalized text. Additionally, a multitask learning approach is introduced where the LLM is also trained on an authorship attribution task to improve its reading comprehension ability and in turn its generation performance. The models are evaluated on three public datasets from different domains and show significant improvements over various baselines.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multistage multitask framework to teach large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized text. The approach is inspired by writing education practices that decompose writing from sources into multiple steps (retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, generation).  

First, given the immediate context (title and starting sentences of a document), relevant entries are retrieved from the user's previous documents. The entries are ranked, summarized, and synthesized into key elements. All this information is fed into the LLM for personalized document generation. Additionally, a multitask setting is introduced where the LLM is also trained on an author distinction task to improve its reading comprehension. This is motivated by the observation that reading and writing skills are correlated. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms baselines. The multistage decomposition and multitask learning are shown to be effective for teaching LLMs to generate personalized text.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a multistage multitask framework for teaching large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized text. The method is inspired by writing instruction practices that decompose the task into multiple steps - retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and generation. For a given user, the model first retrieves and ranks relevant passages from the user's previous writings. It then summarizes and synthesizes key information from the retrieved passages. These components, along with the prompt, are fed to the LLM to generate personalized text. Additionally, a multitask learning approach is used where the model jointly learns the generation task along with an authorship identification task, which helps improve its ability to capture personal style. The models are evaluated on three public datasets from different domains and show significant improvements over various baselines.
