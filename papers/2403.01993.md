# [Physics-Informed Learning for Time-Resolved Angiographic Contrast Agent   Concentration Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is used to visualize blood vessels and diagnose vascular diseases. However, conventional DSA only provides static 3D images or time-resolved 2D images, both of which have limitations. 
- Reconstructing time-resolved 3D DSA (4D-DSA) from a single rotational acquisition allows visualizing dynamic contrast flow but is an ill-posed inverse problem due to vessel overlap and foreshortening in projections.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a learning-based 1D+time reduced order model to efficiently reconstruct mean contrast agent (CA) concentrations over vessel cross sections and time from 2D projections.
- A dataset of rotational angiography acquisitions is simulated using computational fluid dynamics, modeling realistic CA transport physics. CA concentrations over centerlines constitute ground truth.  
- A CNN is trained on this dataset to learn the mapping between simulated 2D projections and 1D+time CA concentrations, implicitly encoding physics constraints.

Contributions:
- First learning-based model for time-resolved angiographic flow reconstruction. Computational efficiency enabled by 1D approximation.
- Quantitative evaluation on simulated test set shows excellent performance in reconstructing CA concentrations with mean absolute error of 0.02 and mean absolute percentage error of 5.31%.
- Model demonstrates robustness to varying degrees of vessel overlap and foreshortening.
- Study demonstrates feasibility of integrating machine learning with blood flow simulations for angiographic reconstruction problems.

In summary, the paper presents a novel data-driven approach to efficiently reconstruct dynamic CA flow from rotational angiography acquisitions by learning from realistic flow simulations. It also validates the model performance quantitatively on simulated data.
