# [At the junction between deep learning and statistics of extremes:   formalizing the landslide hazard definition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Landslide hazard modelling typically only covers spatial landslide susceptibility and intensity, but not temporal frequency. Jointly modelling all components in a unified framework has been challenging.
- Landslide intensity (size/destructiveness) is rarely modelled as a function of environmental conditions. Intensity and susceptibility are often treated separately.
- Modelling tail extremes and extrapolating hazard to yet unobserved conditions/scenarios is difficult with standard methods.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a statistical deep learning model that jointly estimates landslide susceptibility (probability of occurrence) and intensity (probability of exceeding a critical landslide size) as functions of static and dynamic covariates.
- Model intensity using the flexible extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (eGPD) from extreme value theory to capture tail behaviour and enable extrapolation.  
- Incorporate trigger (rainfall) frequency by modelling return levels and simulating hazard under extreme rainfall scenarios of specified return periods.

Key Contributions:
- First unified statistical framework that formally complies with the complete landslide hazard definition, linking susceptibility, intensity conditioned on covariates, and trigger frequency.
- Novel use of eGPD and deep learning framework to flexibly model bulk and tail behaviour of landslide intensity component.
- Demonstration of framework via application to 30-year Nepal inventory. Hazard maps produced for historical period and climate change projections.
- Model is computationally efficient and can scale to large spatiotemporal regions for global application.
- Outputs hazard maps for a range of severity levels and return periods to support risk assessments and planning decisions.

In summary, the paper proposes an important advancement in landslide hazard modelling methodology through a flexible deep statistical approach that links all components of the hazard definition.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper develops a novel statistical deep learning model to estimate the spatial and temporal landslide hazard by jointly modeling landslide susceptibility and intensity as well as incorporating the frequency of triggering events through return period analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a novel statistical deep learning framework to model landslide hazard in a unified manner. Specifically:

- It combines deep learning with a model motivated by extreme value theory (the extended Generalized Pareto distribution) to jointly estimate landslide susceptibility and intensity (size) while accounting for their dependence. 

- It models landslide intensity using the eGPD distribution, which can capture both tail behaviors as well as the bulk of the distribution in a parsimonious yet flexible way.

- It incorporates the frequency of the landslide triggering events (rainfall extremes) by estimating return levels and simulating hazard under specified return periods. This allows assessing potential future hazard under different scenarios.

- It applies the framework to 30 years of landslide data in Nepal to estimate hazard for different rainfall return periods. It also projects future hazard under different climate change pathways.

In summary, the key innovation is a unified statistical deep learning framework for spatio-temporal landslide hazard estimation that combines susceptibility, intensity/size, and trigger frequency in a novel way compared to previous works. The application to model current and future landslide hazard in Nepal showcases the capabilities.

The paper develops a deep learning-based statistical framework to model landslide hazard by combining ideas from extreme value theory with the typical components of hazard - namely susceptibility, intensity/size, and frequency. The model is demonstrated over 30 years of landslide data in Nepal using slope units as the spatial mapping unit. Key innovations include the use of the flexible eGPD model to characterize landslide intensity, return period modeling to account for trigger frequency, and simulation under climate change scenarios.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that the proposed model formally satisfies the landslide hazard definition proposed by Guzzetti et al. (1999) for the first time in a single architecture. What are the key components of this hazard definition and how does the proposed model address each one? 

2. The paper uses an extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (eGPD) to model the intensity (size) of landslides. What are the main benefits of using the eGPD over other distributions for this application? How does it help with extrapolation and estimation of more extreme landslide intensities?

3. The neural network architecture has two output layers, one for the susceptibility parameter $p(s,t)$ and one for the scale parameter $\sigma(s,t)$ of the landslide intensity model. Why is a shared architecture with these two outputs a sensible choice? What is the implication of assuming the parameters are correlated?

4. The loss function consists of two weighted components, one related to the Bernoulli likelihood for the binary landslide occurrence variable, and one related to the eGPD negative log-likelihood. What role does the weight $\gamma$ play in balancing these two? How should this parameter be tuned?

5. Return levels for the precipitation trigger are estimated using a separate eGPD model. What are the benefits of building a tailored extreme value model here rather than simply plugging in the estimated return levels into the landslide model inputs?

6. The paper argues that using return levels of the triggering events allows one to compute hazard for scenarios where the trigger reaches specified extreme levels. How does this differ from prior works and what additional information does it provide for landslide hazard analyses?

7. Aside from precipitation data, what other types of triggering factors could be included and how might the return level and hazard estimation be adjusted to account for multiple triggers? What are some of the open challenges here?

8. The slope units used have a complex geometry compared to regular grid cells. How were these slope units derived? What impact might the choice of terrain partitioning have on the final hazard model?

9. The model is trained on 30 years of mapped landslide data. What impact could inventory biases and mapping errors have on the quality of the final hazard model? How might the model predictions change if trained on higher quality data?

10. The model is used to estimate potential changes in landslide hazard under different climate change scenarios. What are some of the major assumptions and sources of uncertainty when making projections this way? How could the uncertainty in future hazard projections be quantified?
