# [Improving Fairness in Credit Lending Models using Subgroup Threshold   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10652)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models used for credit lending decisions can demonstrate bias against certain subgroups, leading to unfair outcomes. For example, models may wrongly deny loans to creditworthy females more often than creditworthy males.
- Contributing factors include historical bias in training data and legal requirements to exclude protected attributes like gender. Counterintuitively, excluding gender can increase discrimination against subgroups. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new technique called Subgroup Threshold Optimization (STO) to improve fairness by adjusting thresholds for probability estimates on a per-subgroup basis. 
- STO defines a discrimination score to quantify predictive performance differences between subgroups. It then finds optimal thresholds to minimize discrimination score between a "dominating" subgroup and others.
- STO is flexible to work with any ML model as a post-processing step, allows human-in-the-loop configuration, and does not require access to training data or models.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces the concept of subgroup-based performance metrics and discrimination score to quantify model fairness
- Proposes STO technique to adjust thresholds and optimize subgroup performance measures 
- Demonstrates STO's ability to improve fairness by over 90% in experiments on real-world lending data
- Highlights interpretability, flexibility, and accessibility of STO for industry practitioners
- Discusses extensions for financial outcome modeling, synthetic dataset generation, and further enhancements of the technique

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions towards improving fairness in credit lending models by proposing STO, validating it empirically, and positioning it as an interpretable and flexible technique accessible to industry practitioners.
