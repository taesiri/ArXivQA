# [EffiVED:Efficient Video Editing via Text-instruction Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11568)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "EffiVED: Efficient Video Editing via Text-instruction Diffusion Models":

Problem:
- Text-to-video diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in video generation, but their direct application in video editing remains challenging due to limited available datasets. 
- Current video editing methods require per-video fine-tuning or inversion optimization to ensure high-fidelity edits, which is computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose EffiVED, an efficient diffusion-based model that directly supports instruction-guided video editing without needing per-video tuning.

Key Ideas:
- Develop two efficient workflows to gather video editing pairs, transforming image editing datasets and open-world videos into high-quality training data.
- One workflow applies augmentations like rotations and crops to image editing pairs to simulate camera motion and generate video triplets. 
- Another workflow uses a large language model, VideoBLIP, CoCa and CoDeF to generate captions, instructions and corresponding edited videos from real-world videos.
- Train a conditional 3D U-Net diffusion model, EffiVED, on this collected dataset to directly edit videos based on text instructions.
- Decouple classifier-free guidance into separate text and visual guidance to independently control the editing process.

Main Contributions:
- Two workflows to effectively convert image and video datasets into high-quality training data for video editing.
- EffiVED model that accomplishes a wide range of editing tasks at very fast speed, around 6-28x faster than current approaches.
- Demonstrated that the data collection strategy significantly improves editing performance, helping mitigate the scarcity of video editing training data.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient way to train a text-guided video editing model without needing per-video fine-tuning, enabling practical applications. The key innovation is in strategically leveraging multiple datasets and models to create a robust training dataset.
