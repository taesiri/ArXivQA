# [Using Analytics on Student Created Data to Content Validate Pedagogical   Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06871)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Simulation models are becoming popular pedagogical tools but there is a lack of validity evidence showing these tools actually resemble the domain they aim to represent. 
- Specifically for the Virtual Ecological Research Assistant (VERA) tool, it is unclear if the simulation outputs match common ecological population curves that students learn about in biology classes.

Proposed Solution:  
- Develop a methodology to demonstrate content validity of simulation-based educational tools by showing convergence between unsupervised clustering methods and supervised classification methods.
- Apply this methodology to VERA by using hierarchical clustering (unsupervised) and curve fitting (supervised) to categorize the simulation output time series into common ecological curve types. 

Data:
- Extracted time series data from VERA models created by students at Georgia Tech, North Georgia Technical College ecology students, and self-directed learners. In total 263 models and 971 time series.

Methods:
- Normalized time series data and cut to uniform 400 time steps 
- Performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering with dynamic time warping distance
- Labeled clusters by fitting known ecological curves (logistic, exponential, sinusoids, etc.)
- Validated clusters on test set using 1-nearest neighbor on cluster medoids

Results:
- Hierarchical clustering and curve fitting methods agreed on labels 89.38% of the time
- More agreement on larger dataset from all VERA users compared to individual student groups

Contributions:
- Demonstrated a methodology to assess content validity of simulation-based educational tools through convergence of unsupervised and supervised classification
- Showed VERA simulation outputs match common ecological curves, providing validity evidence for use of VERA in biology courses
- Output labels can help students conceptualize model behaviors and provide foundation for an intelligent tutoring system in VERA
