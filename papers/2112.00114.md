# [Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00114)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether Transformer-based language models can perform better on complex multi-step computations by being asked to show their work step-by-step in a "scratchpad", rather than being asked to directly predict the output. 

The key hypothesis is that allowing models to produce intermediate steps of a computation in a scratchpad will improve their ability to perform tasks requiring unbounded multi-step reasoning, such as integer addition, polynomial evaluation, and predicting the output of arbitrary computer programs. 

The authors test this by designing tasks that require the model to emit textual representations of intermediate computational states into a scratchpad, before producing the final output. They compare scratchpad performance to direct prediction on several tasks, and find that the scratchpad approach dramatically improves performance, especially on out-of-distribution examples requiring more steps of reasoning.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that Transformer language models can learn to perform complex computations more effectively if they are asked to show their work in a scratchpad, compared to being asked to directly predict outputs. The experiments across addition, polynomial evaluation, and program execution aim to test this hypothesis.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether Transformer-based language models can perform better on complex multi-step computations if they are asked to show their work "step-by-step" in a scratchpad, rather than make predictions in one shot. 

The authors hypothesize that allowing models to produce intermediate steps of a computation in a scratchpad buffer will improve their ability to perform tasks that require unbounded computation, such as integer addition, polynomial evaluation, and executing arbitrary computer programs. Their rationale is that the scratchpad allows models to dedicate an adaptive amount of computation to harder sub-tasks, refer back to intermediate states, and mitigate error propagation.

To test this hypothesis, the authors train Transformer language models on various algorithmic tasks, comparing standard "one-shot" prediction to prediction with a scratchpad. The key experiments show that across tasks of increasing complexity, from integer addition to program execution, scratchpads consistently and significantly improve model performance, especially on larger problem instances and with limited training data.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that scratchpads can dramatically improve the ability of Transformer language models to perform complex, multi-step computations requiring unbounded resources, without changes to model architecture. The paper aims to demonstrate this via experiments on diverse algorithmic tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces the notion of using a "scratchpad" with Transformer language models to improve their ability to perform complex multi-step computations. The key ideas are:

- Allowing models to produce an arbitrary sequence of intermediate tokens called a "scratchpad" before producing the final output. For example, on addition problems the scratchpad would contain the intermediate steps of a long addition algorithm. 

- Encoding the intermediate steps of algorithms as text and training models to generate them, using standard supervised learning.

- Evaluating this approach on tasks ranging from long addition to executing arbitrary Python code.

The main findings are:

- Using a scratchpad significantly improves Transformers' ability to do long addition, especially for large numbers.

- Scratchpads also improve polynomial evaluation, in both few-shot and fine-tuning settings.

- Allowing models to predict execution traces of programs line-by-line, with intermediate states, dramatically improves execution prediction compared to direct prediction.

- Models can learn to trace programs well when trained on diverse sources of tracing data.

In summary, the main contribution is showing that allowing Transformer language models to show their work in a scratchpad enables much better performance on tasks requiring unbounded multi-step computation, without changing the model architecture. This could enable better reasoning capabilities for large pre-trained models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing the idea of a "scratchpad" for Transformers to allow them to perform complex multi-step computations. The scratchpad allows the model to show intermediate steps in a computation before outputting the final result.

2. Demonstrating that using a scratchpad improves Transformer performance on a variety of algorithmic reasoning tasks:

- Addition: Scratchpads help Transformers learn long addition, especially for large numbers outside the training distribution.

- Polynomial evaluation: Scratchpads improve few-shot and fine-tuned performance.

- Executing Python code: Training Transformers to emit program traces into a scratchpad dramatically improves their ability to predict program outputs. This is shown on both synthetic and real Python programs.

3. Showing that the scratchpad approach scales well with more training data from additional sources. Adding more tracing data from sources like CodeNet and single-line Python programs further improves performance.

4. The results indicate that the scratchpad technique allows Transformers to perform complex multi-step computations without needing to modify the underlying model architecture. This is a simple but effective technique to improve Transformers on tasks requiring algorithmic reasoning.

In summary, the core contribution is introducing scratchpads to help Transformers perform multi-step algorithmic computations, and showing this improves performance on a diverse set of tasks including arithmetic, polynomial evaluation, and program execution. The results suggest scratchpads could be useful for making Transformers better at semantic reasoning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The main contribution of this paper is introducing the notion of a "scratchpad" for Transformers to improve their ability to perform complex multi-step computations. This is a novel technique not explored in prior work. Most prior work has focused on modifying the underlying neural architecture rather than the task formulation.

- The paper shows the scratchpad technique is effective across a diverse set of tasks including addition, polynomial evaluation, and program execution. This demonstrates the general applicability of the approach beyond a narrow task. 

- The scratchpad technique allows standard Transformer models to be leveraged without architectural modifications. Other work like neural Turing machines or neural GPUs propose new specialized architectures. The scratchpad could complement these specialized models as well.

- The program execution experiments connect to an active research area on neural execution of programs. Prior work in this area has shown Transformers perform poorly on execution tasks. This paper shows the scratchpad technique substantially improves execution prediction, advancing the state-of-the-art.

- The paper examines how predictive performance scales with dataset size. The experiments combining multiple training data sources demonstrate the scratchpad technique effectively leverages more data. This contrasts with specialized models like NTMs where data efficiency is a key motivation.

- The improved generalization out-of-distribution in the addition experiments is noteworthy. Other work has focused on in-distribution generalization, while extrapolation is known to be challenging for neural networks. The scratchpad may encourage more systematic generalization.

Overall, introducing the scratchpad technique is a novel contribution distinct from prior work. The paper makes excellent progress on long-standing challenges like neural program execution using standard Transformer models. The generality and scalability demonstrated are also important strengths compared to prior specialized neural architectures for algorithmic tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in program execution and reasoning with neural networks:

- The main novelty of this paper is using the "scratchpad" technique to help Transformers perform complex multi-step computations, without having to modify the underlying model architecture. This is a simple but clever idea. Previous work like Neural Turing Machines or Universal Transformers required designing new model architectures to support things like external memory and adaptive computation time. This paper shows existing models can be adapted by just changing the task formulation.

- The paper builds directly on prior work like Austin et al. (2021) that showed pre-trained language models struggle to predict program execution traces. By framing execution as a step-by-step tracing task and using a scratchpad, this paper is able to dramatically improve execution prediction on those same datasets and models.

- Several prior papers have explored specialized architectures for learning to execute code, like NTM or NGPU. This paper doesn't propose a new model architecture. Instead, it shows that existing models can learn to execute code well when aided by the scratchpad, reducing the need for specialized architectures.

- For the task of neural program synthesis, there's been work using specialized inductive biases like recursion (Chen et al. 2021), type constraints (Polosukhin & Skidanov, 2018), or structured representations (Shin et al., 2019). By contrast, this paper uses a general-purpose Transformer with no modifications. The scratchpad approach seems to work well for program execution despite the lack of inductive bias.

- Work on semantic parsing has also connected natural language to executable programs, but typically uses meaning representations like logical forms rather than raw code. The scratchpad approach operates directly on source code, which is more flexible.

Overall, a key contribution seems to be showing that multi-step computation in large language models can be dramatically improved using only changes to the training formulation, without any model architecture changes. The simplicity of the approach is noteworthy compared to prior work requiring specialized architectures. The paper also makes good connections to bodies of work on program execution, algorithm learning, and semantic parsing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to support even longer scratchpad generations beyond the current 512 token limit. The authors note that increasing the transformer generation window size is an active area of NLP research, and improvements here would benefit the scratchpad technique.

- Learning to use the scratchpad without direct supervision. The authors suggest using reinforcement learning where models are rewarded for correctly answering questions using fewer scratchpad tokens. The goal would be for models to learn transferable scratchpad skills.

- Applying the scratchpad technique to additional tasks like program synthesis, program analysis, and as an interactive programming assistant. The authors see promise in combining language models' knowledge with reasoning enabled by the scratchpad.

- Exploring alternate sequence models besides Transformers for the scratchpad, such as encoder-decoder models or recurrent networks. The core idea could potentially transfer to other architectures. 

- Reducing the impact of scratchpad training on few-shot performance on other tasks. The authors found a drop in few-shot synthesis capability after scratchpad training. Mitigating this could improve multi-tasking.

- Applying the scratchpad technique to symbolic mathematics, logic, and other technical domains involving complex step-by-step reasoning.

In summary, key directions are improving the scalability of scratchpads, transferring scratchpad skills efficiently, applying the technique to new domains, and integrating it effectively into multi-task models. The authors seem optimistic about the potential to combine language model knowledge with algorithmic reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing methods to increase the context window size that Transformers can process. The scratchpad technique is currently limited by the maximum context length Transformers can handle. The authors suggest improving context lengths could help the scratchpad approach scale to more complex computations.

- Exploring ways for models to learn to use the scratchpad without direct supervision. The authors suggest trying reinforcement learning where models are rewarded for correctly answering questions while using fewer scratchpad tokens.

- Applying the scratchpad technique to other domains beyond basic arithmetic, polynomial evaluation, and Python program execution. The authors suggest the scratchpad could be useful for program synthesis, program analysis, and building interactive programming assistants.

- Combining the knowledge compression abilities of large language models with reasoning capabilities to build models that truly understand code. The authors suggest the scratchpad technique could be an important step toward this goal.

- Reducing the amount of training data needed and enabling few-shot learning of scratchpad skills. The current work relies on full supervision, but learning to effectively use the scratchpad with less supervision could improve transfer of skills.

- Exploring whether the scratchpad technique can enable models to learn more systematic and generalizable representations of programs. The authors suggest this could lead to improved algorithmic reasoning abilities.

In summary, the main future directions are developing methods to scale up the approach, combining knowledge and reasoning, reducing supervision requirements, and applying the technique to new domains and tasks. The overarching goal is enabling deeper program understanding and reasoning by neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the notion of a "scratchpad" for Transformer models to improve their ability to perform complex multi-step computations without modifying the underlying architecture. The authors show that adding a scratchpad that models can read from and write intermediate steps to helps them better learn tasks like long addition, polynomial evaluation, and predicting the output of executing arbitrary Python programs. The scratchpad allows models to have adaptive computation time based on problem difficulty, store intermediate state explicitly to avoid compounding errors, and provides more interpretable intermediate outputs that can be used to identify and correct errors. Experiments demonstrate that scratchpads substantially improve model performance on these tasks compared to standard approaches, especially for generalizing to more complex unseen instances. The gains highlight how task design can allow existing large language models to go beyond their typical "one-shot" capabilities and do more systematic reasoning, without architectural changes.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary:

The paper proposes a method to enable Transformer models to perform complex multi-step computations by having them show their work using a "scratchpad". The authors demonstrate that large language models like GPT-3 struggle on tasks requiring unbounded computation such as adding large integers or executing computer programs. They hypothesize this is partly because Transformers are limited to a fixed amount of computation time per input. To address this, they propose allowing models to produce an arbitrary sequence of intermediate computation steps in a "scratchpad" before giving the final output. 

The authors show across a series of tasks that this "scratchpad" approach dramatically improves performance on tasks requiring complex computation. They first show it helps Transformers learn to perform long addition, especially for large out-of-distribution examples. Next they demonstrate scratchpads help with polynomial evaluation in both few-shot and fine-tuning settings. Finally, they show training Transformers to emit full program traces improves execution prediction for Python programs. Overall the work provides strong evidence that the simple addition of a scratchpad allows Transformers to effectively perform complex multi-step computations without architectural changes. The authors suggest this may pave the way for models that truly understand code they generate.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the notion of a "scratchpad" for Transformers to make them better at performing complex discrete computations without modifying the underlying architecture. The main idea is to allow the model to produce an arbitrary sequence of intermediate tokens, called a scratchpad, before producing the final answer. For example, on an addition task, the scratchpad would contain the intermediate steps of a standard algorithm. The intermediate steps are encoded as text and the model is trained using standard supervised techniques to generate them. 

The authors show that this scratchpad approach dramatically improves the ability of language models to perform multi-step computations across a variety of tasks. They first demonstrate improvements on arithmetic tasks like long addition and polynomial evaluation. Then they show that training models to emit program traces improves execution prediction performance on Python programs. Overall, the paper provides evidence that the scratchpad technique allows language models to effectively perform algorithmic reasoning tasks that normally cause them trouble when attempted in one pass. The authors argue the scratchpad provides adaptive computation time, a way to store intermediate state, and forces quantization of states.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces the concept of a "scratchpad" for Transformers to improve their ability to perform complex multi-step computations. The key idea is to train Transformers to emit the intermediate steps of a computation into a buffer or "scratchpad" before producing the final result. 

Specifically, the authors consider tasks like long addition, polynomial evaluation, and predicting the output of executing a Python program. For each task, they create training examples where the target output includes the step-by-step workings (e.g. carrying digits for addition, evaluating terms of a polynomial, tracing execution of a program line-by-line). The Transformer is trained to generate these intermediate steps in a scratchpad before outputting the final result.

This allows the model to adaptively spend computation time on harder problems, iteratively correct its work by attending over previous scratchpad content, and avoid compounding small errors over many steps. It also provides interpretable intermediate outputs that can be analyzed for debugging. Experiments across the tasks show Scratchpad-trained Transformers substantially outperform baseline models that directly predict the output, especially on more complex instances. The authors demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and argue it could extend Transformer reasoning capabilities without architectural changes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using "scratchpads" - sequences of intermediate computation tokens - to help Transformer models perform complex, multi-step computations. Rather than training models to directly map an input to an output, the authors train models to emit step-by-step computations into a scratchpad before producing a final output. As examples, they show how this approach can help models learn to perform long addition, polynomial evaluation, and execution of Python programs. For each task, they design the scratchpad format to contain the key intermediate states needed to perform the computation (e.g. carries, line-by-line program traces). The transformer is then trained in a supervised way to generate the target scratchpad and output. Across the tasks, the scratchpad approach is shown to dramatically improve the model's ability to perform precise, multi-step computations compared to direct input-output mapping.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of large language models struggling with tasks that require unbounded multi-step computation, such as adding integers or executing programs. The authors suggest that this is due to the limitation of these models being forced to perform tasks in one forward pass, without the ability to adapt the amount of compute to the complexity of the task. 

The key question the paper seeks to address is: can we enable large pre-trained language models to perform complex multi-step computations without modifying the underlying model architecture, simply by changing the task formulation?

Specifically, the paper introduces the notion of a "scratchpad" for Transformers to perform step-by-step computations, showing intermediate results. The research aims to investigate whether this approach can dramatically improve the ability of language models to perform tasks requiring algorithmic reasoning and multi-step computation.

So in summary, the paper is tackling the issue of getting large pre-trained language models to better perform complex multi-step computations by allowing them to show their work using a scratchpad. The key research question is whether this simple change in task design can enable existing models to succeed at tasks they previously struggled at.
