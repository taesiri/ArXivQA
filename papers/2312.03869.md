# [Inpaint3D: 3D Scene Content Generation using 2D Inpainting Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating realistic and 3D consistent content to fill arbitrary masked regions in a 3D scene is very challenging. While 2D image inpainting with diffusion models works very well, extending these methods to 3D is difficult due to lack of suitable 3D training data and inconsistencies when inpainting views independently. Prior work has tried using 3D diffusion models directly or conditioning 2D diffusion models on 3D cues like camera poses during optimization, but these approaches have limitations.

Method:
This paper proposes a novel joint optimization framework to reconstruct the unmasked regions of the scene using traditional NeRF losses, while generating new content in the masked regions by distilling an image inpainting diffusion model into the NeRF using score distillation sampling (SDS). The key ideas are:

1) Use a 2D inpainting diffusion model conditioned only on a single masked view without any 3D cues. This allows flexible masking.

2) Jointly optimize NeRF using SDS loss on masked regions to sample the diffusion model and reconstruction loss on unmasked regions. This ties generated content to scene.

3) Use predicted NeRF depth as additional supervision in masked regions for better 3D consistency.

The method works for various mask shapes and sizes, enables tasks like object removal, completion and scene expansion.

Results:

- Shows realistic and 3D consistent inpainting results on complex indoor scenes from Realtor10k dataset with variety of mask types including sphere and scribble masks.

- Quantitative evaluation on object removal dataset shows higher SSIM and lower LPIPS than state-of-the-art method SPIn-NeRF, indicating better 3D consistency.

- Comparisons to inpainting images independently before NeRF optimization gives poor consistency across views in masked regions.

Main Contributions:

- Novel formulation for distilling 2D image inpainting diffusion prior into 3D scenes without need for explicit 3D conditioning or multi-view supervision during diffusion model training.

- Demonstrates high quality semantic inpainting in 3D for complex geometries by joint optimization framework tying NeRF scene reconstruction and diffusion model sampling.

- Enables variety of 3D inpainting applications like object removal, completion, scene expansion within a single framework.
