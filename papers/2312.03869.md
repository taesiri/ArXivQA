# [Inpaint3D: 3D Scene Content Generation using 2D Inpainting Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating realistic and 3D consistent content to fill arbitrary masked regions in a 3D scene is very challenging. While 2D image inpainting with diffusion models works very well, extending these methods to 3D is difficult due to lack of suitable 3D training data and inconsistencies when inpainting views independently. Prior work has tried using 3D diffusion models directly or conditioning 2D diffusion models on 3D cues like camera poses during optimization, but these approaches have limitations.

Method:
This paper proposes a novel joint optimization framework to reconstruct the unmasked regions of the scene using traditional NeRF losses, while generating new content in the masked regions by distilling an image inpainting diffusion model into the NeRF using score distillation sampling (SDS). The key ideas are:

1) Use a 2D inpainting diffusion model conditioned only on a single masked view without any 3D cues. This allows flexible masking.

2) Jointly optimize NeRF using SDS loss on masked regions to sample the diffusion model and reconstruction loss on unmasked regions. This ties generated content to scene.

3) Use predicted NeRF depth as additional supervision in masked regions for better 3D consistency.

The method works for various mask shapes and sizes, enables tasks like object removal, completion and scene expansion.

Results:

- Shows realistic and 3D consistent inpainting results on complex indoor scenes from Realtor10k dataset with variety of mask types including sphere and scribble masks.

- Quantitative evaluation on object removal dataset shows higher SSIM and lower LPIPS than state-of-the-art method SPIn-NeRF, indicating better 3D consistency.

- Comparisons to inpainting images independently before NeRF optimization gives poor consistency across views in masked regions.

Main Contributions:

- Novel formulation for distilling 2D image inpainting diffusion prior into 3D scenes without need for explicit 3D conditioning or multi-view supervision during diffusion model training.

- Demonstrates high quality semantic inpainting in 3D for complex geometries by joint optimization framework tying NeRF scene reconstruction and diffusion model sampling.

- Enables variety of 3D inpainting applications like object removal, completion, scene expansion within a single framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a novel approach to consistent 3D scene inpainting that combines score distillation sampling from a 2D image inpainting diffusion model with traditional NeRF reconstruction losses in a joint optimization framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to inpainting 3D regions of a scene, given masked multi-view images, by distilling a 2D diffusion model into a learned 3D scene representation (e.g. a NeRF). Specifically:

- They propose a joint optimization framework that combines score distillation sampling (SDS) losses to leverage a 2D inpainting diffusion model with traditional NeRF 3D reconstruction losses. The diffusion model is conditioned only on a single masked 2D image rather than explicit 3D cues.

- This allows them to flexibly define an SDS loss to encourage synthesized content resembling the diffusion model samples to fill the masked 3D region, while unmasked regions are reconstructed using standard NeRF losses.

- They demonstrate their approach on various inpainting and outpainting tasks with different mask types, showing it can generate semantically and geometrically consistent 3D content. The approach works well without needing to train a custom 3D-aware diffusion model.

- They compare to recent methods that inpaint 2D views independently before 3D fusion, showing their joint optimization strategy better ensures 3D consistency in the inpainted regions.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposed joint training framework to leverage 2D diffusion models for consistent 3D scene completion, without relying on diffusion models conditioned on multi-view or other explicit 3D data.

The paper presents a novel approach to inpaint 3D regions of a scene given masked multi-view images. It does this by distilling a 2D diffusion model into a learned 3D scene representation (e.g. a NeRF) using score distillation sampling and joint optimization with reconstruction losses. The key ideas involve leveraging a pre-trained 2D inpainting diffusion model to provide strong image priors for generating content in masked 3D regions, while unmasked regions are reconstructed using traditional NeRF losses. Experiments show semantic and geometrically consistent inpainting results for tasks like object removal, completion and replacement.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that explicitly conditioning the diffusion model on 3D cues like multi-view data or camera pose information can be critical to obtaining high quality results. However, their approach uses a diffusion model conditioned only on a single masked 2D image. Why does conditioning on only a masked 2D image work well in their framework compared to prior work? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper argues that their approach moves beyond existing formulations that rely on robust losses or confidence metrics to reconcile inpainting differences across views. What specifically allows their joint optimization framework to achieve better 3D consistency compared to these other methods?

3. Score distillation sampling relies on sampling the diffusion model's conditional probability distribution to guide optimization. The paper notes randomness from this sampling often results in lack of high frequency detail. What modifications could be made to the sampling procedure or optimization process to increase sensitivity to different random seeds? 

4. How does the choice of 2D inpainting diffusion model architecture and training dataset impact what kinds of 3D scenes and objects the overall method can plausibly inpaint? What factors determine success or failure cases?

5. The method uses predicted depth as additional supervision. How does this depth prediction loss term specifically improve results over not using it? What other implicit or explicit 3D geometric priors could further refine quality?

6. What tradeoffs are being made in formulating the problem as masked 2D inpainting during optimization rather than directly operating on an explicit 3D voxel representation? How might performance differ if inpainting 3D voxels instead?

7. How does the method compare if the number of input views is reduced to a sparse set? Would results degrade more gracefully compared to other 3D inpainting methods?

8. The paper demonstrates the approach on mostly indoor scenes. How would the method handle more complex outdoor environments with less repetition and structure compared to indoor layouts?

9. How does runtime scale compared to the different baseline methods? What is the computational bottleneck of the proposed approach that determines how quickly it can generate results?

10. The method distills a 2D model to 3D but does not fine-tune or update the diffusion model itself. How could the 2D and 3D models be jointly optimized or recursively adapted to further improve results?
