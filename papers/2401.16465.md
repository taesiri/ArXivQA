## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "DressCode: Autoregressively Sewing and Generating Garments from Text Guidance":

Problem:
- Garment digitalization is important for digital human creation, but generating customized 3D garments from natural language is still challenging. 
- Existing methods for garment generation lack user-friendliness, focus more on mesh and implicit representations, and overlook structured texture mapping. This limits their compatibility with computer graphics pipelines.

Method:
- Propose DressCode, a text-driven 3D garment generation framework that produces sewing patterns and physically-based rendering (PBR) textures.
- Introduce SewingGPT, a GPT-based model that generates token sequences representing sewing patterns in an autoregressive manner conditioned on text prompts.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model for high-quality tiled PBR texture generation guided by text.
- Allow natural language interaction via a conversational agent to produce shape and texture prompts.

Main Contributions:
- First pipeline to generate 3D garments with sewing patterns and PBR textures from natural language.
- SewingGPT - a novel GPT-based generative model for sewing patterns represented as token sequences.
- Tailored diffusion model for text-conditional PBR texture generation.  
- Applications like pattern completion, texture editing, and multi-garment draping.
- Evaluations show higher quality and better text alignment than state-of-the-art methods. User studies validate rendering quality and practical utility.

In summary, DressCode introduces a customized 3D garment generation pipeline through natural language interaction, with a focus on ensuring compatibility with computer graphics workflows for animation and high-quality rendering. The sewing pattern and PBR texture generation models produce high-quality results aligned with text guidance.
