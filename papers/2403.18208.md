# [An Evolutionary Network Architecture Search Framework with Adaptive   Multimodal Fusion for Hand Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18208)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Hand gesture recognition (HGR) using multimodal data like surface electromyography (sEMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals has shown promising results. However, designing effective multimodal fusion schemes requires extensive expert knowledge and manual trials. 

- Existing works do not consider the optimal fusion positions and ratios between different modalities. Finding the right fusion strategy is critical for accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an Evolutionary Network Architecture Search framework with Adaptive Multimodal Fusion (AMF-ENAS) to automatically find effective fusion schemes. 

- It searches for optimal fusion positions and ratios between sEMG, ACC and sEMG-ACC modalities through an evolutionary algorithm.

- An encoding strategy is designed to represent fusion points, ratios and block selections in neural architecture. Architectures are decoded and evaluated.

- The search migrates the population to specialize on each sub-dataset. The optimal network is then trained and tested.

Main Contributions:
- First application of Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for multimodal HGR to find optimal fusion schemes.

- A novel encoding strategy to simultaneously optimize fusion positions and ratios between multimodal streams.

- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on 3 NinaPro datasets by automatically finding effective fusion schemes for each dataset.

- Reduces need for expert knowledge and manual searches otherwise required to design multimodal fusion schemes.

In summary, the paper proposes an automated search strategy through evolutionary algorithms to find optimal multimodal fusion schemes for HGR tasks. This removes the manual effort otherwise needed to design such schemes. State-of-the-art results on multiple HGR datasets highlight the promise of this approach.
