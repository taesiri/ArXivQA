# [AdaptSFL: Adaptive Split Federated Learning in Resource-constrained Edge   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13101)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training complex deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging. Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across devices without sharing raw data, but still has high computing requirements for on-device training.
- Split learning (SL) partitions the model across devices and server to offload compute, but lacks training efficiency of FL.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "AdaptSFL", an adaptive split federated learning framework to minimize training latency under resource constraints.
- It combines the parallel training of FL with the model splitting of SL. The key ideas are:
   1) Adaptive client-side model aggregation (MA): Aggregating client models periodically (rather than every round) to tradeoff communication vs accuracy.
   2) Adaptive model splitting (MS): Finding optimal split points to balance communication, computing and convergence.

- The paper provides a convergence analysis quantifying the impact of the above adaptations on accuracy. 

- It then formulates and solves an optimization problem to find the best MA frequency and MS strategy to minimize training time to reach target accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First convergence analysis of Split Federated Learning (SFL) characterizing the impact of client-side MA and MS
- Formulation and efficient solution for joint optimization of MA and MS to expedite SFL training 
- Extensive experiments validating faster convergence of AdaptSFL over benchmarks

Overall, the paper makes SFL viable for resource-constrained edge devices by developing adaptive MA and MS techniques with convergence guarantees. The optimization framework can adapt SFL to different edge computing environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes AdaptSFL, a novel resource-adaptive split federated learning framework that features convergence analysis and joint optimization of client-side model aggregation and model splitting to minimize training latency over resource-constrained edge networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a split federated learning (SFL) framework called AdaptSFL to minimize the training latency over resource-constrained edge networks. Specifically, AdaptSFL features adaptive client-side model aggregation and model splitting strategies.

2) It provides the first convergence analysis of SFL that quantifies the impact of client-side model aggregation and model splitting on the learning performance. This serves as a theoretical foundation for optimizing these two strategies in AdaptSFL. 

3) It formulates a joint optimization problem for client-side model aggregation frequency and model splitting to minimize the time consumed for model convergence. This problem is decomposed and efficient algorithms are developed to obtain good solutions.

4) Extensive simulations validate the convergence analysis and demonstrate that AdaptSFL takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy compared to benchmarks without optimization. This highlights the efficacy of the proposed adaptive strategies.

In summary, the key innovation lies in the resource-adaptive and convergence-guaranteed SFL framework along with the quantitative convergence analysis and optimization solutions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Split federated learning (SFL): A distributed machine learning framework that combines aspects of split learning (model partitioning between devices and server) and federated learning (periodic model aggregation).

- Client-side model aggregation (MA): The periodic aggregation of client-side sub-models on the federated server to synchronize models. A key parameter to optimize in SFL.

- Model splitting (MS): The partitioning of the global model into client-side and server-side sub-models. Another key parameter to optimize in SFL. 

- Convergence analysis: The paper provides theoretical convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of client-side MA and MS on SFL performance. This serves as a basis for system optimization.

- Adaptive SFL (AdaptSFL): The proposed resource-adaptive SFL framework that features optimization of client-side MA and MS to minimize training latency under resource constraints.

- Communication-computing tradeoffs: Optimizing client-side MA and MS requires analyzing tradeoffs between communication overhead and convergence rate. The paper formulates and solves this joint optimization problem.

- Edge computing/networks: The paper focuses on optimization and acceleration of SFL under resource-constrained edge computing networks with mobile devices.

In summary, the key focus is on optimizing client-side aggregation frequency and model splitting in split federated learning to improve convergence speed and reduce training latency across resource-constrained edge devices.
