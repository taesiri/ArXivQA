# [Non-Neighbors Also Matter to Kriging: A New Contrastive-Prototypical   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12681)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Kriging is a spatial interpolation method that estimates attributes at unobserved locations from observations at nearby locations. Existing Kriging methods rely solely on the neighbors' information to estimate the target, ignoring potentially useful information from non-neighbors. However, some neighbors can be misleading while some non-neighbors can provide constructive information. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning framework called "Contrastive-Prototypical Learning for Kriging (KCP)" that utilizes information from both neighbors and non-neighbors to estimate the target node. The key ideas are:

1) Neighboring Contrast Module: Attracts neighbors' representations together and repels non-neighbors' representations apart to conform to the common practice of using neighbors in Kriging. 

2) Prototypical Module: Identifies similar representations via exchanged prediction to refine misleading neighbors and recycle useful non-neighbors from the contrast module. As a result, not all neighbors and some non-neighbors will be used.

3) Adaptive Augmentation Module: Generates diverse and Kriging-related augmented data via probabilistic attribute and topology augmentations to facilitate robust representation learning.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes the first Kriging solution to break the "neighbors only" assumption by aggregating information from not all neighbors and some non-neighbors.

2) Designs collaborating self-supervised modules to refine and recycle constructive information and an adaptive augmentation module for robust representation learning tailored to Kriging. 

3) Extensive experiments show superior performance over baselines by 3-6% and exceptional transferability and robustness to noise.

In summary, this paper provides a new perspective and solution for Kriging by judiciously utilizing information from both neighbors and non-neighbors via self-supervised representation learning. The proposed ideas and framework significantly advance the state-of-the-art in Kriging.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework called "Contrastive-Prototypical Learning for Kriging" that improves spatial interpolation by learning to refine misleading neighbors and recycle useful non-neighbors when estimating unobserved locations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

(1) The authors propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for spatiotemporal Kriging that breaks the common practice of only using neighbor information. Instead, the framework utilizes information from both some of the neighbors and some of the non-neighbors to estimate unobserved nodes.

(2) The framework contains two collaborating self-supervised learning modules - a neighboring contrast module and a prototypical module. The neighboring contrast module attracts neighbors together and repels non-neighbors, while the prototypical module refines misleading neighbors and recycles useful non-neighbors from the neighboring contrast module.

(3) An adaptive augmentation module is proposed to generate diverse and task-related augmented data to facilitate robust representation learning for the self-supervised modules.

(4) Extensive experiments show superior performance of the proposed model over state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. The model achieves 3-6% lower error and also demonstrates better transferability and robustness.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel self-supervised learning framework for Kriging that breaks the "neighbors only" assumption and leverages information from both neighbors and useful non-neighbors in a collaborative manner.

- Neighboring contrast - SSL component that attracts neighbor node representations together while pushing non-neighbor representations apart.

- Prototypical head - SSL component that identifies similar representations for target nodes regardless of adjacency, refining neighbors and recycling non-neighbors from contrast.  

- Adaptive augmentation - Component that generates augmented views of data in attribute and topology domains to encourage representation diversity.

- Inductive kriging - Ability to estimate unseen/unobserved nodes not available during training stage.

- Contrastive-Prototypical learning - Overall proposed SSL approach combining neighboring contract with prototypical prediction to select informative nodes for target estimation.
