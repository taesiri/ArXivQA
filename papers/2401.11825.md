## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Sparse identification of differential equations from noisy observed data is important but faces two key challenges: (1) noise sensitivity, especially for derivative approximations, and (2) high computational cost for high-fidelity (HF) data. 

Proposed Solutions:
1. Gaussian Process-based SINDy (GP-SINDy)
- Uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) as a global surrogate model to smooth noisy single-fidelity (SF) data and analytically calculate derivatives. 
- Uncertainty quantification from GPR is incorporated into a weighted least squares problem for sparse identification.
- Enables accurate recovery of equations even from sparse, noisy SF data.

2. Multi-Fidelity GP-SINDy (MFGP-SINDy)  
- Leverages multi-fidelity Gaussian processes to effectively fuse information from multiple fidelity levels. 
- Allows using a small amount of costly HF data together with more abundant low-fidelity (LF) data.
- Provides explicit analytical formulas for derivatives of the multi-fidelity kernel.
- Achieves improved accuracy and lower computational cost compared to only HF or LF data.

Main Contributions:
- Novel GPR-based approach (GP-SINDy) for robust sparse identification from noisy SF data
- New multi-fidelity framework (MFGP-SINDy) to incorporate LF and HF data for efficiency
- Analytical derivatives of multi-fidelity GP kernel for sparse identification
- Demonstrated accuracy and noise robustness on numerical experiments including Lorenz system, Burgers' equation etc.

The key innovation is using Gaussian processes for smoothing and analytical derivatives to address noise sensitivity and exploit multi-fidelity modeling for efficiency. The proposed GP-SINDy and MFGP-SINDy methods advance the state-of-the-art in data-driven discovery of differential equations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two robust methods, GP-SINDy and MFGP-SINDy, to discover differential equations from noisy single-fidelity and multi-fidelity data respectively by leveraging Gaussian process regression and its uncertainty quantification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a robust algorithm called GP-SINDy that utilizes Gaussian process regression (GPR) to construct a global surrogate model for smoothing noisy data and analytically computing derivatives. It also incorporates the uncertainty quantification from GPR into the weighted least squares problem for sparse identification of differential equations from single-fidelity noisy data.

2. It develops an algorithm called MFGP-SINDy that leverages multi-fidelity Gaussian processes to effectively fuse information from multi-fidelity training data with different levels of fidelity and cost. This allows using a smaller amount of high-fidelity data combined with more low-fidelity data to reduce overall computational cost while still obtaining accurate discovery results.

3. It provides detailed derivations for computing the partial derivatives of the multi-fidelity Gaussian process kernel function. This analytical differentiation is important for handling derivatives in the sparse identification problem when using multi-fidelity surrogate modeling.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing two robust methods GP-SINDy and MFGP-SINDy for sparse identification of differential equations that can handle noise and uncertainty in both single-fidelity and multi-fidelity data scenarios.
