# [Provable Risk-Sensitive Distributional Reinforcement Learning with   General Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18159)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) with static Lipschitz risk measures (LRM), which is crucial for decision making under uncertainty in safety-critical applications. 
- Challenges: Optimizing static LRM is complex as it involves the entire cumulative reward distribution. Also, the optimal policy is non-Markovian. Prior works are limited to tabular MDPs or specific risk measures. No sample-efficient algorithms exist for RSRL with general function approximation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a general framework for RSRL with static LRM and general function approximation. Two settings are considered - model-based and general value function approximation.

- For model-based, a meta algorithm RS-DisRL-M is introduced. Novel model estimation methods based on least squares regression (LSR) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are developed using distributional analysis in augmented MDPs.

- For general value function approximation, a meta algorithm RS-DisRL-V is proposed. Innovative LSR and MLE techniques are extended to estimate distributions and construct version spaces. 

Main Contributions:  
- First framework covering broad class of RSRL with static LRM and function approximation

- Pioneering analysis of LSR and MLE in distributional RL with augmented MDPs   

- Meta algorithms RS-DisRL-M and RS-DisRL-V with sublinear regret bounds, establishing first statistically efficient algorithms for RSRL with general function approximation

- Concrete bound with âˆšK dependency obtained for both approaches, marking minimax optimality even in tabular cases

- Sample efficiency and wider applicability over prior RSRL approaches

In summary, the paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions in designing statistically and computationally efficient algorithms for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning in complex environments.
