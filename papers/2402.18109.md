## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Dual-Context Aggregation for Universal Image Matting":

Problem: 
Existing image matting methods are designed for specific objects or guidance types (e.g. trimaps, clicks), and their performance deteriorates when applied to other objects or guidance. This limits their effectiveness in unforeseen scenarios. The key challenges are accurately identifying foreground contours and boundaries to generate precise alpha mattes. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a simple and universal image matting framework called Dual-Context Aggregation Matting (DCAM) that enables robust matting with arbitrary guidance or no guidance. 

Key ideas:
1) A semantic backbone network extracts low-level and context features from the input image and guidance. 
2) A dual-context aggregation network refines the context features using global object aggregators and local appearance aggregators in a cascaded structure. This performs both global contour segmentation and local boundary refinement.
3) A matting decoder fuses the low-level and refined context features to estimate the alpha matte.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes a universal image matting framework DCAM that works with diverse guidance types and objects.
2) Introduces a dual-context aggregation network to iteratively refine context features using global and local aggregators, improving robustness. 
3) Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 matting datasets, outperforming existing methods in both automatic and interactive matting tasks. This demonstrates DCAM's strong universality and high performance.

In summary, the key innovation is the dual-context aggregation design that aggregates both global contours and local boundaries to achieve a universal matting framework that generalizes across objects, guidance types, and tasks. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.
