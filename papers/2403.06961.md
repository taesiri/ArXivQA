# [Explainable Transformer Prototypes for Medical Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deployments of AI in medical diagnostics require not just accuracy but also explainability and trust in machine decisions. 
- Recent trends use Transformer models for medical image classification due to their impressive capabilities. However, their complex attention mechanisms may not effectively pinpoint regions directly influencing AI decisions.
- Existing methods like Grad-CAM produce ad-hoc explanations that can be unstable and sensitive to input changes. Altering model architecture for interpretability can lead to performance drops.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new prototype learning algorithm with an interpretable self-attention mechanism integrated into the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) architecture. 
- It features an innovative region-to-region self-attention that replaces the traditional grid-based patch splitting with parametric prototype representation learning to provide better visual explanations.
- The module predicts masks to highlight important regions. Masked features are used to generate query vectors. Attention values are calculated between queries and prototype key vectors. Prototype value vectors are then reconstructed using the weighted masks to obtain the output features.

Main Contributions:
- Novel interpretable self-attention mechanism within a prototype learning paradigm that offers region-to-region attention instead of pixel-to-pixel attention.
- Rigorous evaluation on NIH Chest X-Ray dataset demonstrates effectiveness for explainability and on-par/better performance than state-of-the-art methods.
- Self-attention mechanism produces visual explanations at multiple feature layers for different resolutions, enhancing interpretability.
- Provides a promising direction for developing more trustable AI systems to facilitate adoption of such technologies into clinical practice.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel interpretable self-attention mechanism for vision transformers that replaces traditional patch-based attention with a region-to-region attention scheme using parametric prototypes, providing visually explainable masks that identify important regions in medical images for diagnosis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is an innovative interpretable self-attention mechanism within a prototype learning paradigm with vision transformers. Specifically:

1) They propose a novel interpretable self-attention layer that replaces the traditional grid-based patch splitting operation used in transformers with parametric prototype representation learning. This provides significantly better visual explanations.

2) The self-attention uses additional masking branches and global average pooling to derive "query" vectors that are region-based rather than pixel-based. The key and value vectors are prototype vectors that are learned rather than conditioned on the input. 

3) This allows for a region-to-region self-attention that finds similarities between input regions rather than pixels. The masks highlight important regions and are used to select the value vectors to form the output features.

4) The interpretable self-attention layers are embedded within the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) architecture to leverage convolutional features while maintaining smaller model size.

In summary, the main contribution is an interpretable region-to-region transformer self-attention mechanism for improved explainability and prototype-based representation learning.
