# [Pathways: Asynchronous Distributed Dataflow for ML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12533)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can we design a distributed ML system that matches the performance of current multi-controller systems like JAX for existing ML workloads, while also providing more flexibility to support emerging ML techniques? 

The key ideas and contributions in addressing this question are:

- Proposing a single-controller system architecture with centralized resource management and scheduling. This provides flexibility for features like multi-tenancy and virtualization compared to multi-controller systems.

- Using a sharded asynchronous dataflow execution model to efficiently coordinate computations across thousands of accelerators. This allows expressing more complex computation patterns beyond pure SPMD.

- Introducing asynchronous dispatch techniques like parallel dispatch to match the performance of multi-controller systems despite the overheads of a single-controller design.

- Demonstrating these capabilities by implementing the system Pathways and showing performance on par with JAX for existing models, while also enabling efficient pipelining and multi-tenancy.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that with careful systems design and engineering, it is possible to get the best of both worlds - retaining performance for current ML workloads while unlocking capabilities needed for emerging techniques. The Pathways system aims to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Pathways, a new distributed machine learning system designed to support flexible and heterogeneous computations across thousands of accelerators. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Pathways adopts a single-controller architecture with a centralized resource manager and scheduler. This provides flexibility for non-SPMD computations and enables features like multi-tenancy and virtualization. 

- It uses a sharded asynchronous dataflow execution model to achieve performance comparable to multi-controller systems like JAX for large-scale SPMD computations.

- The asynchronous dataflow allows parallel dispatch of regular compiled functions to mask coordination overheads. Gang scheduling ensures consistent ordering across accelerators.

- Pathways introduces a novel parallel asynchronous dispatch mechanism to pipeline execution across accelerators connected over network.

- Evaluations demonstrate Pathways matches JAX's performance on large Transformer models with thousands of cores, and efficiently executes models pipelined across accelerators or partitioned into islands with coordination over low-bandwidth links.

In summary, Pathways combines the flexibility of centralized control with performance rivaling decentralized designs, aiming to support more complex and heterogeneous ML workloads compared to current systems. The novel asynchronous dataflow execution model is key to achieving this combination.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents Pathways, a new large-scale distributed training system that combines the performance of multi-controller frameworks like JAX with the flexibility of single-controller frameworks like TensorFlow, enabling efficient execution of non-SPMD machine learning programs across thousands of accelerators while retaining high performance on existing SPMD workloads.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents Pathways, a new large-scale orchestration system for machine learning workloads on accelerators like TPUs. Here are some key ways it compares to prior research:

- It adopts a single-controller architecture, rather than the multi-controller design used in systems like PyTorch and JAX. This provides more flexibility for non-SPMD computations, resource management, and virtualization. But the paper shows Pathways can match multi-controller performance by using techniques like asynchronous dispatch and centralized gang scheduling.

- Compared to previous single-controller systems like TensorFlow, Pathways is designed to scale to thousands of accelerators. It uses a sharded dataflow execution model rather than materializing a full computation graph. And it supports features like gang scheduling that were missing in TensorFlow.

- The paper demonstrates performance on par with JAX for distributed training of models like Transformer. It also shows how Pathways can efficiently execute pipelines and models distributed across multiple accelerator "islands" connected over datacenter network.

- Pathways aims to support more advanced workloads anticipated in the future, like models with finer-grain sparsity and heterogeneity. The single-controller design and resource management should enable research into techniques like multi-tenancy, virtualization, and sharing of foundation models.

- Overall, Pathways distinguishes itself by combining strengths of both multi-controller and single-controller systems. It matches current performance while providing more flexibility for future systems and ML research directions. The results validate its asynchronous dispatch, gang scheduling, and other mechanisms as an efficient basis for exploration.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Resource management: The paper mentions exploring more sophisticated resource management and scheduling algorithms in Pathways beyond their simple heuristic approach. This includes dynamic allocation algorithms that take into account resource requirements of all running jobs and current system state. They also mention supporting multi-tenant requirements like priorities, performance isolation, access control, and accounting at faster timescales and larger scale.

- Data-dependent vectorized control flow: The authors discuss supporting new forms of vectorized control flow where different model weights can be updated per example or sub-example in a batch. This would allow exploiting computational sparsity more effectively in large models. They mention JAX's transforms for vectorizing per-example functions as a good basis for this.

- Pipelining optimizations: The paper demonstrates efficient pipelined execution but suggests further optimizations may be possible, for example reordering computations based on estimated execution times.

- New parallelism patterns: The flexible programming model of Pathways is designed to enable exploration of novel parallelism patterns beyond current SPMD models. Examples mentioned include graph neural networks, neural architecture search, multi-modal multi-task learning.

- Shared foundation models: The authors suggest Pathways could enable efficiently training and serving large foundation models that are shared across many tasks, by exploiting techniques like sharing sub-models, concurrent fine-tuning, and combining examples from different tasks.

In summary, the main future directions are around supporting more flexible computational patterns and parallelism beyond SPMD, advanced resource management and scheduling policies, and optimizations like pipelining and shared foundation models. The overall goal is to enable efficient training and serving of emerging ML models on large-scale accelerator clusters.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Pathways, a new large-scale orchestration layer for machine learning accelerators. Pathways uses an asynchronous distributed dataflow model to efficiently coordinate computations across thousands of accelerators. It represents programs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where each node is a compiled function that runs on a subset of accelerators. Edges between nodes represent data dependencies. Pathways dynamically manages accelerator resources and gang schedules computations across devices while handling data transfers over dedicated interconnects. It adopts a single-controller design to more easily express complex parallelism patterns beyond standard SPMD, while using techniques like sharded dataflow and asynchronous dispatch to match the performance of multi-controller systems on SPMD workloads. Evaluations demonstrate Pathways achieves similar performance to state-of-the-art systems like JAX for conventional models, while better supporting emerging techniques like model parallelism, pipelining, and computational sparsity across heterogeneous hardware.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Pathways, a new large scale orchestration layer for machine learning accelerators. Pathways uses a sharded dataflow graph of asynchronous operators that consume and produce futures, and efficiently gang-schedules heterogeneous parallel computations on thousands of accelerators while coordinating data transfers over dedicated interconnects. The key capabilities of Pathways include:

1) An asynchronous distributed dataflow design that allows the control plane to execute in parallel despite dependencies in the data plane. This single-controller design makes it easier to express complex parallelism patterns compared to multi-controller systems. 

2) Careful system design and engineering to match the performance of state-of-the-art multi-controller systems that directly execute SPMD computations over accelerators. Pathways achieves comparable performance to multi-controller systems for realistic workloads spanning thousands of accelerators.

3) Mechanisms like centralized scheduling and virtualization that are suited to support computational sparsity, heterogeneity, sharing and elasticity for future ML workloads. The evaluation validates these capabilities through experiments on multi-tenant workload scheduling, and distributed training over pipelines and accelerator islands.

In summary, Pathways combines the flexibility of single-controller systems with the performance of multi-controllers, providing both the capabilities needed for future ML workloads and performance parity with state-of-the-art systems for today's models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents Pathways, a new distributed machine learning system designed to support flexible and heterogeneous computations across thousands of accelerators. Pathways uses a "sharded" asynchronous dataflow model to represent programs as directed acyclic graphs of operators that consume and produce futures. It coordinates the distributed execution of these dataflow graphs using asynchronous dispatch of computations to gangs of accelerators, allowing parallel execution of host-side operations. Pathways adopts a single-controller design with centralized resource management and scheduling to achieve high performance while enabling features like multi-tenancy and virtualization. The system is evaluated on real ML workloads at scale, demonstrating performance comparable to multi-controller systems for SPMD computations and the ability to efficiently execute pipelined and sharded models across islands of accelerators. The asynchronous dataflow execution model allows Pathways to match the performance of multi-controller systems while providing more flexibility in expressing complex computations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a new system called Pathways for distributed machine learning. The key problems and questions it is trying to address are:

- Current ML systems are over-specialized for SPMD workloads and cannot efficiently support emerging workloads like pipelining and sparsity. Pathways aims to support these new workloads while matching performance of SPMD.

- Multi-controller systems like PyTorch and JAX make it hard to do centralized resource management and virtualization. Pathways adopts a single-controller design to enable these capabilities.

- Existing single-controller systems like TensorFlow have high overhead for dispatch and gang scheduling when scaling to thousands of accelerators. Pathways introduces techniques to reduce this overhead.

- Supporting efficient irregular communication patterns and sparsity requires a scalable runtime. Pathways uses a sharded dataflow runtime to compactly represent computations on thousands of shards.

In summary, Pathways is trying to create a flexible system that can support current and emerging ML workloads at scale, while enabling advanced resource management capabilities that are difficult in multi-controller designs. The key innovations are around asynchronous dispatch, gang scheduling, sharding, and adopting a single-controller model to match multi-controller performance.
