# [Probabilistic Planning with Partially Ordered Preferences over Temporal   Goals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of preference-based planning in stochastic systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Prior works assume that the user preferences form a total order, meaning all outcomes are comparable. This paper considers partial order preferences where some outcomes may be incomparable. The problem is to compute a policy that is "preferred" respecting the partial order preferences over temporal goals.

Proposed Solution:
1) Introduce a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA) to model user's possibly partial preferences over temporally extended goals. 
2) Identify connection between the probabilistic planning problem and stochastic orders to rank policies using the notion of "weak-stochastic nondominated" policies.
3) Reduce the problem to finding weak-stochastic nondominated policies in a Multi-Objective MDP (MOMDP) constructed from the product of original MDP and PDFA. 
4) Show Pareto optimal policies in the MOMDP correspond to weak-stochastic nondominated policies in original MDP respecting preferences. Thus existing methods can find these policies.

Main Contributions:
1) A PDFA model to specify possibly partial order preferences over temporal goals
2) Establishing relationship between probabilistic planning under partial order preferences and the concept of weak-stochastic nondominated policies
3) Reduction to a MOMDP problem by constructing product MDP and PDFA  
4) An algorithm to find preferred policies by computing Pareto optimal policies in the product MOMDP

The key insight is to use stochastic orders to handle possibly incomparable outcomes and reduction to multi-objective planning. Case studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies probabilistic planning with partially ordered preferences over temporal goals in stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a new computational model called a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA) to model a user's (possibly partial) preferences over temporally extended goals.

2) It identifies the connection between the probabilistic preference-based planning problem and stochastic orders, which allows reducing the problem to finding the set of weak-stochastic nondominated policies in a product of an MDP and the PDFA. 

3) It employs the property of weak-stochastic nondominated policies to design multiple objectives in the product MDP and proves that a Pareto-optimal policy in the resulting multi-objective product MDP is weak-stochastic nondominated respecting the preference relation. This allows using off-the-shelf solvers to compute the set of weak-stochastic nondominated policies in polynomial time.

So in summary, the key contribution is providing a framework and algorithms for preference-based planning in stochastic systems with possibly partial preference relations over temporal goals. The framework leverages concepts like PDFAs, stochastic orders, multi-objective MDPs, and Pareto optimality.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Probabilistic planning - The paper studies planning in stochastic/probabilistic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs).

- Temporal goals - It considers preferences over temporally extended goals rather than individual states.

- Partial order preferences - It deals with user preferences that form a partial order over outcomes rather than a total order, allowing for incomparable outcomes.  

- Preference DFA - It introduces a preference deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to model user's possibly partial preferences over temporal goals.

- Weak stochastic ordering - It uses the concept of weak stochastic ordering to compare probability distributions induced by policies over outcomes based on the preference partial order.

- Weak stochastic nondominated policies - The goal is to synthesize policies that are nondominated with respect to the weak stochastic ordering.

- Multi-objective MDP - It reduces the problem to finding Pareto optimal policies in a constructed multi-objective MDP.

In summary, key ideas involve probabilistic planning, temporal goals, partial order user preferences, preference DFAs, stochastic dominance relations, and multi-objective MDPs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces a new model called Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA). How does a PDFA differ from a regular DFA? What additional components does it have and what role do they play in specifying user preferences?

2) The paper relates the PBP problem to stochastic orders and the notion of weak-stochastic nondomination. Explain this connection. Why is using stochastic orders useful for comparing policies in a stochastic system with respect to partial order preferences? 

3) Explain how the construction of the product MDP in Definition 5 captures the preferences specified in the PDFA within the MDP framework. In particular, describe how the preference graph is lifted to the set of goal states. 

4) Theorem 1 shows the connection between Pareto optimal policies in the multi-objective MDP and weak-stochastic nondominated policies in the original MDP. Walk through the details of this proof. What are the key insights that establish this equivalence?

5) The case study considers two variants of the garden example - one with deterministic robot dynamics and one with stochastic dynamics. Compare the policies obtained in these two cases for the same preference weights. Why are they different? What role does stochasticity play?

6) The constructed multi-objective MDP has overlapping goal sets $Z_i$. What is the implication of this? How does it relate to the possibility of incomparable outcomes in the preference specification?

7) The results show that even with high weight on the top preferred outcome, its probability of satisfaction is low. Provide an explanation of why this occurs, based on the problem description.  

8) Discuss the computational complexity of the overall approach - constructing the product MDP and solving the multi-objective MDP. What are the bottlenecks? How can it be scaled to larger problems?

9) The current approach focuses on improper policies and finite traces. Discuss how you could extend it to recurrent specifications over infinite paths. What changes would be required?

10) The paper uses a hand-designed PDFA to specify preferences. Discuss possible ways to derive such a preference model automatically from language-based specifications or human feedback.
