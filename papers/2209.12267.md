# [Probabilistic Planning with Partially Ordered Preferences over Temporal   Goals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of preference-based planning in stochastic systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Prior works assume that the user preferences form a total order, meaning all outcomes are comparable. This paper considers partial order preferences where some outcomes may be incomparable. The problem is to compute a policy that is "preferred" respecting the partial order preferences over temporal goals.

Proposed Solution:
1) Introduce a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA) to model user's possibly partial preferences over temporally extended goals. 
2) Identify connection between the probabilistic planning problem and stochastic orders to rank policies using the notion of "weak-stochastic nondominated" policies.
3) Reduce the problem to finding weak-stochastic nondominated policies in a Multi-Objective MDP (MOMDP) constructed from the product of original MDP and PDFA. 
4) Show Pareto optimal policies in the MOMDP correspond to weak-stochastic nondominated policies in original MDP respecting preferences. Thus existing methods can find these policies.

Main Contributions:
1) A PDFA model to specify possibly partial order preferences over temporal goals
2) Establishing relationship between probabilistic planning under partial order preferences and the concept of weak-stochastic nondominated policies
3) Reduction to a MOMDP problem by constructing product MDP and PDFA  
4) An algorithm to find preferred policies by computing Pareto optimal policies in the product MOMDP

The key insight is to use stochastic orders to handle possibly incomparable outcomes and reduction to multi-objective planning. Case studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.
