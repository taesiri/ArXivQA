# [IR-UWB Radar-Based Contactless Silent Speech Recognition of Vowels,   Consonants, Words, and Phrases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09572)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Silent speech recognition (SSR) aims to convert speech-related biosignals into text. Existing SSR techniques often require invasive sensor attachment. Although radar is a promising technique for contactless SSR, phoneme-level recognition using contactless radar has not been demonstrated. Phoneme recognition is vital to recognize diverse speech composed of many phonemes. However, extracting effective speech features from raw radar signals for phoneme recognition is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a contactless impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar-based SSR system to achieve phoneme-level recognition of vowels, consonants, as well as words and phrases. A novel speech feature extraction algorithm called FERASEC is introduced to effectively capture articulatory movements from raw radar data. FERASEC transforms the radar data into a compact sequence that represents the abbreviated envelope of concatenated frames. This sequence is utilized as a speech feature for classification. FERASEC features are combined with either multi-dimensional dynamic time warping or a deep neural network-hidden Markov model for classification.

Main Contributions:
- First demonstration of contactless radar-based phoneme recognition, including both vowels and consonants
- Proposal of FERASEC algorithm to extract discriminative speech features from IR-UWB radar data  
- Comparison of FERASEC with a baseline radar feature extraction method 
- Investigation into optimal radar positioning in contactless SSR
- Experimental validation and performance benchmarking on phoneme, word and phrase recognition tasks

The proposed methods effectively recognize various speech stimuli, providing compelling evidence of IR-UWB radar's capability for contactless phoneme-level silent speech recognition.
