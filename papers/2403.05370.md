# [On a Software Joint Velocity Limitation of a Spherical Parallel   Manipulator with Coaxial Input Shafts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05370)

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on the content shown, which appears to be a LaTeX source code plotting some mathematical functions, I do not have enough context to determine specific keywords or key terms associated with an overall paper. The plot itself seems to show some singularity loci and a prescribed workspace area. Some guesses at potential keywords based solely on these limited contents could include:

- Mathematical visualization/plotting
- Singularity analysis 
- Workspace modeling
- LaTeX/TikZ graphics

However, there is not enough information or context here for me to reliably deduce keywords for an entire paper. More details on the paper's topic, contents, and context would be needed. The keywords would likely involve specifics about the mathematical concepts, models, or applications being presented.
