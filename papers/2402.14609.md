## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "FedCQA: Answering Complex Queries on Multi-Source Knowledge Graphs via Federated Learning":

Problem:
- Existing complex query answering (CQA) models focus on querying a single central knowledge graph and cannot reason across multiple knowledge graphs. 
- Sharing sensitive raw knowledge graphs to construct an aggregated graph is impractical due to privacy concerns and regulations.
- Thus it remains challenging to answer complex cross-graph queries involving multiple knowledge graphs.

Proposed Solution: 
- Apply federated learning techniques to enable collaborative training of complex query answering models across multiple knowledge graphs without sharing raw graph data.
- Propose FedCQA, a federated learning framework for complex query answering across distributed knowledge graphs.
- In FedCQA, each client trains a local CQA model on its graph. These local models are periodically aggregated at a central server to construct a global model without exposing raw graph data.
- For query answering, complex cross-graph queries are decomposed into sub-queries answerable by local CQA models, with answers aggregated at the central server. Local computation and MPC techniques are used to protect sensitive information.

Main Contributions:
- First work to extend federated learning for privacy-preserving complex query answering across multiple knowledge graphs. 
- Propose techniques like secret aggregation and distributed query retrieval to enable federated training and querying while preserving data privacy.
- Created benchmark datasets based on three public KGs to evaluate federated CQA performance.
- Experiments demonstrate FedCQA can effectively answer cross-graph complex queries by reasoning over distributed KGs with privacy preserved.

In summary, the paper presents a novel federated learning approach to enable complex reasoning over multi-source knowledge graphs while avoiding the need for centralized sharing of sensitive graph data. The proposed FedCQA framework leverages collaborative learning across graphs to answer cross-graph queries without compromising data privacy.
