# [Federated Complex Qeury Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "FedCQA: Answering Complex Queries on Multi-Source Knowledge Graphs via Federated Learning":

Problem:
- Existing complex query answering (CQA) models focus on querying a single central knowledge graph and cannot reason across multiple knowledge graphs. 
- Sharing sensitive raw knowledge graphs to construct an aggregated graph is impractical due to privacy concerns and regulations.
- Thus it remains challenging to answer complex cross-graph queries involving multiple knowledge graphs.

Proposed Solution: 
- Apply federated learning techniques to enable collaborative training of complex query answering models across multiple knowledge graphs without sharing raw graph data.
- Propose FedCQA, a federated learning framework for complex query answering across distributed knowledge graphs.
- In FedCQA, each client trains a local CQA model on its graph. These local models are periodically aggregated at a central server to construct a global model without exposing raw graph data.
- For query answering, complex cross-graph queries are decomposed into sub-queries answerable by local CQA models, with answers aggregated at the central server. Local computation and MPC techniques are used to protect sensitive information.

Main Contributions:
- First work to extend federated learning for privacy-preserving complex query answering across multiple knowledge graphs. 
- Propose techniques like secret aggregation and distributed query retrieval to enable federated training and querying while preserving data privacy.
- Created benchmark datasets based on three public KGs to evaluate federated CQA performance.
- Experiments demonstrate FedCQA can effectively answer cross-graph complex queries by reasoning over distributed KGs with privacy preserved.

In summary, the paper presents a novel federated learning approach to enable complex reasoning over multi-source knowledge graphs while avoiding the need for centralized sharing of sensitive graph data. The proposed FedCQA framework leverages collaborative learning across graphs to answer cross-graph queries without compromising data privacy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated learning framework called FedCQA to enable collaborative complex query answering over distributed knowledge graphs while preserving data privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose FedCQA, a federated complex query answering framework to reason over multi-source knowledge graphs while preserving privacy. To the best of their knowledge, this is the first work to extend federated knowledge graph embedding systems to complex query answering tasks.

2. Based on three public datasets, they create a benchmark for evaluating the retrieval performance of federated complex query answering systems. The benchmark systematically evaluates performance on cross knowledge graph queries. 

3. They conduct extensive experiments on three datasets which demonstrate the high performance of FedCQA in retrieving answers to complex cross-graph queries while keeping sensitive information private.
