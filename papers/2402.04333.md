# [LESS: Selecting Influential Data for Targeted Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04333)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Instruction tuning using large and diverse datasets has made large language models (LLMs) adept at following human instructions in open-domain chatbots. 
- However, real-world applications often require cultivating specific capabilities like reasoning. Using mixed instruction data can hinder developing these capabilities.  
- The paper frames the problem of effectively utilizing instruction data for a target capability as "targeted instruction tuning". The key challenge is identifying the most relevant data from extensive instruction datasets for a capability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes LESS, an algorithm to effectively estimate data influences using gradient information and perform low-rank gradient similarity search to select influential instruction data.
- LESS adapts existing influence formulations to work with the Adam optimizer and variable-length instruction data. 
- It constructs a highly reusable gradient datastore with low-dimensional gradient features via LoRA and random projections. 
- For a target task, LESS selects data similar to the few-shot examples embodying the capability, based on gradient features.

Main Contributions:
- Compatible with Instruction Tuning using Adam optimizer
- Efficient computation and storage of gradient features  
- Transferable data selection from small to large models 
- Selects data matching reasoning requirements, not just surface forms
- Experiments show training on 5% LESS-selected data can outperform full dataset across tasks
- Qualitative analysis reveals LESS circumvents shortcuts and identifies capability-relevant data

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient and effective gradient similarity based method to identify the most relevant instruction data to induce a target capability in language models. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the approach's superiority over baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes LESS, an efficient algorithm to select the most influential data from large instruction tuning datasets for targeted capability development in language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. LESS, an algorithm that adapts influence functions to select the most relevant data from instruction tuning datasets for a target downstream task. The key aspects of LESS include:

- It is compatible with the Adam optimizer commonly used for instruction tuning of large language models.

- It uses low-dimensional gradient features computed efficiently via LoRA and random projections to enable scalable data selection.

- The selected data transfers well across model sizes and families. A small model can be used to select data for a larger model.

2. Experiments showing that training on just 5% of LESS-selected data can match or exceed the performance of training on the full dataset of instruction tuning data.

3. Analysis demonstrating that LESS selects more interpretable data that requires similar reasoning skills to the target task, compared to selection based on surface form features.

4. Potentially interesting optimization insights in adapting influence functions for variable length instruction tuning data and the Adam optimizer.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective and efficient data selection algorithm called LESS that can identify the most relevant subsets of instruction tuning data for targeted downstream tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an influence formulation that is compatible with the Adam optimizer. How does this formulation differ from existing influence formulations for SGD? What challenges did the authors have to address to make the formulation work with Adam?

2. The paper constructs a highly reusable gradient datastore to enable efficient data selection. What techniques do the authors use to make the gradient features low-dimensional and easily manipulable? Why is it important for the features to be low-dimensional?

3. The data selection algorithm in the paper seems to effectively handle variable-length instruction data and avoid short sequence biases. What modifications were made to the standard influence formulation to enable this? How does handling variable-length sequences in this context differ from other domains like vision?

4. The paper demonstrates that data selected by smaller models can effectively improve performance when used to train larger models. Why does this transferability occur? What assumptions about model gradients are required for this to work? 

5. The qualitative analysis reveals that the selected data often focuses more on the type of reasoning required rather than surface form features. What examples support this conclusion? Why might this be a useful trait for targeted instruction tuning scenarios?

6. The paper frames targeted instruction tuning as an important use case. What are some real-world applications where only a small subset of skills are needed from a general instruction tuning dataset? What challenges arise in this setting?

7. The efficiency analysis shows that gradient feature computation carries the bulk of the computational cost. What techniques could be used to further improve efficiency of gradient computations for large language models? Are there ways to update features incrementally?

8. How effective was the data selection approach for different base model capacities? Were there differences in how well the approach worked for smaller vs. larger models? What might explain potential differences?

9. The analysis revealed cases where minimizing loss does not improve accuracy, an issue also seen in other works. What objectives could we optimize instead that might better correlate with task accuracy? How might they interact with the data selection formulation?

10. The paper computes sequence-level gradients by averaging token-level gradients. What anomalies were caused by this and how were they addressed? Could computing influences at the token-level instead lead to further improvements? What barriers exist to make that infeasible currently?
