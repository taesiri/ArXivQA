# [Tailor: Size Recommendations for High-End Fashion Marketplaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
In online high-end fashion marketplaces, providing accurate and personalized size recommendations is critical for ensuring customer satisfaction and retention. However, this is challenging due to factors like limited size availability, complicated return processes, large number of products/brands, and sparsity of user-product interactions. The goal is to develop an approach for size recommendation that is customized for high-end fashion.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose "Tailor", a novel sequence classification approach that integrates implicit (Add2Bag interactions) and explicit (ReturnReason feedback) user signals. It comprises two models:

1. SSP-LSTM: Encodes user signals via LSTMs into a user "History Embedding", encodes product info into a "Product Embedding", and combines them to make a size prediction.

2. SSP-Attention: Encodes user history via a transformer attention block, attends to relevant events based on product info, and predicts a size.

By modeling users as event sequences, the models can generalize to new users at test time.

Main Contributions:

1. Evaluation of existing size recommendation baselines on a complex high-end fashion dataset, and findings regarding their limitations.

2. Introduction of SSP-LSTM and SSP-Attention that outperform baselines by 45.7% in accuracy and expand user coverage by 24.5% via Add2Bag interactions.

3. Analysis of model latency showing SSP models can make predictions in under 15ms, viable for real-time use.

The proposed Tailor solution with its customized models advance the state-of-the-art in size recommendations for high-end online fashion. Key innovations include sequence-based user modeling and integration of implicit feedback signals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two sequence classification models, SSP-LSTM and SSP-Attention, for size recommendations in luxury fashion e-commerce that achieve improved accuracy by incorporating both implicit and explicit user signals in the form of event sequences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Findings regarding size recommendations within a high-end fashion marketplace, accompanied by an evaluation of how existing baselines perform when faced with complex data sets.

2) Introduction of two models (SSP-LSTM and SSP-Attention) that make use of additional customer signals such as Add2Bag interactions and feedback from returned orders.

3) Analysis of the models' latency to validate their usability in real-time recommendation scenarios.

In summary, the paper proposes two novel sequence classification models for size recommendations that outperform existing baselines, while also demonstrating the models' viability for production use through latency benchmarking experiments. The usage of additional implicit customer signals beyond just order history is another key contribution for improving accuracy and coverage.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two models SSP-LSTM and SSP-Attention. What are the key differences in the architectures of these two models? What are the trade-offs between them in terms of accuracy and inference latency?

2. The SSP models encode the user history as a sequence of events. What types of events are used in the event history? Why is a sequence-based representation helpful compared to just using the user ID?

3. The paper transforms the thousands of raw sizes into size positions to reduce sparsity. How is the size position defined and what are its benefits? How does this pre-processing step impact model accuracy?

4. The SSP models are evaluated on 4 scenarios - General, Multiple Gender, VIP and Training users. What is the motivation behind creating these subsets? What insights do the results on these subsets provide? 

5. What is the significance of using Add2Bag interactions in the SSP models? How does it help with coverage and accuracy compared to just using orders? What are the results of the ablation study on this?

6. Return reasons are encoded in the order events in the SSP models. What are the potential benefits of providing this explicit negative signal? What do the results show regarding its impact?

7. For real-time recommendation, latency is critical. How do the models compare in terms of latency across different batch sizes and history lengths? What are the key factors influencing latency?

8. The paper evaluates strong baselines - SFNet and PMCV. How do these compare with the SSP models? When does SFNet perform better than the SSP models?

9. The SSP models perform worse on the VIP users compared to general. What could be the reasons behind this unexpected behavior? How can the models be improved for power users?

10. The paper focuses only on transactional data for size recommendation. What are some ideas discussed for potential future work leveraging additional signals like measurements, body shape etc.? What challenges might exist in gathering such data?
