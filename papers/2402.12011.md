# [A Systematic Comparison of Contextualized Word Embeddings for Lexical   Semantic Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating and comparing models for lexical semantic change (LSC) is challenging due to diverse settings and conditions in current literature. This makes performance comparisons misleading.
- Current LSC evaluations focus solely on graded change detection (GCD) and ignore other crucial aspects like modeling word meanings and interpreting detected changes.

Proposed Solution:
- Systematically evaluate models on GCD using equal settings across 8 languages to enable fair comparison. Models tested: BERT, mBERT, XLM-R, XL-LEXEME. 
- Assess models as computational annotators by evaluating on Word-in-Context (WiC), Word Sense Induction (WSI) and GCD. This tests their ability to model meanings.
- Compare GPT-4 to contextualized models on WiC, WSI and GCD.

Main Contributions:
- First comparable evaluation of models for LSC under equal conditions across 8 languages. XL-LEXEME outperforms others on GCD.
- First assessment of contextualized models' ability to distinguish word meanings (WiC and WSI). XL-LEXEME and GPT-4 perform close to human level.  
- Comparison shows XL-LEXEME achieves similar performance as GPT-4 at lower cost. Argues use of GPT-4 is not justified.
- Highlights need to model word meanings over time, not just extent of change. Calls for focus on how, when and why words change.

The paper establishes clear evaluation settings for fair comparison of LSC models in future work and advocates shifting focus to modeling word sense changes rather than solely improving graded change detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a systematic comparison of contextualized word embedding models and approaches for modeling lexical semantic change across eight languages, finding XL-LEXEME to consistently outperform others for graded change detection while still underperforming human performance for fine-grained tasks like word-in-context judgments and word sense induction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides the first systematic comparison of contextualized word embedding models and approaches for modeling lexical semantic change (LSC) across eight languages under equal settings and conditions. 

2) It evaluates the ability of these models to perform word-in-context (WiC) judgments and word sense induction (WSI), in addition to the commonly evaluated graded change detection (GCD) task. This provides insights into their ability to capture nuanced word meanings over time.

3) It compares the recent XL-LEXEME model to GPT-4 on the English benchmark across the WiC, WSI and GCD tasks. It finds that XL-LEXEME obtains comparable performance to GPT-4 at a lower cost, arguing that the use of GPT-4 is not justified for modeling LSC.

4) Based on the evaluations, it argues that the current focus solely on GCD is limited, and there needs to be more emphasis on modeling how and why word meanings change over time by distinguishing different word senses. It advocates for advances in unsupervised and supervised modeling of word meanings for LSC.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive, comparative evaluation of models for LSC across languages and tasks, providing insights and laying groundwork for advancing LSC modeling.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Lexical semantic change (LSC)
- Graded change detection (GCD) 
- Word-in-context (WiC)
- Word sense induction (WSI)
- Diachronic word usage graphs (DWUG)
- Form-based approaches (e.g. average pairwise distance (APD), prototype distance (PRT))
- Sense-based approaches (e.g. affinity propagation + Jensen-Shannon divergence (AP+JSD), A Posteriori affinity propagation + average pairwise distance (WiDiD))
- Contextualized word embeddings (BERT, mBERT, XLM-R, XL-LEXEME)
- Unsupervised vs supervised approaches
- Computational annotation/annotators
- Spearman correlation
- Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
- Purity (PUR)

The key goals of the paper are to:

- Systematically evaluate approaches for GCD under equal conditions 
- Assess contextualized models on WiC and WSI tasks 
- Compare GPT-4 to contextualized models
- Argue that performance on GCD alone does not solve LSC problem - need to model word senses and how they change over time

In summary, the key terms revolve around evaluating computational models for lexical semantic change across different subtasks, with a focus on modeling word meanings and their changes.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that comparing performance on Graded Change Detection (GCD) across different works can be misleading due to differences in settings and conditions. What are some key factors that can make the comparison of GCD performance unfair or unclear?

2. The paper evaluates both form-based and sense-based approaches to GCD. What are the key differences between these two types of approaches and what are some of their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

3. The paper finds that the APD (Average Pairwise Distance) approach consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to alternatives like PRT (Prototype Embeddings). What properties of the APD measure make it well-suited for quantifying semantic change?

4. The paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation of contextualized models through Word-in-Context (WiC) and Word Sense Induction (WSI) tasks. What insight does performance on these tasks give about the models' suitability for lexical semantic change tasks?

5. The paper argues that obtaining state-of-the-art performance on GCD does not solve the full complexity of modeling lexical semantic change. What are some limitations of only focusing on GCD? What additional challenges need to be addressed?

6. The XL-LEXEME model demonstrated strong performance across different tasks and languages in the paper. What properties of this model make it well-suited for lexical semantic change compared to models like mBERT and XLM-R?

7. The paper found low performance across models on the Word Sense Induction task. What makes this task inherently difficult? What approaches could be taken to try to improve performance?

8. The paper argues that the use of GPT-4 is not justified for modeling lexical semantic change compared to XL-LEXEME. What factors support preferring the use of XL-LEXEME over GPT-4 for these tasks?

9. The paper discusses some discrepancies between performance reported here versus prior state-of-the-art results on GCD. What are some potential reasons for these discrepancies?

10. The paper advocates shifting focus from quantifying semantic change to explaining the specific changes in word meanings over time. What methods could help better model and explain diachronic sense changes?
