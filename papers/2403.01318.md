# [High-Dimensional Tail Index Regression: with An Application to Text   Analyses of Viral Posts in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01318)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper is motivated by modeling the tail features of credit distributions (e.g. number of "likes") for viral posts in social media. Empirical evidence shows these credit distributions follow a power law. The goal is to study the effect of text features (words) in posts on the tail index parameter α(X) of this power law distribution. This allows assessing which words contribute to more "viral" posts that attract wider attention and extreme number of credits. Analyzing these effects requires dealing with high-dimensional text features, which poses statistical challenges.

Proposed Method:
The paper proposes a high-dimensional tail index regression (HDTIR) method to estimate the conditional tail index α(X) and infer the effects of high-dimensional text features X on α(X). The method is based on an L1-regularized maximum likelihood estimator, which is shown to be consistent. To enable statistical inference, a debiased estimator is further proposed based on either sample splitting or cross-fitting, and is shown to be asymptotically normal. The method is also extended to estimate conditional extreme quantiles.

Main Contributions:
- First paper to systematically study estimation and inference theory for high dimensional tail index regression models, which allows assessing effects of high-dimensional features on tail behavior 
- Proposed a computationally efficient regularized estimator, established its consistency and convergence rates
- Proposed debiased estimators based on sample splitting and cross-fitting for statistical inference, and established their asymptotic normality 
- Extended the method to conditional extreme quantiles and established theoretical properties
- Provided empirical evidence on the excellent finite sample performance via simulations
- Applied the method for an important empirical problem of analyzing text features associated with viral posts in social media
