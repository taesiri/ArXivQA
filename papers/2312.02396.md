# [Unsupervised Change Detection for Space Habitats Using 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02396)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Future deep space habitats like the lunar Gateway will be uncrewed for long periods of time. Autonomous robotic systems will be critical for monitoring and maintaining these habitats. Existing anomaly detection methods for the International Space Station (ISS) rely on manually-labeled images or semantic information. This limits the ability to detect new, unseen changes in the environment. The paper aims to develop an unsupervised algorithm that can detect multiple scene changes directly from 3D point clouds, without relying on images or semantics.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper presents an unsupervised change detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering and the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) metric. The algorithm takes two point clouds captured at different times as input. It uses an Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique to cluster each point cloud into a GMM representation. It then computes the EMD between the GMMs of the two point clouds to identify clusters contributing the most change. These clusters represent detected scene changes.

Main Contributions:
- Detects multiple appearing or disappearing changes in a scene from only 3D depth data, without manual labels or semantics.
- Demonstrated on real sensor data collected with an Astrobee robot in a NASA lab simulating a space habitat. Detected changes like adding or removing large objects.
- Analyzes impact on accuracy of varying number of GMM clusters and using PCA to reduce data dimensionality. Varying clusters trades off change region size vs. computation time. PCA reduces runtime by 10% with same accuracy. 
- Presents detailed computational performance analysis. EM clustering takes up most runtime, increasing linearly with number of clusters.
- Open-sources implementation to enable further research.
- First openly available change detection software using only 3D point clouds as input.
