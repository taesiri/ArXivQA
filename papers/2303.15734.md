# [Adaptive Background Music for a Fighting Game: A Multi-Instrument Volume   Modulation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15734)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Background music (BGM) is important for enhancing player experience in video games, but typical BGM implementations use pre-composed looped songs which fail to capture the dynamics of gameplay. 
- There has been little prior research on adaptive BGM specifically for fighting games to match the intensity of combat.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents an adaptive BGM system for the fighting game platform DareFightingICE, consisting of 5 classical instruments playing "Air on G-String."
- Each instrument's volume is connected to a different in-game element: player 1 HP, player 1 EP, player 2 HP, player 2 EP, and distance between players. 
- As these elements change during a match, the volumes modulate to reflect the game state and action intensity.

Evaluation:
- A blind deep reinforcement learning AI agent using only audio input is trained with and without the adaptive BGM.
- The AI exhibits significantly improved performance with the adaptive BGM across multiple sound designs and encoders.
- This indicates the BGM provides useful state information the AI can leverage.

Main Contributions:
- First adaptive music approach focused on fighting games using multiple instruments for modulation.
- Provides relevant game state information to players via changes in BGM instrumentation.  
- Improves gameplay experience and performance for both human and AI players.
- Evaluated on multiple versions of DareFightingICE platform.

In summary, the paper presents a novel adaptive BGM method for fighting games using volume modulation of classical instruments tied to gameplay elements. Experiments show this BGM gives useful state information that improves AI agent performance.
