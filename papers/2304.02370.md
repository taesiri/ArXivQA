# [Effective control of two-dimensional Rayleigh--Bénard convection:   invariant multi-agent reinforcement learning is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02370)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the central research question seems to be:How can deep reinforcement learning (DRL) be applied effectively to control two-dimensional Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) using sensor-based feedback control?Specifically, the authors aim to show:- Invariant multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be leveraged to take advantage of the locality and translational invariance inherent to RBC flows inside wide channels. This allows increasing the number of control segments without encountering the curse of dimensionality from a naive increase in DRL action size.- MARL can discover an advanced control strategy that destabilizes the spontaneous RBC double-cell pattern, changes the topology by coalescing cells, and actively controls the resulting cell to a new stable configuration. - This modified flow configuration achieved through MARL control results in reduced convective heat transfer, which is useful for industrial processes.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that MARL can enable effective sensor-based feedback control of RBC systems by overcoming challenges like the curse of dimensionality and discovering non-intuitive control strategies that improve heat transfer characteristics. The paper aims to demonstrate this through numerical simulations of a 2D RBC system.
