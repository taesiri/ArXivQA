# [gaHealth: An English-Irish Bilingual Corpus of Health Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03575)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation (MT) models require large parallel corpora for training, but such resources are scarce for low-resource languages like Irish. 
- Existing corpora are often multi-domain and not domain-specific (e.g. health domain), which limits translation quality.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop gaHealth, the first English-Irish parallel corpus of health data consisting of 16k sentence pairs from freely available government documents.
- Create a processing pipeline with text extraction, normalization, alignment and cleaning tools tailored for handling PDFs and informal texts. 
- Define corpus development guidelines like handling whitespace, language detection parameters etc.
- Train Transformer neural MT models on gaHealth corpus for English-Irish and Irish-English translation.

Results/Contributions:
- Models trained on in-domain gaHealth corpus achieve much better BLEU scores compared to top systems from LoResMT 2021 Shared Task - 37.6 vs 36.0 for EN-GA and 57.6 vs 34.6 for GA-EN.
- Establish benefits of using smaller in-domain parallel corpora over larger generic corpora for low-resource MT.  
- Release gaHealth corpus and models to advance Irish language MT research. Corpus can be extended to other domains.
- Provide useful guidelines and learnings on developing parallel corpora from multilingual documents.

In summary, the paper presents the creation of the first domain-specific parallel corpus for Irish language MT which leads to improved translation quality. The resources and insights developed will enable further advancement of this low-resource language pair.
