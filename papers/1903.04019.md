# [Deep Reinforcement Learning of Volume-guided Progressive View Inpainting   for 3D Point Scene Completion from a Single Depth Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04019)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we achieve high-quality 3D scene completion from a single depth image, focusing on directly generating the missing 3D point cloud surface?

The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question are:

- Representing the incomplete 3D point cloud as multi-view depth maps and performing iterative 2D inpainting on them to fill in missing surfaces.

- Using a volumetric 3D scene reconstruction to guide the 2D inpainting by providing global context. 

- Employing a reinforcement learning strategy to determine the optimal sequence of viewpoints for progressive completion.

- Proposing a volume-guided view inpainting network that combines 3D completion and 2D inpainting with a differentiable projection layer between them.

- Achieving state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complete 3D point cloud scenes from single depth images compared to previous volumetric output methods.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of high-quality 3D scene completion from limited single view depth data by using guided multi-view 2D inpainting and optimal view planning with deep reinforcement learning. The key hypothesis is that this approach can generate more accurate and complete 3D point clouds than existing volumetric methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The first surface-based algorithm for 3D scene completion from a single depth image by directly generating the missing points. Previous methods have used volumetric representations which result in low-resolution outputs. 

2. A novel deep reinforcement learning strategy for determining the optimal sequence of viewpoints for progressive scene completion. This allows selecting the best views to fill in missing information.

3. A volume-guided view inpainting network that utilizes both a 2D inpainting network and a 3D completion network. This makes full use of global context to produce high-quality outputs.

In summary, the key innovations seem to be:

- Directly predicting point clouds rather than volumetric outputs to achieve high-resolution scene completion. 

- Using deep reinforcement learning for optimal view planning during the completion process.

- Leveraging both 2D and 3D networks jointly for context-aware depth map inpainting across views.

The combination of these ideas allows high-quality 3D scene completion from only a single input depth image.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method for progressively inpainting and completing a 3D scene point cloud from a single depth image by iteratively selecting optimal views to inpaint missing information under guidance from a low-resolution volumetric reconstruction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is an analysis of how it compares to other research in the field of single image 3D scene completion:

- The main contribution of this paper is presenting an end-to-end deep learning method for completing 3D scenes from a single depth image. The key ideas are: 1) Directly predicting point clouds rather than voxels to achieve higher resolution outputs. 2) Using multi-view depth map inpainting with a reinforcement learning view planning strategy. 

- Most prior work has focused on voxel-based completion using 3D convolutions (SSCNet, ScanComplete, etc). A limitation is the low output resolution. This paper addresses that by working directly with point clouds.

- Some recent works like See Through Shading and View-Volume Network also try to leverage 2D depth features, but do per-view completion independently without multi-view aggregation and global planning. This paper proposes a more unified approach.

- The volume-guided view inpainting network draws connections to image inpainting techniques while providing global 3D context. The DQN view planning is novel for this application.

- For evaluation, the paper provides extensive quantitative experiments on synthetic data showing advantages over leading voxel-based methods and ablation studies to validate the method design.

In summary, the key novelty of this paper compared to prior work is in directly generating high resolution point clouds through multi-view depth completion guided by learned global planning. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the single image 3D completion task. The ideas could potentially generalize to other view-based 3D understanding problems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Leveraging texture information from the input RGBD images to achieve more accurate depth inpainting. The current method focuses only on depth information for inpainting, but the authors suggest exploring how to also utilize the color/texture data from RGB images to improve results.

- Joint texture and depth completion. The current method completes only the depth/geometry of the scene. The authors suggest extending it to also generate and complete texture information to output a full color+geometry 3D scene. 

- Exploration of other potential applications and tasks that could benefit from the volume-guided view inpainting approach proposed in this work. The authors developed this technique for 3D scene completion, but suggest it could also be useful for other problems where multi-view depth map inpainting would be helpful.

- Improving efficiency and speed. The current approach takes about 60s per scene which could be slow for some applications. The authors suggest further work on optimizing the efficiency of the approach.

- Evaluating on more varied and complex datasets. The method was only evaluated on SUNCG scenes. Testing on more complex and diverse scenes could further validate the robustness.

- Exploring alternatives to the fixed pre-defined viewpoint sampling for the DQN view planning. The predefined discrete sampling could be limiting, so researching more flexible viewpoint planning could help.

In summary, the main directions are around improving the depth inpainting with texture, jointly completing texture and geometry, applying the approach to new applications, improving efficiency, testing generalization ability, and enhancing the viewpoint planning flexibility.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a deep reinforcement learning method for 3D point scene completion from a single depth image. The approach involves three main steps: (1) reconstructing a low-resolution 3D voxel volume from the input depth image using a 3D CNN; (2) iteratively selecting the next best view using a Deep Q-Network and inpainting the corresponding depth map using a 2D CNN guided by projecting the volume; (3) integrating the inpainted depth maps into an improved 3D point cloud. A differentiable projection layer connects the 3D and 2D CNNs for joint training. The goal is to fill in missing surfaces not visible in the original view by inpainting multiple novel views selected to maximize information gain. Experiments demonstrate the approach outperforms existing volumetric completion methods in accuracy and detail. The key innovations are the multi-view inpainting strategy, volume-guided inpainting network, and learned view planning policy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning method for 3D scene completion from a single depth image. The approach involves progressively inpainting multiple depth map views of the incomplete 3D point cloud converted from the input depth image. First, an initial 3D volume is reconstructed from the input point cloud. This volume is used to guide the inpainting of the first view's depth map using a 2D convolutional neural network. The inpainted depth map is converted to 3D points and aggregated to the input point cloud. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) is then used to determine the next best view, whose depth map is again inpainted using the updated point cloud and volume. This process repeats, progressively completing the scene across multiple novel views chosen by the DQN, until the scene is adequately reconstructed. 

The volume-guided view inpainting network combines a 3D completion network to obtain a volumetric reconstruction and a 2D inpainting network to fill in depth maps guided by the projected 3D volume. This provides global context to aid depth map completion. The DQN policy network is trained to pick the best next views that maximize completeness and inpainting accuracy rewards. Experiments demonstrate the approach produces higher quality scene completions compared to existing volumetric output methods and ablations validate the benefits of the guided inpainting and DQN view planning. The method represents the first surface-based approach for single-view scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method for 3D scene completion from a single depth image. The approach consists of three main modules - 3D volume reconstruction, 2D depth map inpainting, and multi-view selection for completion. First, an incomplete 3D point cloud is reconstructed from the input depth image. This point cloud is used to produce a low-resolution 3D volumetric reconstruction that provides global context. The point cloud is then projected to generate multi-view depth maps, which contain holes in occluded areas. A deep reinforcement learning agent selects the next best viewpoint, and the corresponding depth map is inpainted using a novel volume-guided network that utilizes the global context from the 3D volume. The inpainted depth is fused back into the evolving point cloud. This process is repeated, with the agent selecting subsequent best views for inpainting until the scene is adequately completed. The three modules are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner to enable iterative inpainting guided by global context for high-quality 3D scene completion.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and question addressed in this paper are:

- The paper focuses on the task of 3D scene completion from a single depth image. This is an important problem in computer vision, since depth images captured from a single view often have large missing/occluded regions, making full 3D understanding challenging. 

- Existing methods for this problem mainly take a volumetric approach, representing the 3D scene as a voxel grid and using 3D convolutional networks to complete the voxels. However, these volumetric methods tend to produce low-resolution outputs. 

- The key question addressed is: how can we achieve high-resolution completion of the 3D point cloud surface from a single depth image input?

- To address this, the paper proposes a surface-based approach to directly generate missing 3D points by conducting multi-view depth completion, rather than relying on volumetric representations.

In summary, the main problem addressed is how to achieve high-quality 3D scene completion from a single depth image, by directly predicting the missing 3D point cloud surface rather than low-resolution voxel occupancies. The key question is how to effectively complete the surface points across multiple views.
