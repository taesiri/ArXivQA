# [Deep Learning for In-Orbit Cloud Segmentation and Classification in   Hyperspectral Satellite Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper explores deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for cloud segmentation and classification in hyperspectral satellite imagery. There is a need for computationally efficient and accurate models that can be deployed on satellites with limited onboard resources. The key challenges are balancing model accuracy, size, inference time and sensor independence.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper evaluates three state-of-the-art CNN models - nnU-Net, 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple, and 1D-Justo-LiuNet on the NASA EO-1 Hyperion dataset. The models are trained and tested using varying numbers of spectral bands selected through principal component analysis (PCA). Performance metrics assessed include pixel accuracy, dice coefficient, classification accuracy and F1 score. Additionally, model size, inference times and generalization on a commercial satellite dataset are analyzed.

Key Results:
1D-Justo-LiuNet achieves the highest accuracy using all 98 bands but has longer inference times. With fewer bands, nnU-Net is most accurate but has a large model size. 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple offers the best balance - with 6 PCA-selected bands it has fast inference, high accuracy and very small model size. All models achieve sensor independence as evidenced by good visual performance on the commercial dataset.  

Main Contributions:
- Evaluation of latest deep learning models for in-orbit cloud segmentation 
- Analysis of impact of reducing spectral bands via PCA on model performance
- Identification of an optimal model (2D-Justo-UNet-Simple) that balances accuracy, speed and size
- Demonstration of model generalization capability to different sensors

In summary, the paper provides useful guidelines and model recommendations for onboard deployment of deep learning for satellite-based cloud analytics. The compact 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple emerges as a promising solution for efficient and accurate cloud detection in orbit.
