# [Solving Quantitative Reasoning Problems with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14858)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can language models be improved to better solve quantitative reasoning problems, such as mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college level?

The paper notes that while large language models have achieved impressive performance on many natural language tasks, they have generally struggled on tasks requiring quantitative reasoning. The authors aim to address this gap by developing a language model called Minerva that is specifically trained on technical content and achieves state-of-the-art performance on quantitative reasoning benchmarks. 

The key ideas explored are:

- Pretraining a language model on a large dataset of technical material from sources like arXiv and math-heavy websites. This juxtaposes natural language with formal mathematical language to improve the model's ability to parse and generate mathematical expressions.

- Evaluating the model on datasets of math and science problems from middle school to undergraduate level, where it must generate complete step-by-step solutions.

- Using inference techniques like sampling multiple solutions per problem and selecting the most frequent one to boost performance over greedy decoding.

- Analyzing the model's mistakes and probing the degree to which its solutions rely on memorization versus true reasoning.

So in summary, the central research question is how to develop language models that can accurately solve technical quantitative reasoning problems, and the key hypothesis is that pretraining on technical data along with inference optimizations can substantially improve performance on these tasks.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can large language models be improved to better solve quantitative reasoning problems, such as mathematical, scientific, and engineering problems typically found at the college level?

The authors note that while large language models have achieved impressive performance on many natural language tasks, they have generally struggled on tasks requiring more robust quantitative reasoning abilities. 

To address this limitation, the authors introduce Minerva, a large language model trained on a combination of natural language data and technical/mathematical content. The goal is to equip the model with stronger skills for mathematical reasoning and computation in order to solve quantitative problems expressed in natural language, without relying on external tools.

The key hypothesis appears to be that by training the model on a high-quality dataset containing both natural language and formal mathematical expressions, the model can learn to parse problems stated in natural language, recall relevant facts and procedures, perform symbolic manipulations and calculations, and generate step-by-step solutions. 

The authors test this hypothesis by evaluating Minerva on math and science exam questions and comparing its performance to other models. The central research question is whether their approach of training on technical data can yield improved quantitative reasoning abilities in large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Developing Minerva, a large language model trained on a high-quality dataset of mathematical and scientific content. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on quantitative reasoning benchmarks without using external tools.

- Creating a large training dataset that combines natural language with formal mathematical language like equations and diagrams. This allows the model to learn to transition between natural language explanations and formal mathematical expressions.

- Evaluating the model on over 200 real undergraduate-level STEM problems that require multi-step reasoning and quantitative skills. The model can correctly solve about a third of them.

- Establishing strong baselines for the performance of large language models on mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks by pretraining on high quality domain-specific data and using improved inference techniques like majority vote.

- Analyzing factors like false positives and potential memorization to better understand the strengths and limitations of the model's reasoning abilities.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be advancing language models' capabilities on quantitative reasoning by curating a mathematical training dataset and evaluating on challenging problems, while analyzing the models' skills and limitations. The work helps establish baselines for model performance on mathematical reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of Minerva, a large language model pretrained on natural language data and further trained on technical/scientific content. Minerva achieves state-of-the-art performance on several quantitative reasoning benchmarks without relying on external tools.

2. The creation of a large training dataset combining natural language data with mathematical/scientific text from arXiv and math-heavy webpages. The key novelty is the juxtaposition of natural language text with formal mathematical language like equations and diagrams.

3. Strong quantitative reasoning results, including:
- State-of-the-art on MATH, GSM8k, and MMLU-STEM benchmarks with few-shot prompting
- Solving 30% of 200+ undergraduate-level STEM problems in physics, chemistry, biology, etc.
- High scores on standardized high school math exams from Poland and the UK

4. Analysis indicating that Minerva's strong performance is not simply due to memorization of the training data or test problems. This includes testing on modified problems, limiting solutions to those dissimilar from targets, and directly searching for overlaps.

5. A new baseline for solving mathematical word problems using self-contained reasoning fully expressed in natural language, without relying on an external calculator, computer algebra system, etc.

In summary, the main contribution is showing that scaling up model size and training data quality enables language models to achieve strong quantitative reasoning performance when solving problems formulated in natural language. The paper analyzes the scope and limitations of this approach.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are a few points comparing it to other related research:

- The paper introduces a new dataset, OCWCourses, for evaluating scientific reasoning abilities of language models. This adds to existing datasets like MATH and GSM8k for testing math word problems and commonsense reasoning. The OCWCourses data seems unique in focusing on multi-step, undergraduate-level scientific problems across fields like physics, chemistry, and biology. 

- The authors train large language models (up to 540B parameters) on a custom dataset of mathematical and scientific text from arXiv and math webpages. Other recent works have also scaled up models and trained on technical data, but the training set here seems more focused on retaining mathematical notation and equations.

- For model evaluation, the paper emphasizes sampling multiple solutions and using majority vote for selecting the final prediction. This confirms findings from some recent works showing benefits of these inference techniques.

- The models achieve new state-of-the-art results on the math word problem datasets. The gains are especially significant on MATH, likely owing to the technical training data and bigger models. Performance on the new OCWCourses seems reasonable for an initial result without task-specific training.

- An analysis of memorization suggests the MATH gains do not simply come from memorizing problems or solutions, an issue for some recent models. The analysis seems quite thorough compared to what I've seen in other papers.

- There is limited comparison to "formal methods" that use logic and theorem proving for mathematical reasoning. Integrating these approaches with language models could be an interesting direction for future work.

Overall, the work feels like an incremental but solid advance in language models for mathematical and scientific reasoning, thanks to model scaling, technical training data, and inference techniques. The OCWCourses dataset could catalyze more research in this direction. More rigorous testing against human performance would help better understand current capabilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to related work in the field:

The key contributions of this paper are the development of a large language model called Minerva trained on mathematical and scientific text, and its evaluation on quantitative reasoning benchmarks. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on datasets like MATH, GSM8k, and MMLU without any task-specific fine-tuning. 

This work builds upon previous research showing that large language models can achieve strong performance on mathematical and scientific tasks when trained on relevant datasets. For example, Codex (Chen et al. 2021) showed impressive results on math word problems after training on Python code. Other related works have trained language models on formal mathematical corpora to predict expressions and proofs (Lample & Charton, 2020; Han et al. 2022). 

The main novelty of this paper is the pretraining dataset combining natural language and formal mathematical notation scraped from the web and arXiv. This allows Minerva to handle mixed text/math problems better than previous methods. The scale of the model and compute resources used is also larger than related works.

Compared to Codex and other code generating models, Minerva is directly evaluated on its internal reasoning skills rather than its ability to call APIs. This is a harder test that probes deeper quantitative reasoning abilities.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state of the art in language models for scientific reasoning by pretraining on high quality mathematical text at scale. The rigorous evaluations demonstrate strengths and limitations of this approach. Remaining challenges include improving robustness, verifying reasoning, and reducing memorization. This provides a strong baseline for future research on quantitative reasoning with language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing models that can provide verifiable reasoning and explanations for their solutions to quantitative reasoning problems. The authors note that their approach currently has no automatic way to verify the correctness of the model's reasoning process. Integrating ideas from formal verification to provide provable reasoning chains could be an interesting direction.

- Combining the natural language approach with other complementary techniques like code generation and formal mathematics. The authors mention that different approaches have different strengths, so combining natural language reasoning with symbolic manipulation and access to computational tools could lead to more capable models.

- Scaling up model size and training on additional technical data to further improve performance on quantitative reasoning benchmarks. The authors show bigger models perform better, suggesting pushing scale even further could lead to additional gains.

- Designing models with better compositional and systematic generalization on quantitative reasoning problems. While the models show some generalization, performance degrades when problems are modified significantly. Developing models that can learn more systematic and compositional reasoning skills is an open challenge.

- Applying models to real-world quantitative reasoning tasks like STEM problem solving or automating mathematical proof generation. Moving beyond standardized benchmarks to real applications could reveal new challenges and requirements.

- Exploring societal impacts and applications like developing quantitative reasoning tutors. The authors mention broader societal impacts as an important consideration going forward.

In summary, some of the key themes are integrating complementary techniques, scaling up models, improving generalization, and applying models to real-world tasks. Pushing research in these directions could lead to more capable and useful models for quantitative reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust models and evaluation methods to reduce false positives and ensure models are solving problems through genuine reasoning rather than memorization or pattern matching. The authors suggest this could involve creating modified/perturbed versions of test problems or more rigorous verification of reasoning steps.

- Combining the natural language approach demonstrated here with more formal mathematical reasoning methods like proof assistants. The authors note their method currently has no automated way to verify reasoning, unlike formal methods. Integrating the two could provide natural language explainability with formal verifiability.

- Exploring other model architectures like graph neural networks that can better capture the structural relationships in mathematical expressions. The authors note transformers excel at modeling natural language but other architectures may be better suited for symbolic reasoning.

- Training and evaluating models on additional challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, like higher level college math and physics problems. The authors created a new benchmark dataset for this purpose but suggest more work is needed.

- Applying these math reasoning models to downstream tasks like tutoring systems. The authors say a robust quantitative reasoning agent could support education.

- Analyzing societal impacts and applications more deeply given the potential of more capable math reasoning models.

In summary, the key directions encompass developing more robust and verified models, combining natural language and formal reasoning, using alternative model architectures, creating more benchmarks, and analyzing applications and impacts. The authors lay out an extensive research agenda for math reasoning with language models.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main question it is addressing is how to develop language models that are capable of quantitative reasoning and solving technical problems in areas like math, science, and engineering. 

Some key points about the problem:

- Language models have achieved great performance on natural language tasks, but generally struggle on quantitative reasoning problems that require mathematical calculations, logical thinking, etc.
