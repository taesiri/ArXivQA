# [Tree-Ring Watermarks: Fingerprints for Diffusion Images that are   Invisible and Robust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20030)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper introduces a new method for watermarking images generated by diffusion models. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to imperceptibly fingerprint diffusion model outputs by subtly influencing the sampling process itself, rather than making post-hoc modifications to generated images. Specifically, the authors propose "Tree-Ring Watermarking" which embeds patterns into the initial noise vectors that seed the diffusion process. The key claims are:

- This "distributional" watermarking approach allows fingerprints that are truly invisible, unlike existing methods that visibly alter images.

- Watermarks can be embedded into the Fourier transform of noise vectors in a way that is invariant to many image transformations, making the method highly robust.

- The technique requires no retraining or finetuning of models, and can be applied to any diffusion model.

- Watermark detection is performed by inverting the diffusion process to uncover the fingerprinted noise vector.

The main research questions are whether such invisible and robust watermarking is possible by influencing the generative process, and how to construct noise vector patterns to maximize robustness. The paper presents experiments across models and transformations to evaluate these claims.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that diffusion image generation can be imperceptibly fingerprinted by structured modifications to the noise vectors that seed the process. The paper aims to demonstrate this is possible, robust, and widely applicable.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we develop an effective and robust watermarking technique for generative diffusion models like Stable Diffusion? 

The key goals and hypotheses appear to be:

- Develop a watermarking approach that is completely invisible in the image space, unlike prior work that makes small modifications to images. 

- The watermark should be reliably detectable even after common image manipulations like cropping, rotation, noise, etc. It should be more robust than existing watermarking methods.

- The watermarking technique should be simple to implement and require no retraining or finetuning of diffusion models. It should work as a plug-in to existing model APIs.

- Watermarking should have a negligible impact on the image quality and diversity of generations.

The central hypothesis seems to be that by subtly modifying the noise vector used to initialize diffusion sampling, rather than the final image, it is possible to create a robust and invisible watermark. The key idea is to embed watermark patterns in the Fourier space of the noise vector, structured so they are unaffected by common image manipulations.

In summary, the main research question is how to create an imperceptible yet robust watermark for generative diffusion models, through clever manipulation of the initial noise vectors. The hypothesis is that this proposed "Tree-Ring Watermarking" approach will outperform existing techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel technique called Tree-Ring Watermarking for robustly fingerprinting diffusion model outputs. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the sampling process by embedding a pattern into the initial noise vector, rather than making post-hoc modifications to images. This results in a truly invisible watermark on a per-sample basis.

- The patterns embedded in the noise vector are structured in Fourier space to be invariant to common image transformations like crops, dilations, flips, and rotations.

- Watermark detection works by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector and check for the embedded pattern. This allows detection without access to the original conditioning text.

- Tree-Ring Watermarking can be easily implemented as a plug-in to existing diffusion model APIs with negligible impact on generation quality.

- The watermark is demonstrated to be far more robust than existing watermarking methods against transformations like crops, color changes, blur, noise, rotations, etc.

- The authors introduce ways to derive statistically rigorous p-values for detection that allow controlling the false positive rate.

In summary, Tree-Ring Watermarking provides a highly robust yet invisible way to fingerprint diffusion model outputs with negligible overhead, enabling tracing of model usage and mitigating potential harms. The core technical novelty is the structured watermarking of the noise vector rather than the image.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on watermarking generative models:

- This paper introduces a new approach called "Tree-Ring Watermarking" that subtly fingerprints the noise vectors used to generate images in diffusion models. This allows watermarking the image generation process itself rather than just imprinting a signal onto the final generated image.

- Existing watermarking methods like DwtDct and RivaGAN work by modifying the final generated image. Tree-Ring Watermarking is the first approach that does not rely on directly modifying the output image.

- Other recent work like Stable Signature and recipes for watermarking unconditional diffusion also aim to bake the watermark into the generative process. However, they require re-training or finetuning the model on watermarked data first. Tree-Ring Watermarking works on pre-trained models with no additional training needed.

- Most prior work evaluated watermark robustness to just a couple manipulations like cropping, noise, etc. This paper systematically evaluates robustness across a large suite of transformations and shows Tree-Ring Watermarking is far more robust than existing deployed methods.

- The paper also introduces a statistical test to assign P-values to detections, allowing control over the false positive rate. This helps avoid falsely accusing unrelated images of being watermarked.

- Limitations compared to some other work include that the watermark can only be detected by the model owner with access to the diffusion model parameters. Third parties cannot independently detect the watermark.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in generative model watermarking by introducing a new approach that fingerprints the generation process itself. The watermark is shown to be invisible, robust, and does not require retraining models. The evaluation is also more comprehensive than prior work.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in watermarking of generative models:

- This paper proposes a novel "Tree-Ring Watermarking" technique that fingerprints diffusion model outputs by subtly influencing the entire sampling process. This is different from existing methods that perform post-hoc modifications to images after sampling.

- The proposed watermark embeds patterns into the initial noise vector used for sampling in a way that is invisible to humans, instead of directly modifying the generated images. This makes the watermark truly "invisible".

- The watermark signal is detected by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector, rather than detecting modifications in the image itself. This makes it more robust against transformations.

- The proposed method requires no additional training or finetuning, unlike some prior work that trains neural networks for watermark encoding/decoding. It works with existing diffusion models as a plug-in.

- The watermark patterns are carefully constructed in Fourier space to be invariant to common image manipulations like crops, flips, rotations etc. This makes it more robust than existing deployed methods.

- Extensive experiments validate negligible impact on generation quality metrics like FID/CLIP score, high robustness against transformations, and usability for diverse conditional and unconditional diffusion models.

- Compared to related work, this paper presents the first watermarking technique specialized for diffusion models. The novel concepts of influencing the noise vectors and inverting diffusion make the watermark invisible and robust.

In summary, this paper makes significant advances over prior arts by proposing a watermarking approach well-suited for diffusion models. The novel concepts introduced result in a watermark that is semantically invisible and demonstrates substantially improved robustness.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the accuracy of the inverse DDIM process for recovering the initial noise vector from a diffusion image. The authors note that advances in inversion, such as the work on EDICT by Wallace et al., could further improve the detection power of the watermark.

- Exploring the capacity for supporting multiple unique keys that could be assigned to individual users of a diffusion model API. It is currently unclear how large this capacity is.

- Adapting the watermark approach to other sampling schemes besides DDIM, in case DDIM falls out of favor in the future.

- Developing ways for third parties to detect the watermark without relying solely on an API provided by the model owner. Currently the watermark can only be detected by parties with access to the diffusion model itself.

- Further improving robustness of the watermark against various data augmentations and perturbations. The authors demonstrate high robustness already, but see room for additional progress.

- Exploring additional possible watermark patterns beyond the zero, random, and ring patterns discussed in the paper. There may be other interesting and practical patterns to consider.

- Generalizing the approach beyond just images to other modalities like audio, video, and text.

So in summary, the main directions are improving inversion accuracy, supporting more keys, adapting to new sampling schemes, enabling third-party detection, boosting robustness further, exploring new patterns, and extending to other modalities. The core watermarking approach shows promise, but can potentially be expanded in these ways.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the accuracy of the inverse DDIM process used for watermark detection. They mention that advances in making the DDIM inversion more accurate, such as the work by Zhang et al. on inversion robustness, could also improve the effectiveness of their watermarking technique.

- Adapting the watermark to other sampling schemes besides DDIM, in case DDIM falls out of favor in the future. 

- Increasing the capacity for multiple keys, to assign unique keys to individual users of the API. It's currently unclear what the limits are on the number of distinct keys that can be reliably detected.

- Making the watermark detectable by third parties without relying on the API, which currently restricts detection to only the model owner. Modifications may be needed to allow broader watermark verification.

- Exploring additional types of watermark patterns beyond the ones they tested, as there may be other interesting and practical patterns to imprint into the Fourier space.

- Applying the general concept of imperceptibly modifying the output distribution, rather than just post-processing outputs, to other generative models besides diffusion models.

- Investigating the effectiveness when conditioning on varying strengths of text guidance, to robustly detect watermarks even when text guidance is unknown or not provided during detection.

In summary, the main directions are improving inversion accuracy, adapting to new sampling methods, increasing key capacity, enabling third-party detection, exploring more patterns, applying to other generative models, and handling varying text guidance strength. The core idea of subtly altering distributions shows promise for "invisible" watermarking.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new technique called Tree-Ring Watermarking for robustly fingerprinting outputs of diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. Existing watermarking methods modify images after generation, but Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the entire sampling process. It embeds a pattern into the initial noise vector's Fourier space so it is invariant to transformations like crops, dilations, flips, and rotations. After image generation, the watermark is detected by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector and check for the embedded signal. Experiments show this technique can be easily applied to arbitrary diffusion models with negligible impact on image quality. The watermark is invisible in image space yet far more robust than alternatives.

The key ideas are structuring watermark patterns in Fourier space for invariance and leveraging diffusion inversion to extract the noise vector for watermark detection. Three pattern types are proposed: Tree-Ring_Zeros for invariance through zeros, Tree-Ring_Rand using random Gaussian keys, and Tree-Ring_Rings with concentric rings at random values. Experiments on Stable Diffusion and an ImageNet diffusion model validate negligible FID increase and high robustness to crops, color changes, noise, blurring, rotations, etc. The patterns are statistically hidden and give controllable false positive rates. This enables a truly invisible yet detectable watermarking scheme as a plugin for existing diffusion models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a novel watermarking technique for diffusion models called Tree-Ring Watermarking. The key idea is to subtly alter the distribution of the initial noise vector used for sampling in the diffusion model. Specifically, a pattern (the "key") is embedded into the low frequency modes of the Fourier transform of the noise vector. This key can later be detected through diffusion inversion, which recovers an approximation of the original noise vector from a generated image. The embedded patterns are designed to be robust to common image transformations like rotations, flips, crops, etc. Tree-Ring Watermarking requires no additional training or finetuning of the diffusion model. It fingerprints the model's outputs in a way that is invisible to humans, yet detectable by the model owner. Overall, the method enables tracing the origin of generated images back to a particular diffusion model through algorithmic analysis, while having negligible impact on image quality.
