# [Tree-Ring Watermarks: Fingerprints for Diffusion Images that are   Invisible and Robust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20030)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper introduces a new method for watermarking images generated by diffusion models. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to imperceptibly fingerprint diffusion model outputs by subtly influencing the sampling process itself, rather than making post-hoc modifications to generated images. Specifically, the authors propose "Tree-Ring Watermarking" which embeds patterns into the initial noise vectors that seed the diffusion process. The key claims are:- This "distributional" watermarking approach allows fingerprints that are truly invisible, unlike existing methods that visibly alter images.- Watermarks can be embedded into the Fourier transform of noise vectors in a way that is invariant to many image transformations, making the method highly robust.- The technique requires no retraining or finetuning of models, and can be applied to any diffusion model.- Watermark detection is performed by inverting the diffusion process to uncover the fingerprinted noise vector.The main research questions are whether such invisible and robust watermarking is possible by influencing the generative process, and how to construct noise vector patterns to maximize robustness. The paper presents experiments across models and transformations to evaluate these claims.In summary, the central hypothesis is that diffusion image generation can be imperceptibly fingerprinted by structured modifications to the noise vectors that seed the process. The paper aims to demonstrate this is possible, robust, and widely applicable.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we develop an effective and robust watermarking technique for generative diffusion models like Stable Diffusion? The key goals and hypotheses appear to be:- Develop a watermarking approach that is completely invisible in the image space, unlike prior work that makes small modifications to images. - The watermark should be reliably detectable even after common image manipulations like cropping, rotation, noise, etc. It should be more robust than existing watermarking methods.- The watermarking technique should be simple to implement and require no retraining or finetuning of diffusion models. It should work as a plug-in to existing model APIs.- Watermarking should have a negligible impact on the image quality and diversity of generations.The central hypothesis seems to be that by subtly modifying the noise vector used to initialize diffusion sampling, rather than the final image, it is possible to create a robust and invisible watermark. The key idea is to embed watermark patterns in the Fourier space of the noise vector, structured so they are unaffected by common image manipulations.In summary, the main research question is how to create an imperceptible yet robust watermark for generative diffusion models, through clever manipulation of the initial noise vectors. The hypothesis is that this proposed "Tree-Ring Watermarking" approach will outperform existing techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel technique called Tree-Ring Watermarking for robustly fingerprinting diffusion model outputs. The key ideas and contributions are:- Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the sampling process by embedding a pattern into the initial noise vector, rather than making post-hoc modifications to images. This results in a truly invisible watermark on a per-sample basis.- The patterns embedded in the noise vector are structured in Fourier space to be invariant to common image transformations like crops, dilations, flips, and rotations.- Watermark detection works by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector and check for the embedded pattern. This allows detection without access to the original conditioning text.- Tree-Ring Watermarking can be easily implemented as a plug-in to existing diffusion model APIs with negligible impact on generation quality.- The watermark is demonstrated to be far more robust than existing watermarking methods against transformations like crops, color changes, blur, noise, rotations, etc.- The authors introduce ways to derive statistically rigorous p-values for detection that allow controlling the false positive rate.In summary, Tree-Ring Watermarking provides a highly robust yet invisible way to fingerprint diffusion model outputs with negligible overhead, enabling tracing of model usage and mitigating potential harms. The core technical novelty is the structured watermarking of the noise vector rather than the image.
