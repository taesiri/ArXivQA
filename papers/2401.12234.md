# [A Lightweight FPGA-based IDS-ECU Architecture for Automotive CAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vehicles are integrating more advanced electronic systems and connectivity features, which improves safety and comfort but also introduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Attacks against in-vehicle networks like Controller Area Network (CAN) have been demonstrated, exploiting the lack of built-in security. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a mitigation approach but add complexity due to high computational requirements. Integrating IDS as a separate Electronic Control Unit (ECU) also adds weight, cabling overhead and cost. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an IDS-ECU architecture that consolidates the IDS accelerator with traditional ECU functions on a hybrid FPGA, providing isolation but minimizing resource overhead. Two lightweight quantized Multi-Layer Perceptron (QMLP) models are proposed as IDS to detect Denial of Service, Fuzzing and Spoofing attacks with high accuracy. The QMLPs are hardware accelerated using off-the-shelf Deep Learning Processing Units (DPUs) from Xilinx. The DPU-based IDS operates transparently to software, processing each CAN message with minimal latency overhead.

Main Contributions:
1) Custom 8-bit QMLP IDS models achieving 99.96% accuracy on average across multiple attack vectors using the full CAN frame as input
2) IDS-ECU architecture with isolated IDS accelerator and traditional ECU function consolidated on a hybrid FPGA  
3) 2.3x lower detection latency per CAN message and 2.6x lower power consumption compared to state-of-the-art IDS approaches
4) 15x power savings compared to GPU implementation of quantized IDS model

In summary, the paper demonstrates an efficient consolidate IDS-ECU architecture using lightweight deep learning models to enable intrusion detection with minimal overheads. The FPGA integration ensures high accuracy, low latency and low power for protecting vehicular networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a consolidated electronic control unit architecture with intrusion detection capabilities for automotive Controller Area Network, using quantized machine learning models accelerated on field programmable gate arrays to achieve high accuracy and low latency threat detection with minimal overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting a custom 8-bit feed-forward quantised multi-layer perceptron (QMLP) based intrusion detection system (IDS) for automotive CAN, which achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy across multiple attack vectors using a single IDS ECU.

2) Proposing an IDS-integrated ECU architecture where the IDS is deployed using off-the-shelf Xilinx DPUs to model an AUTOSAR compliant architecture while allowing fully isolated execution of the IDS task. 

3) Showing that the tightly integrated approach achieves improvements in terms of per-message processing latency (2.3x reduction), power consumption (2.6x reduction) and detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art IDSs discussed in literature using standalone IDS architectures and loosely coupled accelerators (GPUs).

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an integrated IDS-ECU architecture using lightweight QMLP models that achieves better performance compared to prior works in multiple metrics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a consolidated ECU architecture that integrates IDS capabilities. What are the key advantages of this consolidated approach over having a dedicated IDS ECU on the network?

2. The paper uses two quantized MLP models for intrusion detection. Walk through the process of training, quantizing, and optimizing these MLP models using the Vitis-AI flow. What techniques are used to minimize the loss in accuracy during quantization?

3. The input feature set for the IDS consists of a concatenation of 4 successive CAN messages. Explain the rationale behind using this temporal feature set compared to just using a single CAN message. How does this impact the complexity and accuracy of the IDS?

4. The paper compares detection accuracy against several state-of-the-art IDS/IPS schemes. Analyze the relative strengths and weaknesses of rule-based, ML-based, and hybrid intrusion detection approaches for automotive systems. 

5. The Xilinx DPU is used as the accelerator for the IDS models. Compare and contrast the DPU against other FPGA-based deep learning accelerators like FINN and LUTNet in terms of accuracy, resource utilization and power efficiency.

6. The paper reports a 15X reduction in power consumption compared to a GPU implementation. Analyze the architectural optimizations and data movement strategies that contribute to the energy efficiency of the integrated IDS accelerator.

7. Cold start latency is an important consideration for automotive systems security. Discuss techniques to minimize the IDS cold start latency during ECU boot up to protect against attacks.

8. The current IDS only addresses CAN bus networks. Discuss how you would extend this approach to secure next-generation automotive Ethernet networks. What additional capabilities would be required?

9. Analyze the security considerations in directly connecting the IDS accelerator to the CAN controller versus monitoring network traffic through the main processor. What are the tradeoffs?

10. The paper reports peak resource utilization for the IDS accelerator on the FPGA. Discuss how partial reconfiguration could be used to virtulize the FPGA resources between the IDS and other ECU functionality.
