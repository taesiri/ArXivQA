# [Recursive Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09300)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Causal discovery, i.e. learning causal relationships from observational data, is fundamental for making inferences and decisions in science and policymaking. However, it faces two key challenges:
1) Limited data results in errors when testing for conditional independencies using statistical methods. 
2) The computational complexity for searching through the combinatorially large space of graphs is extremely high, making it intractable for larger problems.

Proposed Solution:
This paper develops a unified framework for recursive causal discovery by building upon four previous publications by the authors. The key idea is to strategically identify "removable" variables, learn their neighbors, eliminate them from the variable set, and recursively learn the causal structure over the remaining variables. This iterative removal of variables leads to smaller problems in each recursion, requiring fewer conditional independence (CI) tests with smaller conditioning sets. Consequently, this enhances computational efficiency and statistical reliability.

The paper establishes theoretical results on properties of removable variables, provides efficient algorithms to identify them, and analyzes the complexity of the proposed methods. Four specific algorithms are presented: 
1) MARVEL: Recursive method under causal sufficiency 
2) L-MARVEL: Extension to handle latent variables
3) RSL: Recursive method exploiting structural assumptions 
4) ROL: Ordering-based method without causal sufficiency 

Additionally, the paper introduces RCD, an open-source Python package implementing these recursive algorithms.

Main Contributions:
1) Unified framework for recursive causal discovery providing enhanced efficiency
2) Theoretical results on removable variables and fundamental limits of constraint-based methods 
3) Four recursive algorithms with different assumptions and polynomial-time complexity
4) RCD package enabling accessible implementation of proposed methods
5) Complexity analysis demonstrating order-optimal performance relative to information-theoretic lower bounds

In summary, this paper establishes a principled approach for recursive causal discovery that significantly advances the state of the art in efficiency and accessibility of methods for this fundamental problem. The theoretical and empirical analysis provides insights into the fundamental limits and practical performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a unified framework for recursive causal discovery by iteratively identifying removable variables, learning their neighbors, eliminating them from the data, and recursively learning the causal structure over the remaining variables to reduce computational complexity and improve statistical reliability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a unified framework for recursive causal discovery methods, building upon the authors' previous work in this area. The main contributions include:

1) Introducing the concept of "removable" variables, which allows reducing the problem size iteratively by removing certain variables and learning the causal graph over the remaining variables. This significantly reduces the number of conditional independence tests required.

2) Providing a generic algorithmic framework, graphical characterizations, and key properties for identifying and removing such removable variables under different assumptions. 

3) Proposing four recursive causal discovery algorithms: MARVEL, L-MARVEL, RSL, and ROL that integrate removable variables differently. The paper analyzes completeness guarantees and computational complexities.

4) Establishing lower bounds that demonstrate the near-optimality of the proposed methods.

5) Launching an efficient Python package called RCD that implements these recursive algorithms and provides modular, well-documented, and optimized code for practitioners.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive framework and toolset enabling more statistically reliable and computationally efficient causal discovery through a recursive approach centered around removable variables. The theoretical analysis alongside the software package is the key novelty.

The paper introduces the concept of "removable variables", which allow recursive approaches to causal discovery that successively reduce the problem size. This helps address challenges related to computational complexity and statistical errors. The proposed methods leverage Markov boundary information and conditional independence tests within a constraint-based framework to recursively identify removable variables, learn their neighbors, and reduce the set of variables for further discovery. Both DAGs and MAGs are handled to accommodate latent variables. Completeness guarantees, complexity analysis, comparisons to other methods, and introduction of the RCD Python package for applying these techniques are also provided. The keywords cover the main topics and contributions discussed in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the recursive causal discovery methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "removable" variables. Explain what a removable variable is, and discuss why identifying and eliminating removable variables is crucial for the recursive framework to correctly learn the causal graph.

2. The paper provides graphical characterizations for removable variables in both DAGs (Theorem 3) and MAGs (Theorem 4). Discuss these characterizations in detail and explain how they allow one to verify if a variable is removable by only using the Markov boundary.

3. The paper argues removable variables have relatively small Markov boundary sizes (Proposition 5). Elaborate on why this is an important property and how Algorithm 2 leverages this to efficiently find removable variables.

4. Proposition 6 states removable variables are invariant in a Markov equivalence class. Explain why this property is pivotal for the proposed recursive framework and ordering-based methods like ROL.

5. The paper defines removable orders (r-orders) and shows they include causal orders (c-orders) as a subset (Proposition 8). Discuss the advantages of using r-orders over c-orders for structure learning.

6. The paper provides two fundamental lower bound theorems (Theorems 12 and 13) on the complexity of constraint-based methods. Explain the significance of these results and how the complexity of the proposed algorithms compare.

7. The paper introduces the RCD Python package for implementing the proposed methods. Discuss the package's key features and architecture that make it easy to use for practitioners.

8. Compare the assumptions, guarantees, and complexity between MARVEL, L-MARVEL, RSL, and ROL. What are the trade-offs between these algorithms?

9. Theorems 7 and 9 provide methods to verify if a variable is removable in RSL$_\omega$  and RSL$_D$, respectively. Elaborate on these theorems and discuss how they lead to efficient procedures.

10. Proposition 16 states RSL$_\omega$ is "verifiable" even when given an invalid upper bound on the clique number. Explain what this means and how Algorithm 5 leverages this property.
