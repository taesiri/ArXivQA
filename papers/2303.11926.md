# [Exploring Object-Centric Temporal Modeling for Efficient Multi-View 3D   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11926)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method for efficient long-sequence multi-view 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. The key research question is how to effectively incorporate temporal information across frames to improve 3D detection performance, while maintaining high computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications. The main hypothesis is that propagating temporal information through object queries can achieve strong performance on modeling object motions and long-term dependencies, without introducing much computational overhead compared to single-frame detection. Specifically, the paper explores an "object-centric" paradigm that uses sparse object queries as intermediate states to propagate information across frames. The key contributions and innovations include:- Introducing a new object-centric temporal modeling paradigm that propagates temporal information via object queries instead of dense feature maps. This allows efficient long-term modeling.- Designing an end-to-end framework "StreamPETR" based on this idea, with components like a memory queue and propagation transformer.- Achieving state-of-the-art multi-view 3D detection performance on nuScenes dataset, while having high efficiency comparable to single-frame methods.- Demonstrating the generalizability of this object-centric temporal modeling idea by applying it to other architectures like DETR3D.In summary, the core hypothesis is that object-centric temporal modeling can unlock efficient and effective long-sequence 3D detection, which is empirically verified through strong results on public benchmarks.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes StreamPETR, an object-centric temporal modeling framework for efficient multi-view 3D object detection in streaming video. The model performs detection frame by frame in an online manner, propagating long-term information via object queries stored in a memory queue. Specifically, the historical object queries are aligned to the current frame and interacted with current queries and image features through a propagation transformer module.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes StreamPETR, a long-sequence multi-view 3D object detection framework. The key idea is to develop an object-centric temporal modeling mechanism to propagate historical information efficiently through object queries frame-by-frame. Specifically, a memory queue is used to store historical object queries, including context embeddings, 3D centers, velocities etc. At each time step, the current object queries interact with historical queries in the memory queue through a propagation transformer to obtain temporal information. A motion-aware layer normalization is introduced in the propagation transformer to model the movements of objects implicitly. After interaction, the updated object queries are used to generate 3D boxes and top-K foreground queries are pushed into the memory queue. Through this recurrent update, long-term temporal information can be propagated efficiently.Experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate that StreamPETR significantly improves the performance over strong baselines with negligible extra computation cost. It achieves state-of-the-art results among online multi-view methods and is the first to match the performance of lidar-based methods. The object-centric temporal modeling provides an effective and efficient paradigm for streaming perception.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes StreamPETR, an object-centric temporal modeling framework for efficient multi-view 3D object detection in streaming video. The key problem it aims to address is how to effectively incorporate temporal information across frames to improve 3D object detection performance, while keeping the model efficient for online streaming video input.Existing methods either warp bird's eye view (BEV) features across frames, which struggles with modeling moving objects, or perform expensive cross-attention between object queries and multi-frame image features, which is computationally costly.To address these issues, StreamPETR explores propagating temporal information through object queries frame-by-frame.
