# [Exploring Object-Centric Temporal Modeling for Efficient Multi-View 3D   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11926)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new method for efficient long-sequence multi-view 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. The key research question is how to effectively incorporate temporal information across frames to improve 3D detection performance, while maintaining high computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications. The main hypothesis is that propagating temporal information through object queries can achieve strong performance on modeling object motions and long-term dependencies, without introducing much computational overhead compared to single-frame detection. Specifically, the paper explores an "object-centric" paradigm that uses sparse object queries as intermediate states to propagate information across frames. The key contributions and innovations include:- Introducing a new object-centric temporal modeling paradigm that propagates temporal information via object queries instead of dense feature maps. This allows efficient long-term modeling.- Designing an end-to-end framework "StreamPETR" based on this idea, with components like a memory queue and propagation transformer.- Achieving state-of-the-art multi-view 3D detection performance on nuScenes dataset, while having high efficiency comparable to single-frame methods.- Demonstrating the generalizability of this object-centric temporal modeling idea by applying it to other architectures like DETR3D.In summary, the core hypothesis is that object-centric temporal modeling can unlock efficient and effective long-sequence 3D detection, which is empirically verified through strong results on public benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces StreamPETR, a framework for efficient long-sequence modeling in multi-view 3D object detection. The key contributions are:- It proposes an object-centric temporal modeling paradigm. Unlike previous methods that propagate temporal information through dense BEV or image features, StreamPETR uses sparse object queries as the intermediate representation for temporal modeling. This allows efficiently propagating long-term temporal information frame-by-frame.- It develops an object-centric temporal modeling framework called StreamPETR. It utilizes a memory queue to store historical object queries. A propagation transformer operates on the current queries and historical queries from the memory to simultaneously model object motion and build long-term spatial-temporal interactions. - It introduces a motion-aware layer normalization module to implicitly encode motion information like ego-motion and object velocities into the object queries. This helps to model the movement of objects.- Experiments show StreamPETR significantly improves performance over strong baselines on nuScenes dataset, with negligible computational overhead. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among online multi-view methods. The lightweight version runs at 31.7 FPS with 45.0 mAP.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the object-centric paradigm for efficient long-sequence modeling in multi-view 3D detection. StreamPETR develops an effective framework instantiating this idea and demonstrates its effectiveness.
