# [Run LoRA Run: Faster and Lighter LoRA Implementations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03415)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents RunLoRA, a framework for efficient implementations of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) that can significantly improve the speed and reduce memory usage of neural network training and fine-tuning using low-rank adapters. The proposed implementation optimizes the computation graph of LoRA operations based on the dimensions of the linear layer, layer input, and lora rank, choosing the best forward and backward passes to minimize FLOPs and time while maintaining accuracy. Experiments on the Llama family of large language models with up to 1.3 billion parameters demonstrate speedups of up to 17% compared to default LoRA implementations, as well as memory savings of up to 4GB due to reducing the number of saved activations. The authors note quantization of weights as a promising future direction to evaluate RunLoRA on even larger models and batch sizes, expecting greater performance improvements. In summary, RunLoRA provides an optimized and efficient way to leverage the benefits of LoRA for reduced-cost tuning and training of large neural network models.
