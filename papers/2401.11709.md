## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Skull base surgery is extremely challenging as surgeons must operate in tight spaces around critical anatomical structures like nerves and blood vessels. This demands tremendous precision and extensive training.
- There is a need for advanced computer and robotic assistance to enhance safety and efficiency in skull base procedures. Specifically, providing real-time haptic feedback can greatly aid surgeons in safely navigating intricate anatomy.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a collaborative robot framework enriched with safety-driven haptic assistance for skull base drilling procedures. 
- An interactive simulation model of the anatomy and robot is used to compute forces guiding the drill away from critical structures based on the distance to those structures.
- These forces provide haptic feedback through the robot's admittance controller to steer the surgeon's motions. The forces increase exponentially as the drill nears anatomy.
- Patient-specific anatomical models and constraints are derived from medical imaging to provide customized assistance.

Key Contributions:
- Development of a comprehensive system spanning from preoperative planning to intraoperative haptic-assisted robotic collaboration.
- Seamless integration of a dynamic simulation model with a cooperative robot to enable real-time haptic guidance virtual fixtures.  
- Design of a haptic assistance approach using signed distance fields from patient anatomy for progressive guidance.
- Demonstration of feasibility and safety enhancement with phantom and cadaver experiments involving both novice and expert surgeons.

In summary, the proposed collaborative robotic framework aims to improve surgical situational awareness and precision in complex skull base procedures via patient-specific haptic assistance. Initial results highlight the promise of this approach for integrating robotic collaboration in demanding surgical scenarios.
