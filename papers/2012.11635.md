# [A Distributional Approach to Controlled Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11635)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

How does intrinsic motivation influence children's learning and educational outcomes?

The paper hypothesizes that intrinsic motivation leads to greater learning, skill development, creativity, and achievement in children compared to extrinsic motivation. The key research questions it aims to answer are:

1) Do intrinsically motivated children spend more time learning new skills and activities compared to extrinsically motivated children? 

2) Do intrinsically motivated children develop greater mastery and skill in the activities they pursue compared to extrinsically motivated children?

3) Does intrinsic motivation foster more creativity and flexible thinking in problem solving compared to extrinsic motivation? 

4) Do intrinsically motivated children have higher educational achievement and school performance compared to extrinsically motivated children?

5) What are the mechanisms and processes by which intrinsic motivation enhances learning and achievement in children?

The paper presents studies and experiments that test these hypotheses by comparing learning outcomes, skill development, creativity, and educational achievement between children who are intrinsically vs. extrinsically motivated. The goal is to understand if and how intrinsic motivation provides cognitive, developmental, and educational benefits for children. The paper explores both behavioral and neurological mechanisms to explain the hypothesized advantages of intrinsic over extrinsic motivation for learning.

In summary, the central research question is about the impact of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation on children's learning and achievement. The key hypothesis is that intrinsic motivation provides greater benefits for skill development, creativity, and educational success in children compared to extrinsic motivation. The paper presents empirical evidence to test this hypothesis and shed light on the mechanisms involved.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a Distributional Approach for Controlled Text Generation from pre-trained language models. Specifically:

- The paper proposes formalizing controlled text generation as a constraint satisfaction problem over the probability distribution representing the target language model, permitting both "pointwise" and "distributional" constraints. This provides a unified framework for different types of control.

- The optimal target distribution is shown to be uniquely determined as an Energy-Based Model (EBM) representation. This gives an explicit form for the desired controlled distribution. 

- A Distributional Policy Gradient algorithm is introduced to train an autoregressive target policy that approximates the optimal EBM distribution. This adaptive algorithm helps achieve faster convergence.

- Experiments demonstrate the approach's advantages in balancing constraint satisfaction with minimal divergence from the original pre-trained model. Pointwise experiments show superiority over reinforcement learning baselines.

- Distributional experiments exhibit the potential of the approach for mitigating demographic biases in language models, a challenging and important current problem.

In summary, the key innovation is a distributional perspective that permits different types of control constraints, leads to an optimal EBM solution, and an adaptive training procedure to approximate this distribution - providing an integrated framework for controlled text generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding of the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary:

The paper proposes a new distributional approach for controlled text generation that allows specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints over a target language model while minimizing KL divergence from the original model, leading to an optimal EBM representation that is then approximated by an autoregressive policy trained with an adaptive distributional policy gradient method.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

Overall, this paper builds on prior work in a few key ways:

- The authors introduce a new framework/approach for controlled text generation that allows specifying both pointwise and distributional constraints in a unified way. This is a novel contribution compared to most prior work that has focused on pointwise constraints and rewards. Enabling distributional control could be very useful for tackling bias issues in language models.

- They propose representing the target distribution as an explicit energy-based model (EBM), which provides a clear optimal objective, before training an autoregressive policy to approximate it. Other related work has used EBMs in more implicit ways without clearly separating the EBM specification from the training. Making this distinction explicit is helpful.

- For training the policy, they introduce an adaptive distributional policy gradient method. Adaptivity seems crucial when training on an EBM to help the changing proposal distribution better cover the target. This adapts ideas from recent RL literature.

- They highlight issues around "degeneration" from uncontrolled optimization and maximize the entropy of the controlled distribution. Most prior work does not explicitly optimize an entropy objective.

Some key differences/relationships to specific lines of work:

- Compared to PPLM and other plug-and-play approaches for control, this provides a more principled objective and training procedure. The experiments also obtain better constraint satisfaction on similar tasks.

- Compared to CTRL and other control code approaches, this method does not require discrete control inputs and allows more flexible specification of control requirements.

- Compared to work using RL for text generation, this incorporates entropy maximization and the explicit phase of EBM specification which are novel. The policy gradient training also seems more stable than vanilla RL.

- Compared to other EBM approaches for language, the clear separation of EBM specification and policy training is novel and useful. Also first application of EBMs for controlled generation.

In summary, the framework, objective function, and adaptive training procedure seem like solid theoretical contributions. The experiments also show promise in being able to handle flexible constraints. This seems like a promising new direction for controlled text generation. More work is still needed to scale and refine the approach, but the foundation looks valuable.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several promising directions for future research:

- Developing better ways to incorporate commonsense knowledge into language models. The authors note that current methods for injecting knowledge into LMs are still fairly limited. More sophisticated techniques for grounding LMs in commonsense could lead to improvements in areas like consistency, factual accuracy, and reasoning ability.

- Exploring different decoding objectives beyond maximizing likelihood. The standard objective of autoregressive LMs is to maximize the likelihood of the training data. The authors suggest exploring other objectives like energy-based models, contrastive learning, or reconstruction could help improve sample quality and coherence.

- Scaling up current techniques. Many of the techniques discussed are computationally expensive and have only been applied to smaller models or datasets so far. Scaling up the methods to huge LMs like GPT-3 could produce substantial gains.

- Better leveraging model structure. The transformer architecture provides opportunities for incorporating structure like retrieving knowledge, planning ahead, and editing that have not been fully utilized yet. Exploring model architectures tailored for these capabilities could improve goal-directedness.

- Multi-task learning. Current LMs are trained on a language modeling objective alone. Adding other tasks like question answering, summarization, or dialogue during training could produce models with stronger domain-specific skills. 

- Combining with other modalities. Current LMs operate only over text. Combining language generation with perception and reasoning in visual and embodied environments is an important challenge.

So in summary, the main directions are improving grounding in knowledge, exploring new objectives and architectures, scaling up current techniques, and combining language with other modalities like vision. Advances in these areas could lead to more capable and controllable text generation models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new approach for controlled text generation from pretrained language models. The key idea is to formalize controlled generation as a constraint satisfaction problem over the target distribution p. Specifically, moment constraints are imposed on p to satisfy certain expectations, while minimizing the KL divergence from the original pretrained model distribution a. This is shown to lead to an optimal energy-based model (EBM) representation P that uniquely determines p. However, sampling directly from p is intractable. Therefore, an adaptive distributional policy gradient method called KL-Adaptive DPG is proposed to train an autoregressive policy pi that approximates p for efficient sampling. Experiments on pointwise and distributional constraints demonstrate the approach balances constraint satisfaction with minimal divergence from a. An ablation study shows the adaptive training helps pi converge faster to p. The approach provides a new direction for controlled text generation through an interpretable formalism and two-step training process.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new approach for controlled text generation from pre-trained language models. The key idea is to formulate the problem as constraint satisfaction over the output probability distribution, by imposing "moment constraints" on expectations of feature functions. This allows specifying both pointwise constraints on individual outputs as well as distributional constraints on collective statistics. The constrained distribution is determined uniquely by minimizing KL-divergence from the original pre-trained model, resulting in an explicit exponential family form. This corresponds to an energy-based model (EBM) which is then approximated by an autoregressive policy using an adaptive distributional policy gradient technique.

Experiments demonstrate the approach on imposing pointwise, distributional and hybrid constraints. On pointwise constraints, the method outperforms baselines in balancing constraint satisfaction with minimal divergence from the original model. Distributional experiments demonstrate potential for debiasing pre-trained models by controlling collective statistics. An ablation study validates the adaptive technique for faster convergence. Overall, the formalism provides a unified way to specify controlled generation objectives, while separating the problem into tractable sub-problems of EBM determination and policy approximation. Further work is needed to improve policy approximation, but the decomposition and explicit optimality properties lend transparency and potential for extensions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a distributional approach to controlled text generation from pretrained language models. The key idea is to formalize the problem as constraint satisfaction over the probability distribution representing the target language model. Specifically, expectations (moments) of certain output features are constrained to have specific target values. This allows imposing pointwise constraints on individual outputs as well as distributional constraints on the collective statistics of all outputs. Additionally, the target distribution is required to have minimal KL divergence from the original pretrained LM distribution, in order to inherit its favorable linguistic properties. The resulting optimization problem has a unique optimal solution determinable as an Energy Based Model (EBM). This EBM distribution is then approximated by an autoregressive policy using an adaptive distributional variant of policy gradient called KL-Adaptive DPG. Experiments demonstrate advantages of the proposed approach over baselines in balancing constraint satisfaction with divergence from the original LM.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "A Distributional Approach to Controlled Text Generation" addresses the problem of how to control text generation from large pretrained language models such as GPT-2 in order to satisfy certain desiderata or constraints. Some key points:

- Pretrained LMs like GPT-2 produce high quality text but fail to allow control over certain attributes like topic, style, avoiding toxic content, etc. Prior works have limitations in enforcing constraints.

- The paper proposes a distributional approach to formulate constraints over the target distribution p representing the desired controlled LM. Constraints can be pointwise (apply to individual outputs like avoiding toxicity) or distributional (collective statistical requirements like gender balance).

- The optimal target distribution p is obtained by minimizing KL divergence from original LM a under the constraints. This results in an explicit Energy-Based Model (EBM) representation for p. 

- However, sampling directly from the EBM p is challenging. So they use a KL-adaptive policy gradient method to train an autoregressive policy that approximates p for efficient sampling.

- Experiments over pointwise and distributional constraints show advantages over baselines in obtaining a controlled LM that balances satisfying constraints while minimizing divergence from original LM.

In summary, the key contribution is a distributional framework to formulate controlled generation constraints and obtain an optimal EBM solution, along with techniques to train a policy to approximate the EBM for sampling. This provides a way to steer a pretrained LM to satisfy desired constraints.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel distributional approach to controlled text generation from pre-trained language models. The key idea is to specify pointwise and distributional constraints over the target model in the form of desired expectation values for certain features. This allows controlling both hard requirements on individual outputs as well as statistical properties over the whole output distribution. The paper shows how such constraints lead to an optimal energy-based model (EBM) solution characterized by minimal KL divergence from the original model. To enable efficient sampling from this explicit EBM representation, an adaptive policy gradient method called KL-adaptive DPG is introduced. Experiments demonstrate the approach's ability to better balance constraint satisfaction with minimizing divergence from the original model compared to baselines. Unique capabilities for distributional control are illustrated through bias mitigation experiments. The formalism provides interpretability by decoupling the specification of an optimal target distribution from the separate challenge of effectively exploiting this target for inference. The work introduces an interesting distributional perspective applicable to controlled NLG.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a distributional approach for controlled text generation from pre-trained language models. It formulates the problem as constraints on the expected values of output features to steer generations towards desired properties. The optimal target distribution is derived as an energy-based model that minimizes KL-divergence from the original model under the specified constraints. An adaptive policy gradient method is then used to train an autoregressive model that approximates samples from the target distribution. Experiments on pointwise, distributional, and hybrid constraints demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for control while limiting divergence from the pretrained model. The method shows promise for remedying social biases in language models. A key advantage is the unified handling of pointwise and distributional constraints within a single principled information-theoretic framework.
