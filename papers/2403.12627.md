# [Enhancing Formal Theorem Proving: A Comprehensive Dataset for Training   AI Models on Coq Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12627)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in processing and generating specialized syntax like that of the Coq proof assistant. There is a lack of tailored datasets to enhance LLMs' capabilities for interpreting and producing valid Coq code.

- This hinders progress in using LLMs to assist with formal theorem proving and verification of mathematical and computational propositions.

Solution:
- The paper introduces a comprehensive dataset specifically designed to improve LLMs' proficiency with Coq code. 

- The dataset contains over 100,000 facts (definitions/notations) and over 160,000 propositions alongside their proofs, extracted and preprocessed from 10,000+ high-quality Coq source files.

- Metadata is provided including imports, filenames, licensing details and source code refs for reproducibility and proper licensing compliance.

Main Contributions:
- This is the first large-scale, properly-licensed dataset focused on enhancing LLMs for processing Coq syntax, semantics and proof strategies.

- Experiments showcase 141 valid proofs generated by a finetuned LLM for a basic lemma, highlighting the dataset's power to unlock diverse valid proof techniques.

- Careful sourcing and preprocessing facilitates models that can generate syntactically and logically coherent Coq constructs autonomously.

- The standardized format opens possibilities for agent-based systems and machine interaction with Coq codebases.

In summary, this paper makes available an expertly-constructed dataset to further the frontiers of AI in formal theorem proving. Initial experiments reveal promising results while detailed documentation enables reproducible research.
