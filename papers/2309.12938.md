# [Frustrated with Code Quality Issues? LLMs can Help!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can large language models (LLMs) be effectively used to assist developers in revising source code to resolve code quality issues flagged by static analysis tools?

The key hypothesis appears to be that by using a suitable prompting strategy, LLMs can be instructed to generate candidate code revisions that resolve quality issues detected by static analysis tools. The revisions would be acceptable to both the tools (by construction) as well as developers (by using a second LLM as a ranker). This approach could help automate resolution of code quality issues with minimal engineering effort compared to existing techniques.

The paper presents a system called CORE that implements this idea using a proposer-ranker LLM duo. It conducts experiments on Python and Java benchmarks with CodeQL and SonarQube tools to evaluate the ability of CORE to:

1) Generate acceptable code revisions 
2) Reduce false positives 
3) Generalize across languages, tools and checks
4) Achieve comparable fix rates to a specialized program repair tool

The results appear to validate the hypothesis, demonstrating the promise of using LLMs to assist developers in improving code quality with minimal configuration overhead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Identifying the opportunity of using large language models (LLMs) that can follow natural language instructions to assist developers in resolving code quality issues flagged by static analysis tools. 

2. Presenting a system called CORE (COde REvisions) that is built using a duo of LLMs - a proposer LLM that generates candidate revisions following fix recommendations, and a ranker LLM that scores the revisions to filter out unintended changes.

3. Conducting extensive experiments on two public benchmarks in Python and Java using 52 and 10 quality checks from CodeQL and SonarQube tools respectively. The results demonstrate CORE's ability to generate acceptable revisions, reduce false positives, generalize across languages/tools, and achieve comparable fix rates to a specialized program repair tool.

4. Releasing the code and data to facilitate further research in this direction of using LLMs to help improve code quality.

In summary, the main contribution is leveraging the instruction following abilities of LLMs to assist developers in resolving code quality issues flagged during static analysis. The paper presents a system CORE to realize this goal and provides comprehensive empirical evidence of its promise.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a system called CORE that uses large language models to help developers improve code quality by proposing and ranking revisions that resolve issues flagged by static analysis tools.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work in using large language models (LLMs) for automated program repair:

- Main contribution: The paper presents a new system called CORE that uses a pair of LLMs (a proposer and a ranker) to generate candidate fixes for code quality issues detected by static analysis tools. It shows the promise of this approach on two benchmarks with quality checks from CodeQL and SonarQube tools. 

- Novelty: The key novelty is in using LLMs for repair in a zero-shot setting, without requiring bug-fix training data or finetuning. LLMs are instructed using documentation and natural language recommendations from tool providers. The ranker LLM provides a method to filter candidate fixes.

- Related work: Many existing automated repair techniques require bug-fix training data or hand-crafted rules. Recent works have started exploring LLMs but mainly target bugs with failing tests. They rely on finetuning or need bug-fix examples during prompting. CORE targets quality issues found by static analysis without examples. The ranker LLM is also a distinguishing aspect.

- Results: CORE is able to fix 60-80% of files on the benchmarks. The ranker LLM substantially reduces false positives. The techniques generalize across languages, tools and checks. CORE achieves comparable fix rate to a specialized tool Solard but with much less engineering effort.

- Limitations: The evaluation relies primarily on static analysis, with limited human evaluation. The quality issues tackled are less complex than general program repair. There is scope for improvement in the correctness of fixes.

In summary, this paper demonstrates a promising new application of LLMs for automated repair of quality issues, using a novel zero-shot prompting and dual LLM approach. The results are very encouraging but more work is needed to handle more complex repairs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Expand scope of CORE system to support more static analysis tools, programming languages, and code quality checks. The authors mention building more components in the pipeline to handle additional tools, checks etc. 

- Improve quality and correctness of generated fixes using feedback-driven techniques. The authors suggest using traditional static and dynamic analysis techniques to automatically generate feedback, as well as leveraging recent advances in finetuning LLMs using reinforcement learning and human feedback.

- Enhance prompting techniques, especially for the ranker LLM, to further reduce false positives and developer burden. 

- Evaluate CORE on larger benchmarks and conduct more user studies to assess developer acceptance of fixes in practice.

- Investigate alternative LLM configurations as the proposer and ranker, and study their impact.

- Explore potential of conversational approach where developer can interact with CORE to iteratively improve fixes.

- Combine CORE with existing program repair techniques like template-based transformation or data-driven methods to synthesize an even broader range of fixes.

- Package CORE as usable tool for developers and study its adoption in real software engineering workflows.

In summary, the key directions are around expanding scope, improving quality of fixes, enhancing prompting techniques, more comprehensive evaluation, exploring alternative LLMs, conversational interaction, integration with other repair methods, and transitioning CORE into a practical developer tool.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a system called CORE (COde REvisions) that uses large language models (LLMs) to help developers resolve code quality issues identified by static analysis tools. The system is comprised of two LLMs - a "proposer" LLM that generates candidate code revisions based on natural language instructions, and a "ranker" LLM that scores the revisions to filter out incorrect ones before presenting them to the developer. 

The authors evaluate CORE on Python and Java code quality benchmarks using CodeQL and SonarQube static analysis tools. The results show that CORE can generate acceptable code revisions for the majority of files, comparable to a state-of-the-art program repair tool but with much less engineering effort.

The authors conclude that CORE shows promise in using LLMs to assist developers in improving code quality with minimal effort.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a system called CORE (COde REvisions) that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically revise source code to fix code quality issues identified by static analysis tools. CORE uses a pipeline with two LLMs - a "proposer" LLM that generates candidate code fixes when prompted with the code quality issue description and affected code snippet, and a "ranker" LLM that scores the proposed fixes to filter out incorrect revisions. The proposer LLM is given the code quality check details and fix recommendations from documentation, along with the flagged code, to generate candidate revisions. These are filtered by running the static analysis, then ranked by the ranker LLM using a rubric prompting it to score based on correctness of the fix and avoiding unrelated changes. The approach is evaluated on Python and Java code benchmarks using CodeQL and SonarQube static analysis tools, showing the ability of CORE to produce acceptable fixes comparable to a specialized program repair tool but with much less engineering effort. Human evaluation also shows the ranker LLM is effective at reducing false positives compared to just using the static analysis output.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of improving code quality by automatically revising code to fix issues flagged by static analysis tools. The key questions it investigates are:

- How effective are large language models (LLMs) at generating acceptable code revisions that resolve quality issues identified by static analysis tools? 

- Can a system using LLMs generalize across programming languages, quality checks, and static analysis tools?
