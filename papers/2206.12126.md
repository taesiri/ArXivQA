# [Temporal Attention Unit: Towards Efficient Spatiotemporal Predictive   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12126)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper aims to develop an efficient spatiotemporal predictive learning method without using recurrent neural networks. The key hypothesis is that an attention-based temporal module can replace recurrent units to achieve competitive performance for future frame prediction.

- The paper proposes a Temporal Attention Unit (TAU) to model temporal evolutions in videos. TAU employs both intra-frame statical attention and inter-frame dynamical attention to capture long-term dependencies. 

- A differential divergence regularization is introduced to optimize the prediction by considering both intra-frame and inter-frame differences.

- Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed attention-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing recurrent-based methods, while requiring much lower computational cost.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the commonly used recurrent structures for temporal modeling in video prediction can be replaced by efficient attention modules without sacrificing performance. The key contributions are the proposed TAU and the differential divergence regularization for accurate and efficient spatiotemporal predictive learning.
