# [Learning a More Continuous Zero Level Set in Unsigned Distance Fields   through Level Set Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11441)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn a more continuous and accurate zero level set in unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to improve 3D shape representation and applications?The key points are:- The zero level set of UDF indicates the surface location, but neural networks struggle to learn an accurate and smooth zero level set where the UDF is non-differentiable. This leads to fragmentation and discontinuities. - The authors propose two novel constraints to achieve a more continuous zero level set:1) Level set projection: Pull non-zero level sets onto the zero level set using gradient alignment to guide optimization. 2) Unsigned distance loss: Explicitly optimize unsigned distances at input points.- More accurate zero level set improves surface reconstruction, unsupervised normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling.- Experiments show improved accuracy and continuity compared to state-of-the-art on various datasets. In summary, the core hypothesis is that constraints on the zero level set of UDFs can lead to improved representation and performance on 3D tasks requiring accurate and smooth surfaces. The experiments aim to demonstrate these benefits.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes novel constraints to achieve a more continuous zero level set in unsigned distance functions by projecting convincing non-zero level sets onto the unreliable zero level set to guide optimization, enabling representation of complex 3D geometries and improved performance on downstream tasks like surface reconstruction, unsupervised point normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in learning neural implicit representations:- This paper focuses specifically on learning unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to represent shapes and scenes with arbitrary topology. Other related work has explored signed distance functions (SDFs), occupancy functions, or view-dependent radiance fields. UDFs are more flexible than SDFs/occupancy for open surfaces.- A core contribution is developing constraints to learn a more accurate and continuous zero level set in the UDF. Many previous methods struggle to learn sharp and consistent zero level sets, leading to poor surface reconstructions. The proposed level set projection and other losses help overcome this limitation.- The applications explored like surface reconstruction, point upsampling, and normal estimation are not novel, but performance is superior to other recent unsupervised methods by virtue of the improved UDF representation.- Compared to prior work on learning UDFs like NDF or CAP-UDF, the proposed method achieves much smoother and detailed surface reconstructions thanks to the more accurate zero level set learning.- For surface reconstruction, it compares favorably to classic learning methods like ConvONet or OccNet that rely on occupancy functions for closed shapes. The UDF representation is more flexible.- Unlike some prior work that trains on large shape datasets, this method learns UDFs directly from single raw point clouds in an unsupervised way, demonstrating generalization.In summary, the key novelty is in developing unsupervised constraints to learn continuous and accurate zero level sets in UDFs, leading to state-of-the-art performance on tasks relying on implicit neural representations. The zero level set learning could likely transfer to other applications as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring other applications of the learned UDF with accurate zero level set, beyond the three applications presented in the paper (surface reconstruction, point normal estimation, point upsampling). The authors state the accurate zero level set is a key factor for representing complex geometries and supporting downstream 3D applications, so they suggest exploring additional applications that could benefit from their approach.- Extending the method to learn dynamic scenes and 4D representations. The current method focuses on reconstructing static 3D shapes and scenes. The authors suggest extending it to model dynamic scenes and changes over time as an interesting direction.- Combining learning-based surface reconstruction with traditional optimization-based methods. The authors mention combining the power of learning and traditional optimization as a promising direction. For example, using their learned UDF to initialize and guide optimization-based surface reconstruction.  - Exploring self-supervised techniques to avoid requiring raw point clouds as input. The current method requires raw point clouds during training. Developing techniques to train on only images or other supervision is suggested.- Generalizing the framework to directly output meshes rather than implicit representations. The authors suggest extending the method to learn to generate explicit mesh representations.- Handling larger scenes by exploring techniques like hierarchical representations. The experiments focus on object and room-scale scenes. Scaling to large environments like cities could benefit from hierarchical or part-based representations.In summary, the main future directions relate to extending the applications, inputs, outputs, and scalability of the proposed UDF learning approach with accurate zero level sets. Exploring combinations with optimization methods and self-supervision are also highlighted as interesting avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a method to learn a more continuous zero level set in unsigned distance fields (UDFs) representing 3D shapes. The key idea is to leverage the more reliable non-zero level sets of the UDF to guide optimization of the less reliable zero level set via gradient alignment and distance correction. This is based on the observation that neural networks struggle to learn the non-differentiable zero level set of UDFs, leading to discontinuities. Two main constraints are introduced: 1) a level set projection loss that aligns gradients of a query point and its projection onto the zero level set, and 2) an unsigned distance loss that minimizes distances at raw input points. Experiments on shape and scene reconstruction, unsupervised normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling demonstrate improved continuity in the zero level set and downstream task performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The overall contribution is a technique to achieve smoother, more accurate zero level sets in learned implicit functions without ground truth supervision.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a method to learn a more continuous zero level set in unsigned distance fields (UDFs) for representing 3D shapes. UDFs are useful for representing shapes with complex topologies, but learning the zero level set indicating the surface location is challenging since it is non-differentiable. The key idea is to leverage the more reliable non-zero level sets to guide optimization of the zero level set. Two main constraints are introduced: 1) A level set projection loss that encourages gradient alignment between a query point and its projection onto the zero level set. This helps propagate gradient information from non-zero to zero level sets. 2) A gradient-surface orthogonal loss that regularizes the non-zero level set gradients to be orthogonal to the surface. This provides more accurate guidance for the zero level set.The improved UDF representation is applied to three tasks: surface reconstruction, unsupervised point normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling. Comparisons to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness. The constraints yield smoother and more continuous surfaces, improved normal estimations, and higher quality upsampled points. The results highlight the importance of an accurate zero level set in UDFs for representing shapes and performing 3D tasks. The unsupervised performance also shows the promise of learning geometries directly from raw point clouds without strong supervision.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a method to learn a more continuous zero level set in unsigned distance fields (UDFs) through level set projection. The key idea is to leverage the more reliable non-zero level sets of the UDF to guide the optimization of the unreliable zero level set. Specifically, two novel losses are proposed:1) Level Set Projection Loss: This loss enforces parallelism between the gradient at a query point and the gradient at its projection onto the zero level set. This helps align the gradients and correct distance errors on the zero level set. 2) Gradient-Surface Orthogonal Loss: This loss encourages the query point gradients to be orthogonal to the tangent plane of the surface. This helps learn more accurate non-zero level sets to better guide the zero level set optimization. An adaptive weighting strategy focuses the optimization nearer the zero level set. Experiments on surface reconstruction, point normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling demonstrate improved results over state-of-the-art methods.
