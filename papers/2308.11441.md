# [Learning a More Continuous Zero Level Set in Unsigned Distance Fields   through Level Set Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11441)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn a more continuous and accurate zero level set in unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to improve 3D shape representation and applications?The key points are:- The zero level set of UDF indicates the surface location, but neural networks struggle to learn an accurate and smooth zero level set where the UDF is non-differentiable. This leads to fragmentation and discontinuities. - The authors propose two novel constraints to achieve a more continuous zero level set:1) Level set projection: Pull non-zero level sets onto the zero level set using gradient alignment to guide optimization. 2) Unsigned distance loss: Explicitly optimize unsigned distances at input points.- More accurate zero level set improves surface reconstruction, unsupervised normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling.- Experiments show improved accuracy and continuity compared to state-of-the-art on various datasets. In summary, the core hypothesis is that constraints on the zero level set of UDFs can lead to improved representation and performance on 3D tasks requiring accurate and smooth surfaces. The experiments aim to demonstrate these benefits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing two novel constraints on unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to achieve a smoother and more continuous zero level set, without requiring ground truth unsigned distances. 2. The key insight is to leverage the more reliable non-zero level sets of the UDF to guide the optimization of the unreliable zero level set via gradient alignment and error correction.3. Demonstrating the importance of an accurate zero level set for effectively representing complex 3D geometries and supporting downstream 3D applications.4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3 different applications - surface reconstruction, unsupervised point normal estimation, and unsupervised point cloud upsampling.5. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons on shape and scene datasets, as well as real scans, to demonstrate the effectiveness over previous methods.In summary, the core idea is to propose constraints to achieve a better zero level set in unsigned distance fields, and show its benefits for 3D geometry representation and applications. The experiments justify the improvements over strong baselines.
