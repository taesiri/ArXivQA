# [Learning a More Continuous Zero Level Set in Unsigned Distance Fields   through Level Set Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11441)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn a more continuous and accurate zero level set in unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to improve 3D shape representation and applications?The key points are:- The zero level set of UDF indicates the surface location, but neural networks struggle to learn an accurate and smooth zero level set where the UDF is non-differentiable. This leads to fragmentation and discontinuities. - The authors propose two novel constraints to achieve a more continuous zero level set:1) Level set projection: Pull non-zero level sets onto the zero level set using gradient alignment to guide optimization. 2) Unsigned distance loss: Explicitly optimize unsigned distances at input points.- More accurate zero level set improves surface reconstruction, unsupervised normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling.- Experiments show improved accuracy and continuity compared to state-of-the-art on various datasets. In summary, the core hypothesis is that constraints on the zero level set of UDFs can lead to improved representation and performance on 3D tasks requiring accurate and smooth surfaces. The experiments aim to demonstrate these benefits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing two novel constraints on unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to achieve a smoother and more continuous zero level set, without requiring ground truth unsigned distances. 2. The key insight is to leverage the more reliable non-zero level sets of the UDF to guide the optimization of the unreliable zero level set via gradient alignment and error correction.3. Demonstrating the importance of an accurate zero level set for effectively representing complex 3D geometries and supporting downstream 3D applications.4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3 different applications - surface reconstruction, unsupervised point normal estimation, and unsupervised point cloud upsampling.5. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons on shape and scene datasets, as well as real scans, to demonstrate the effectiveness over previous methods.In summary, the core idea is to propose constraints to achieve a better zero level set in unsigned distance fields, and show its benefits for 3D geometry representation and applications. The experiments justify the improvements over strong baselines.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes novel constraints to achieve a more continuous zero level set in unsigned distance functions by projecting convincing non-zero level sets onto the unreliable zero level set to guide optimization, enabling representation of complex 3D geometries and improved performance on downstream tasks like surface reconstruction, unsupervised point normal estimation, and point cloud upsampling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in learning neural implicit representations:- This paper focuses specifically on learning unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to represent shapes and scenes with arbitrary topology. Other related work has explored signed distance functions (SDFs), occupancy functions, or view-dependent radiance fields. UDFs are more flexible than SDFs/occupancy for open surfaces.- A core contribution is developing constraints to learn a more accurate and continuous zero level set in the UDF. Many previous methods struggle to learn sharp and consistent zero level sets, leading to poor surface reconstructions. The proposed level set projection and other losses help overcome this limitation.- The applications explored like surface reconstruction, point upsampling, and normal estimation are not novel, but performance is superior to other recent unsupervised methods by virtue of the improved UDF representation.- Compared to prior work on learning UDFs like NDF or CAP-UDF, the proposed method achieves much smoother and detailed surface reconstructions thanks to the more accurate zero level set learning.- For surface reconstruction, it compares favorably to classic learning methods like ConvONet or OccNet that rely on occupancy functions for closed shapes. The UDF representation is more flexible.- Unlike some prior work that trains on large shape datasets, this method learns UDFs directly from single raw point clouds in an unsupervised way, demonstrating generalization.In summary, the key novelty is in developing unsupervised constraints to learn continuous and accurate zero level sets in UDFs, leading to state-of-the-art performance on tasks relying on implicit neural representations. The zero level set learning could likely transfer to other applications as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Exploring other applications of the learned UDF with accurate zero level set, beyond the three applications presented in the paper (surface reconstruction, point normal estimation, point upsampling). The authors state the accurate zero level set is a key factor for representing complex geometries and supporting downstream 3D applications, so they suggest exploring additional applications that could benefit from their approach.- Extending the method to learn dynamic scenes and 4D representations. The current method focuses on reconstructing static 3D shapes and scenes. The authors suggest extending it to model dynamic scenes and changes over time as an interesting direction.- Combining learning-based surface reconstruction with traditional optimization-based methods. The authors mention combining the power of learning and traditional optimization as a promising direction. For example, using their learned UDF to initialize and guide optimization-based surface reconstruction.  - Exploring self-supervised techniques to avoid requiring raw point clouds as input. The current method requires raw point clouds during training. Developing techniques to train on only images or other supervision is suggested.- Generalizing the framework to directly output meshes rather than implicit representations. The authors suggest extending the method to learn to generate explicit mesh representations.- Handling larger scenes by exploring techniques like hierarchical representations. The experiments focus on object and room-scale scenes. Scaling to large environments like cities could benefit from hierarchical or part-based representations.In summary, the main future directions relate to extending the applications, inputs, outputs, and scalability of the proposed UDF learning approach with accurate zero level sets. Exploring combinations with optimization methods and self-supervision are also highlighted as interesting avenues for future work.
