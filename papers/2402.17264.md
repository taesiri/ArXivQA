# [Explicit Interaction for Fusion-Based Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Fusion-based place recognition jointly utilizes multi-modal sensor data such as images and point clouds to recognize previously visited places for autonomous robots and vehicles. Existing methods combine the multi-modal features implicitly without considering what each modality explicitly contributes. As a result, the full potential of multi-modal fusion may not be reached.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes EINet, a novel fusion-based network to achieve explicit interaction between vision and LiDAR data. Specifically, it utilizes LiDAR ranges to supervise more robust vision features over long time spans. Meanwhile, it uses camera RGB data to improve the distinctiveness of LiDAR point clouds. This complementary interaction is achieved via:

1) Sparse depth supervision: LiDAR point clouds are projected to image planes to supervise pseudo depth map generation from images. This makes vision features geometry-aware. 

2) Appearance rendering: Camera RGB data is attached to LiDAR points to generate colored point clouds, making LiDAR features appearance-aware.

The interacted features are further fused by a cross-modal transformer to generate descriptors for place retrieval.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of EINet that achieves explicit and explainable interaction of vision and LiDAR data to leverage strengths of both modalities for place recognition.

2) Introduction of a new benchmark NUSC-PR with standardized training schemes and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research.

3) Extensive experiments showing EINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy and generalization ability across locations. The efficient inference also makes online deployment feasible.
