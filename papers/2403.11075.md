# [GOMA: Proactive Embodied Cooperative Communication via Goal-Oriented   Mental Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Verbal communication plays a crucial role in human cooperation when agents have incomplete information about the task, environment, and each other's mental states. 
- However, it remains challenging for robots to actively initiate concise yet meaningful communication grounded in the physical and social context to achieve effective cooperation with humans.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel cooperative communication framework called Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment (GOMA). 
- GOMA formulates communication as a planning problem - it optimizes communication to minimize the misalignment between the parts of agents' mental states that are relevant to achieving the goals.
- It enables an embodied AI assistant to reason about when and how to proactively initialize verbal communication with humans using natural language in order to facilitate better cooperation.

Key Ideas:
- Communication serves to align agents' goal-relevant beliefs by exchanging information.
- GOMA reasons if communication is needed by assessing divergence between joint plans based on the agent's own belief versus a hypothetical shared belief.
- It then optimizes communication using a proxy reward derived from the plan divergence. 
- This enables generating communication to minimize differences between the joint plans in each agent's mind and the true optimal joint plan.

Main Contributions:
- A new cooperative communication framework GOMA that allows an AI assistant to actively initiate verbal communication with humans grounded in the physical and social context.
- Extensive experiments in two challenging domains - multiplayer Overcooked game and household VirtualHome simulator, comparing GOMA with strong baselines.
- A human user study that evaluates the task performance of AI assistants enabled by different methods and humans' subjective perceptions of them.
