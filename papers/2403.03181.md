# [Behavior Generation with Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03181)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Behavior Generation with Latent Actions":

Problem: 
Generating complex behaviors from labeled datasets is challenging. Unlike language or images, decision-making requires modeling actions - continuous vectors that are multimodal, potentially from uncurated sources. Errors can compound over sequential predictions. Prior methods struggle to scale to high-dimensional actions, long sequences, or capture multi-modality.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformers (VQ-BeT) to address these challenges. VQ-BeT augments Behavior Transformers by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector quantization module based on Residual VQ-VAEs. This allows capturing multi-modal actions in a scalable discrete latent space.  

Main Contributions:

- VQ-BeT outperforms state-of-the-art conditional and unconditional behavior cloning methods in 5/7 simulated tasks. Gains are attributed to better capturing of multi-modality.

- On autonomous driving in nuScenes, VQ-BeT matches specialized state-of-the-art approaches in trajectory prediction despite using less information.

- In real-world robot manipulation, VQ-BeT improves on prior work by 73% on long-horizon tasks. Its single-pass design allows 5x faster simulation and 25x faster robot inference than multi-pass diffusion policies.

- VQ-BeT is versatile for both conditional and unconditional generation, partial observations, and scales to manipulation, locomotion and driving. Hierarchical vector quantization is critical for its performance.

In summary, VQ-BeT advances behavior modeling through a fast, scalable and versatile architecture that combines transformers and vector quantization to capture complexity and multi-modality in behaviors.
