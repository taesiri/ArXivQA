# [Structure from Duplicates: Neural Inverse Graphics from a Pile of   Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05236)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing 3D geometry, materials, and lighting from images is an ill-posed problem that typically requires many images from different viewpoints. However, obtaining such multi-view images is often impractical. This paper aims to tackle the challenging task of performing high-quality inverse graphics from just a single image.  

Key Idea:
The authors make the key observation that real-world scenes often contain duplicate/similar objects. While a single object lacks sufficient information for reconstruction, together these duplicate objects captured under different poses provide complementary information equivalent to observing an object from various viewpoints.  

Method:
The paper proposes "Structure from Duplicates (SfD)", a framework to leverage object duplicates in an image for single-image inverse graphics. The method first detects object duplicates and estimates their 6DOF poses using a SfM module adapted to handle varying in-plane rotations. With poses known, duplicates act as distinct observations of a shared geometry/material to aid reconstruction. An inverse graphics pipeline based on implicit neural representations then reasons about shape, appearance, and lighting while enforcing consistency across instances.

Contributions:
1) Novel idea of using duplicate objects in a scene as a strong prior for effective single image inverse graphics.
2) In-plane rotation robust pose estimation module to obtain 6DOF poses of object duplicates.  
3) Inverse graphics network to reconstruct shape, SVBRDF materials, and lighting by sharing information across instances.
4) New dataset of images with duplicate objects for benchmarking.

Results:
Experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art inverse rendering techniques using fewer (even single) images, demonstrating the benefit of leveraging repetitions. It also enables editing operations like object insertion and relighting using just a single photo.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel inverse graphics framework called Structure from Duplicates (SfD) that leverages multiple instances of identical objects in a single image to jointly estimate their 6DoF poses and reconstruct their shared shape, material properties, and scene illumination.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel setting called "single-view duplicate objects" (S-M), which expands the scope of inverse graphics by exploiting repetitive structures in a single image to extract multi-view information. This allows recovering 3D properties from just one image, outperforming even multi-view baselines. 

2) The paper presents a method called Structure from Duplicates (SfD) which jointly estimates 6DOF poses for duplicate objects and uses this to constrain an inverse rendering model to reconstruct consistent shape, material, and lighting.

3) The method incorporates an in-plane rotation robust pose estimation module to reliably match features between duplicate objects even under significant accidental view variations.

4) The approach leverages a geometric reconstruction module with explicit geometry and material sharing across instances. This sharing acts as an effective shape and appearance prior.

5) The paper collects and evaluates the method on a new dataset called Dup containing synthetic and real images of duplicate objects for rigorous benchmarking.

In summary, the key innovation is using duplicate objects in a single image as a form of built-in multi-view supervision for high quality inverse graphics. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance even from just one image.
