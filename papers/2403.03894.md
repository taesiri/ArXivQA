# [IRCoder: Intermediate Representations Make Language Models Robust   Multilingual Code Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code generation models (Code-LMs) have shown promise for enhancing developer productivity, but research has focused mostly on high-resource languages like Python. Performance in low-resource languages lags behind.
- Code corpora have a highly skewed distribution over programming languages compared to natural languages. This makes robust multilingual Code-LMs difficult to obtain from source code alone.
- Rapid changes in language popularity over time mean critical languages may be absent in Code-LM pre-training data.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage compiler intermediate representations (IR) as a "code interlingua" to facilitate cross-lingual transfer and align representations across languages.
- IR is produced by compiler transformations and is more language-agnostic and structured than source code.
- Create a parallel corpus of source code and IR from 12 languages (SLTrans) with 3.9M examples and 26B tokens.
- Continue pre-training several base Code-LMs on a mix of SLTrans parallel data and additional monolingual source code.

Contributions:
- SLTrans parallel source-IR dataset spanning 12 languages with 3.9M examples
- Systematic investigation showing IR grounding provides gains in prompt robustness, multilingual completion, understanding, and instruction following
- Release of IRCoder models - base Code-LMs ranging from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters, continued pre-trained on SLTrans and additional data

Key Results:
- IR grounding outperforms continued pre-training on source code or IR alone
- Robustness to perturbations improved, especially for syntax errors common in human code
- Multilingual performance boosted across the board, even for high-resource languages
- Gains indicate IR facilitates cross-lingual transfer and better alignment of concepts

In summary, grounding Code-LMs in intermediate representations enables more robust and performant multilingual models compared to source code pre-training alone. The parallel SLTrans dataset and IRCoder models contribute tools to further advance Code-LM research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes leveraging compiler intermediate representations, which are shared across programming languages, to improve the multilingual capabilities and cross-lingual transfer of code generation language models by aligning representations across languages and providing an alternative view of source code.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Creation of SLTrans, a parallel dataset of nearly 4 million pairs of source code files and corresponding intermediate representations (IR).

2) Systematic investigation of the benefits of grounding language models for code generation (Code-LMs) in IR, showing consistent empirical gains across a variety of tasks and metrics including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following. 

3) Creation and public release of a suite of base and instruction-tuned Code-LMs called IRCoder, resulting from continued pre-training of state-of-the-art Code-LMs ranging from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters on a mixture of parallel and monolingual data.

So in summary, the key contributions are creating a source code-IR parallel dataset, demonstrating performance improvements from grounding Code-LMs in IR across multiple tasks, and releasing IRCoder models trained on this parallel data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed approach of using compiler intermediate representations (IR) help align constructs across programming languages compared to existing methods that rely solely on source code? 

2. What are some potential limitations or challenges of using IR from different compiler frontends as a common representation, given variations in how languages are compiled to IR?

3. What types of semantic information does the LLVM IR capture that facilitates cross-lingual transfer between programming languages compared to relying only on raw source code?

4. How does grounding on IR provide more robustness to syntactic variations and perturbations compared to models trained only on source code? What specific properties of IR contribute to this?

5. Beyond code completion, understanding, and instruction following evaluated in this paper, what other potential applications could benefit from grounding models on IR?

6. How does the proposed IR grounding approach compare to other techniques for facilitating cross-lingual transfer such as parameter sharing, model splicing, or metalearning? What are relative advantages?  

7. What types of programming languages and language features would be more or less amenable to IR-based grounding proposed in this method?

8. How could the IR grounding approach be extended to multi-file programs and contexts beyond single self-contained files? What additional challenges does this present?

9. How was the SLTrans dataset constructed to provide high-quality and balanced examples across programming languages? What measures were taken to avoid bias?

10. Beyond continued pre-training, how else could models leverage parallel source code and IR data? What modifications to model architecture or training objectives could further exploit this?
