# [Learning Transferable Spatiotemporal Representations from Natural Script   Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15280)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is using natural language semantics from automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts to improve the learning of transferable spatiotemporal video representations. 

Specifically, the paper argues that existing video representation learning methods rely only on visual information and lack explicit semantics, which limits their transferability and applicability to real-world uncurated video data. 

To address this, the paper proposes a new pretext task called "Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting" (TVTS). The key idea is to predict the order of shuffled ASR transcripts by attending to encoded video representations. This forces the model to contextualize events over time and perform temporal reasoning to match transcripts, improving spatiotemporal representations.

The central hypothesis is that by exploiting natural language semantics from ASR transcripts, the model can learn video representations that are more transferable and applicable to uncurated real-world video data compared to methods that use only visual information. The pretext task TVTS is designed to enable such learning.

In summary, the paper introduces TVTS pretext task to learn transferable spatiotemporal video representations by leveraging rich semantics from ASR transcript knowledge along with the video data itself.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper proposes a new pretext task called Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS) for video pre-training. The key idea is to sort shuffled automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts by attending to the corresponding video representations. This forces the model to contextualize what is happening in the video over time in order to figure out the correct order of the transcripts. 

2. The paper shows that using natural language supervision from ASR transcripts of the videos themselves is an effective way to learn transferable spatiotemporal video representations. This avoids the need for descriptive video captions which are difficult to obtain at scale. The ASR transcripts provide useful semantics about events happening in the video over time.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed TVTS pretext task. The pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art results on downstream action recognition tasks, especially on Something-Something V2 which requires fine-grained temporal modeling. It also shows strong zero-shot transferability via video retrieval and linear classification.

In summary, the key novelty is using self-supervision from natural ASR transcripts to learn better spatiotemporal video representations via a transcript sorting pretext task. This facilitates complex temporal understanding and outperforms methods that rely only on visual cues or descriptive captions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS) to learn transferable spatiotemporal video representations by leveraging the rich semantics from natural language scripts that come with videos, achieving strong out-of-the-box performance on action recognition tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new method for learning transferable spatiotemporal video representations using natural language supervision from video transcripts. Here are some key comparisons to other related works:

- Compared to other video representation learning methods like VideoMAE, this paper shows superior transferability (e.g. +13.6% gain on SSV2 via linear probing). It argues previous methods rely only on visual signals like pixel reconstruction and lack semantic understanding. 

- Compared to video-text alignment methods like Frozen, this paper focuses on learning spatiotemporal video representations rather than just cross-modal alignment. It shows stronger results on action recognition which requires temporal modeling.

- Compared to multimodal methods like MERLOT, this paper uses language to supervise the video encoder rather than fuse representations. It shows ordering frames as in MERLOT is counterproductive for learning video representations.

- Compared to image-text methods like CLIP, this paper introduces a way to utilize language for temporal understanding, not just spatial concepts. It uses natural video transcripts rather than human captions.

In summary, the key novelties are using inherent noisy transcripts for supervision, the pretext task of transcript ordering for temporal reasoning, and demonstrating improved transferable video representations. This direction of using language semantics to enhance video understanding is relatively less explored previously.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Further improving the out-of-the-box transferability of learned video representations by better exploiting multimodal semantics. The authors show promising results exploiting ASR transcripts and suggest exploring other natural semantics tied to videos.

- Alleviating the effect of noisy ASR transcripts. Though helpful for long-term temporal understanding, the authors note the detriment of noisy transcripts to text encoder training and text-video alignment. Further research could aim to address this issue.  

- Evaluating the effectiveness of the method on other backbone architectures and larger-scale datasets. The authors use a ViT architecture on a few benchmark datasets, so expanding to other models and more data could be beneficial.

- Demonstrating the cognitive capabilities of the model on more applications. The authors' method shows strong results on action recognition, but they suggest it may have potential for more complex video understanding tasks relying on contextual reasoning.

- Exploring other pre-training objectives and mechanisms to learn transferable spatiotemporal video representations. The transcript sorting task is effective but further tasks could be designed to capture temporal semantics.

- Addressing the spatial bias in existing video representation learning methods. The authors note current methods lack long-term temporal reasoning, so future work could aim to better balance spatial and temporal modeling.

Overall, the main directions focus on improving transferability, leveraging multimodal data more effectively, scaling up in terms of model architecture and datasets, evaluating on more complex tasks, and overcoming limitations like spatial bias in current methods. Advancing research along these lines could lead to more flexible, scalable, and cognitively-powerful video representation learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on out-of-the-box spatiotemporal representation learning for videos. The authors argue that existing methods like VideoMAE show limited transferability when evaluated by linear probing on datasets like Something-Something V2. They attribute this to the lack of explicit semantics and reliance on highly curated datasets like Kinetics-400 in previous works. Inspired by image-text contrastive learning methods like CLIP, the authors propose a new pretext task called Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS). It leverages the natural speech transcripts in videos as a source of noisy but useful semantics over time. Specifically, given shuffled transcripts of a video, the model must contextualize the video clip to correctly sort the transcripts. This is realized via joint attention between visual and text representations. Experiments show the model learns improved spatiotemporal representations that transfer better to action recognition compared to state-of-the-art methods. The approach is also scalable to large uncurated video datasets.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new pretext task called Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS) for self-supervised video representation learning. The key idea is to leverage the natural language transcripts that come with many videos as a supervision signal. Specifically, the method samples consecutive transcripts from a video, shuffles them, and trains a model to sort them back into the correct order by attending to spatiotemporal features from the video. This forces the model to build an understanding of the events in the video over time so it can piece together the narrative. 

The method is evaluated on downstream action recognition and text-to-video retrieval tasks. Results show TVTS learns strong out-of-the-box spatiotemporal representations that transfer well, outperforming prior work like VideoMAE. For example, TVTS achieves a 13.6% gain over VideoMAE on Something-Something V2 for linear probe evaluation. The improved representations likely come from the model grounding the visual features in the semantic information provided by transcripts, rather than just pixel-level signals. Overall, the work demonstrates the promise of leveraging readily available transcripts as a natural form of supervision for more capable video representations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new pretext task called Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS) for self-supervised video representation learning. 

The key ideas are:

- Sample consecutive ASR transcripts from a video along with a corresponding video clip. Shuffle the transcript order randomly. 

- Encode the video clip with a vision transformer to get video representations. Encode the shuffled transcripts with a text encoder to get text representations.

- Perform joint attention between the text and video representations to predict the actual order of the shuffled transcripts. This is modeled as a K-way classification problem.

- The order prediction task acts as a self-supervised proxy that forces the vision transformer to understand the spatiotemporal context in the video, so it can provide enough knowledge to figure out the correct transcript order.

- An additional contrastive loss between global video and text features is used to align the modalities.

So in summary, the transcript ordering task provides temporal supervision to make the video representation capture better spatiotemporal semantics. This differs from prior work like Frozen that only looks at video-text alignment. The ordering task also differs from Merlot which ordered frames rather than transcripts.

The pre-trained model shows significantly improved transfer learning performance on action recognition compared to prior video self-supervised methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of learning transferable spatiotemporal video representations that can generalize well to diverse downstream tasks. 

Some key points:

- Existing video representation learning methods show limited transferability, especially on out-of-domain datasets. They rely on highly curated datasets like Kinetics-400.

- Current methods lack long-term temporal reasoning ability and often exhibit a "spatial bias". They fail to exploit rich spatiotemporal semantics in videos. 

- The paper argues the key is to leverage language semantics to enable cognition-level spatiotemporal understanding, inspired by image-text pre-training like CLIP.

- But two challenges remain: 1) learning transferable temporal representations with language supervision; 2) obtaining large-scale video data with descriptive captions is difficult.

- This paper proposes a new pretext task "Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS)" that exploits natural speech transcripts along with videos to provide noisy but useful semantics over time.

- TVTS promotes temporal contextualization and reasoning by predicting order of shuffled transcripts based on video content understanding.

- This facilitates learning transferable spatiotemporal video representations, especially temporal, that can generalize to downstream action recognition.

In summary, the paper aims to address the limited transferability of current video representation learning methods by leveraging natural language semantics, especially from readily available but noisy speech transcripts, to enable stronger temporal reasoning. The proposed TVTS pretext task is designed specifically to promote such ability.
