# [PRIME: Protect Your Videos From Malicious Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01239)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models for image and video editing are advancing rapidly, enabling easy manipulation and potentially malicious uses. 
- Existing image protection methods against such misuse have limitations when extended to videos, in terms of efficiency and robustness to video compression.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose PRIME, a new video protection method to hinder malicious editing. 
- PRIME has "zero-shot ability" to improve transferability across models/pipelines used by attackers. It considers both latent encodings and generated images when creating adversarial perturbations.
- To accelerate optimization, PRIME uses "fast convergence searching" to find better target images and "early stage stopping" to reduce steps.  
- For robustness to compression, PRIME discretizes perturbations to simulate codec effects.

Experiments and Results:
- PRIME achieved better protection than prior art Photoguard, with only 8.3% of its GPU cost.
- It increased bitrate by 8% compared to Photoguard, preserving more information.
- Both objective metrics and human evaluation show PRIME's superiority over baselines in hindering malicious editing quality and matching prompts.

Main Contributions:
- First study on protecting videos against two types of malicious editing tasks.
- Proposal of an efficient video protection method PRIME with zero-shot transferability.
- New mechanisms for faster optimization and combating dynamic compression effects.
- Comprehensive analysis of PRIME using both objective metrics and human evaluation.

In summary, the paper presents PRIME to effectively and efficiently protect videos from malicious editing by generative models, outperforming prior image protection techniques. The method and experiments provide valuable insights on this emerging problem space.
