# [Continuous optimization by quantum adaptive distribution search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17353)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a new quantum algorithm for continuous optimization called Quantum Adaptive Distribution Search (QuADS). QuADS integrates the quantum search capabilities of Grover Adaptive Search (GAS) with the efficient distribution updating mechanism of the classical Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Specifically, QuADS utilizes an adaptive multivariate normal distribution to generate the initial state for quantum amplitude amplification in each search iteration, rather than using a uniform state like in vanilla GAS. The distribution parameters are updated using the same equations as CMA-ES to exploit insights about the objective function structure. Through numerical experiments on various benchmark functions, QuADS is shown to consistently outperform both GAS and CMA-ES in terms of expected number of function evaluations to find the global optimum. This advantage stems from more efficient sampling enabled by the adaptive distributions, resulting in fewer oracle calls per iteration. The results demonstrate the promise of QuADS as an accelerated continuous optimizer tailored to leverage quantum computing resources.
