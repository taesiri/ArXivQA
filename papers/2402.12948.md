# [GumbelSoft: Diversified Language Model Watermarking via the   GumbelMax-trick](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate remarkably human-like text, but also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious applications like fake news.  
- Effective detection of machine-generated text is becoming crucial. Decoding-based watermarks like the GumbelMax-trick-based watermark (GM watermark) are highly effective.
- However, a major limitation of GM watermarks is that they produce identical responses to identical prompts, negatively impacting diversity and user experience. 

Proposed Solution:
- Identify the deterministic Decoder and Pseudo-random functions as the cause of identical responses. 
- Propose 3 strategies to introduce variability:
   1. Implement dropout to directly sample from the LM  
   2. Replace argmax with sampling from softmax in GM watermark  
   3. Randomize the watermark key by cyclic shifts
- Question the need for an exponential transform in GM watermarks. Propose new Logits-Addition GM watermark.
- From experiments on 3 GM variants, identify GumbelSoft (the softmax variant of Logits-Addition) as optimal.

Main Contributions:  
- Provide a unified taxonomy for decoding-based watermarking techniques.
- Propose Logits-Addition as a new type of GM watermark and analyze its statistical properties.  
- Introduce 3 variants of GM watermarks aimed at improving diversity.
- Demonstrate through experiments that GumbelSoft outperforms other variants in both diversity and detectability. Also show superior performance over existing decoding-based watermarks.

In summary, the paper addresses the diversity limitation of GM watermarks via the proposed GumbelSoft technique, with experimental validations highlighting its effectiveness. The unified watermarking framework and new Logits-Addition GM watermark are other notable contributions.
