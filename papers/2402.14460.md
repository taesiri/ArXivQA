# [Reframing the Expected Free Energy: Four Formulations and a Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14460)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The expected free energy (EFE) is central to active inference and has several formulations (risk/ambiguity, information gain/pragmatic value, etc.). However, there is no consensus on a single "root" definition for the EFE or a unified framework to derive the different formulations. 

- The paper formalizes the problem of deriving the four main EFE formulations from a root definition as the "unification problem". Solving this would provide a foundation for justifying and using the EFE in practice.

- An issue is that the EFE relies on prior preferences over observations denoted $P(\overline{o})$. But $P(\overline{o})$ also refers to the marginal likelihood in the generative model, leading to inconsistencies. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores two settings with different root EFE definitions and forecast/target distributions.

- In the first setting, the root EFE is defined as risk over observations plus ambiguity. This unifies all four formulations. However, there is a conflict between arbitrary prior preferences $P(\overline{o})$ and the likelihood mapping. Only a limited class of $P(\overline{o})$ is valid.

- The second setting uses risk over states plus ambiguity as the root EFE. This is justified from first principles but only derives two formulations.

Main Contributions:
- Formalized the problem of unifying different EFE formulations as the "unification problem".

- Identified issues with dual meaning of $P(\overline{o})$ leading to inconsistencies. 

- Demonstrated how the choice of root EFE definition and assumptions affects which formulations can be derived. 

- Showed that arbitrary prior preferences $P(\overline{o})$ can conflict with the likelihood mapping. Characterized the valid class of $P(\overline{o})$.

- Clarified that no proposed root EFE definition can both recover all four formulations and be theoretically justified. This highlights open problems for justifying the EFE.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper formalizes the problem of deriving four formulations of the expected free energy in active inference from a single root definition, studies limitations when defining prior preferences over observations, and shows that currently no setting allows recovering all formulations while also justifying the root expected free energy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the formalization of the expected free energy definition and the problem of deriving its four common formulations (referred to as the unification problem). Specifically:

- The paper clearly defines the forecast and target distributions that are the basis for the expected free energy calculations. 

- It formalizes the unification problem as finding a single root expected free energy definition that allows derivation of the four common formulations: risk over states plus ambiguity, risk over observations plus ambiguity, information gain plus pragmatic value, and expected energy plus entropy.

- The paper shows that defining expected free energy as risk over observations plus ambiguity allows deriving all four formulations. However, it also shows that this definition restricts the valid class of prior preferences over observations.

- An alternative definition as risk over states plus ambiguity is justified from first principles, but only allows deriving two of the four formulations. 

- Thus the paper clarifies the limitations around defining expected free energy in a way that provides theoretical connections between the formulations, while also allowing flexible specification of prior preferences.

In summary, the key contribution is the formalization and analysis of the unification problem for expected free energy formulations. This provides a foundation for future research, especially in implementing expected free energy calculations with deep neural networks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms are:

- Active inference - A leading theory of perception, learning and decision making that can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. 

- Expected free energy (EFE) - A function defining the cost of performing a policy that trades off exploration and exploitation. Has several formulations such as risk plus ambiguity, information gain / pragmatic value, etc.

- Unification problem - The problem of deriving the four main EFE formulations from a single root EFE definition. 

- Forecast distribution - Predicts the future according to the agent's beliefs about current states and its generative model.  

- Target distribution - Encodes the states and observations the agent wants to reach.

- Generative model - Encodes the agent's prior beliefs about environment dynamics. Composed of hidden states, observations made, and actions taken.  

- Variational distribution - Approximates the true posterior over latent variables. Used for inference.

- Variational free energy - Trades off accuracy and complexity when performing inference. Minimizing it is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence between the variational and true posteriors.

- Planning - The goal of identifying the policy (sequence of actions) with the smallest expected free energy.

So in summary, the key concepts revolve around active inference, the expected free energy, inference, planning, and the unification problem between the different EFE formulations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask to better understand the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper defines a "unification problem" to derive four expected free energy (EFE) formulations from a single root definition. However, in the end, it seems they were unable to actually unify the formulations. What is preventing the unification of the EFE formulations? 

2) The paper shows the risk over states plus ambiguity formulation ($\mathcal{C}_{RSA}$) is justified from first principles, but other formulations like risk over observations ($\mathcal{C}_{ROA}$) are not. Why can't similar derivations justify the other formulations?

3) The conflict between prior preferences and likelihood mappings is an interesting finding. Intuitively, why would defining prior preferences over observations lead to conflicts, while defining them over states does not?

4) Table 1 summarizes an interesting trade-off - one EFE definition recovers all 4 formulations but lacks justification, while the other has justification but only gets 2 formulations. Is there a way to get the "best of both worlds" here?

5) How exactly does the forecast distribution provide a "bridge" between the variational posterior and generative model? What techniques allow moving probabilistic factors between these different distributions?

6) The paper mentions the possibility of using different EFE factorizations or alternative derivations to solve the unification problem. What are some potential ways the factorizations could be changed?

7) Is the conflict between prior preferences and likelihood mapping fundamental or could it be resolved by tweaking assumptions? Would relaxing the mean-field approximation help for example?  

8) How difficult is it in practice to ensure prior preference vectors lie within the projected simplex after the likelihood transformation? Does this restriction limit applications?

9) For planning and control, do the limitations described here alter how the expected free energy is used to select optimal actions?

10) The paper focuses on discrete variables and a finite time horizon. How would results change for continuous states or in the limit of an infinite horizon?
