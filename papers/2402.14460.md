# [Reframing the Expected Free Energy: Four Formulations and a Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14460)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The expected free energy (EFE) is central to active inference and has several formulations (risk/ambiguity, information gain/pragmatic value, etc.). However, there is no consensus on a single "root" definition for the EFE or a unified framework to derive the different formulations. 

- The paper formalizes the problem of deriving the four main EFE formulations from a root definition as the "unification problem". Solving this would provide a foundation for justifying and using the EFE in practice.

- An issue is that the EFE relies on prior preferences over observations denoted $P(\overline{o})$. But $P(\overline{o})$ also refers to the marginal likelihood in the generative model, leading to inconsistencies. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores two settings with different root EFE definitions and forecast/target distributions.

- In the first setting, the root EFE is defined as risk over observations plus ambiguity. This unifies all four formulations. However, there is a conflict between arbitrary prior preferences $P(\overline{o})$ and the likelihood mapping. Only a limited class of $P(\overline{o})$ is valid.

- The second setting uses risk over states plus ambiguity as the root EFE. This is justified from first principles but only derives two formulations.

Main Contributions:
- Formalized the problem of unifying different EFE formulations as the "unification problem".

- Identified issues with dual meaning of $P(\overline{o})$ leading to inconsistencies. 

- Demonstrated how the choice of root EFE definition and assumptions affects which formulations can be derived. 

- Showed that arbitrary prior preferences $P(\overline{o})$ can conflict with the likelihood mapping. Characterized the valid class of $P(\overline{o})$.

- Clarified that no proposed root EFE definition can both recover all four formulations and be theoretically justified. This highlights open problems for justifying the EFE.
