# [Discovering Low-rank Subspaces for Language-agnostic Multilingual   Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05792)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large pretrained multilingual language models (ML-LMs) like mBERT show impressive zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities without direct supervision. 
- However, prior work has shown these models encode strong language-specific signals, causing representations to cluster by language rather than semantics. This hinders performance on semantic tasks like cross-lingual retrieval.
- It is desirable to remove such language identity signals to better leverage semantic information shared across languages.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a method called LSAR to discover a low-rank subspace in ML-LMs that primarily encodes language-specific signals irrelevant to semantics. 
- LSAR is unsupervised, based on singular value decomposition (SVD) of mean embeddings from multiple languages. It identifies a subspace that captures cross-lingual latent discrepancy.
- Once found, embeddings can be projected into the null space of this subspace to suppress unwanted language factors without finetuning the original ML-LM.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneering work to show low-rank subspaces exist in ML-LMs that mainly encode language-specific signals.
- Simple but effective unsupervised SVD-based approach (LSAR) to identify such a subspace and use it to boost language agnosticism.
- Empirical results show LSAR consistently improves performance over baseline ML-LMs on various semantic tasks including challenging cross-lingual QA retrieval.
- Analysis reveals subspace captures primarily syntactic signals, implying LSAR removes linguistics factors redundant for semantics.

In summary, the paper presents a novel perspective and method to locate and suppress language-specific signals in ML-LMs to produce better language-agnostic multilingual representations for semantic tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an unsupervised method called LSAR to identify and remove a low-rank subspace encoding language-specific signals from multilingual language model embeddings, in order to improve cross-lingual transfer through greater language agnosticism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Presenting one of the first efforts to discover that there exist low-rank subspaces of pretrained multilingual language models' embeddings that mainly encode language-specific signals.

2. Proposing a simple unsupervised approach called LSAR based on singular value decomposition to identify such a subspace in a multilingual language model. By projecting embeddings onto the null space of this subspace, LSAR can exclude the unwanted language-specific factors to facilitate language agnosticism. 

3. Showing through empirical results that LSAR is surprisingly effective in improving performance on a variety of semantic tasks that require language agnostic representations.

4. Providing evidence through analysis that the identified subspace exhibits strong correlation with syntactic information, suggesting that LSAR primarily removes syntactic signals from the embeddings.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an effective method to locate and remove language-specific signals, particularly syntactic information, from multilingual embeddings in order to improve their language agnosticism for semantic tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multilingual language models (ML-LMs) - The paper focuses on analyzing and improving pretrained models like mBERT, XLM, XLM-R that are trained on text from multiple languages.

- Language identity signals - The paper examines the issue of multilingual models encoding strong language-specific signals that cluster embeddings by language rather than semantics. 

- Language agnosticism - A key goal is producing multilingual representations that exhibit less language identity and greater language agnosticism so they can transfer across languages.

- Low-rank subspace - The paper proposes identifying and removing a low-rank subspace encoding primarily language-specific signals unrelated to semantics in order to improve language agnosticism.

- Unsupervised method - The proposed LSAR method identifies the problematic subspace in an unsupervised manner without needing parallel data. 

- Singular value decomposition - The core technique used by LSAR to locate the low-rank language-specific subspace in a pretrained multilingual model.

- Projection to null space - After finding the problematic subspace via SVD, LSAR projects embeddings into the null space to suppress unwanted language factors.

- Language similarity - Analysis examines correlations between language similarities captured in the removed subspace and typological databases to elucidate that syntactic relations are being factored out.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes to identify a low-rank subspace that primarily encodes language-specific signals. What is the rationale behind assuming such a subspace exists? Does this build on any prior work in domain adaptation/generalization?

2. Algorithm 1 shows the procedure to identify the low-rank subspace. Walk through the key steps and explain the intuition behind approximating the mean embedding matrix M with a low rank component and a component that captures what is common across languages. 

3. After identifying the subspace, the paper projects embeddings onto the null space to remove unwanted factors. Explain why projecting onto the null space helps remove language-specific factors without leading to loss of information.

4. The paper evaluates the method on semantic tasks like retrieval and classification. Why are these tasks appropriate for evaluating language agnosticism of the resulting embeddings? What other tasks could also be suitable?

5. On the LAReQA benchmark, the method shows significant gains over baselines in facilitating language agnostic retrieval. Analyze the PCA plots shown in Figure 3 and discuss why the improvements are evident.  

6. Results show that the method struggles to provide gains on top of LASER embeddings since those already use parallel data. How can the ideas from this method be combined with training objectives that use parallel data?

7. The analysis reveals high correlation between languages similarities captured by the low-rank subspace and syntactic similarities from typological data. Discuss what this implies about the information captured by the subspace.

8. The choice of number of directions r to project away plays an important role in performance of the method. Critically analyze how performance varies with r on different tasks like retrieval and classification.

9. While promising results are shown on semantic tasks, the paper also identifies some limitations. Elaborate on the limitations and discuss how they can potentially be addressed through future work.

10. The simplicity of the singular value decomposition based approach is appealing. Discuss how this idea of locating and projecting away unwanted directions can be extended to other domains like image representations.
