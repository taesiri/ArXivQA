# [Investigating the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Code Clone   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Code clones (identical or similar code fragments) can propagate bugs. Detecting code clones, especially semantically equivalent clones (Type-4), is challenging but needed to maintain code quality. 
- Traditional deep learning models for code clone detection (CCD) struggle with unseen data and cross-language detection.  
- There is limited research on using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for non-generative tasks like classification and specifically for CCD.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate the efficacy of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, for detecting Type-4 clones in a zero-shot setting without training data. 
- Design prompts to encourage ChatGPT to effectively identify code clones.
- Build mono-lingual (Java-Java) and cross-lingual (Java-Ruby) clone detection datasets from CodeNet.
- Compare ChatGPT's clone detection performance with fine-tuned deep learning baselines.
- Analyze the impact of problem complexity on ChatGPT's accuracy.

Key Contributions:
- Designed prompts enabling ChatGPT to achieve strong performance - F1 Score of 0.878 on Java-Java and 0.877 on Java-Ruby pairs.
- Demonstrated ChatGPT's reasoning ability surpasses fine-tuned baselines for cross-language clone detection.
- Showed problem complexity influences ChatGPT's clone detection capability.
- Provided first benchmark of LLMs on non-generative CCD task.
- Established prompts and methodology to assess LLMs for classification tasks.

The paper delivers valuable insights into leveraging LLMs for non-generative problems like CCD while highlighting factors impacting their performance. It opens promising research directions to further explore LLMs in software engineering.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the performance and limitations of using large language models like ChatGPT for code clone detection, including both mono-lingual and cross-lingual settings, finding that ChatGPT surpasses baselines on cross-lingual tasks while achieving comparable results to fine-tuned models on mono-lingual tasks, with problem complexity impacting its effectiveness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper investigates the efficacy of using large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, for the task of code clone detection (CCD). It examines both monolingual CCD (between Java code snippets) and cross-lingual CCD (between Java and Ruby code snippets). The key findings and contributions are:

1) Designing an effective prompt for guiding ChatGPT to detect Type-4 clones in a zero-shot setting. The proposed prompt asks ChatGPT to evaluate if two code snippets solve the same problem with identical inputs/outputs.

2) Demonstrating that with the right prompt design, ChatGPT can achieve an F1 score of 0.878 on monolingual CCD and 0.877 on cross-lingual CCD, which is comparable or better than fine-tuned baseline models like CodeBERT.

3) Analyzing the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT for CCD based on problem complexity metrics. The results indicate ChatGPT struggles more with more complex code clone pairs.

4) Providing the first empirical evidence for the applicability of LLMs to monolingual and cross-lingual CCD in a zero-shot setting. The findings can inform future research directions on leveraging reasoning abilities of LLMs for software tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is showing the promise of LLMs for CCD by designing an effective prompt and evaluating the performance and limitations in comparison to baselines. The paper provides novel insights into a relatively less explored application area of LLMs.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper investigates two research questions (RQ1 and RQ2). What are these research questions and what specifically is each one trying to analyze in regards to using ChatGPT for code clone detection?

2. Explain in detail the prompt design process outlined in the paper. Why was the initial simple prompt asking if two code snippets are clones ineffective? How did the authors modify the prompt to improve ChatGPT's performance on clone detection? 

3. The paper evaluates performance using F1-score, cyclomatic complexity, and acceptance rate. Explain what each of these metrics represents and why they were chosen to analyze ChatGPT's clone detection capabilities. 

4. For the clone detection datasets, the paper used CodeNet rather than more standard datasets. Explain the rationale behind using CodeNet and what advantages or disadvantages this choice may have had on the results.

5. In the discussion of the results, the paper notes ChatGPT's performance drop on more complex problems. Analyze the complexity analysis done, including metrics used and results found. Why might greater complexity impact ChatGPT's reasoning abilities?

6. The paper only investigates ChatGPT's capabilities on Java and Ruby code. Discuss how the choice of languages may have impacted results and how performance might differ for other programming languages.

7. Propose some methods the authors could use to further analyze the differences found between ChatGPT's mono-lingual and cross-lingual clone detection performance. What factors may explain why ChatGPT exceeded baseline models on the cross-lingual task?

8. The paper compares a zero-shot ChatGPT to fully fine-tuned baseline models. Discuss the limitations of this comparison and how results might differ if baselines were also zero-shot or if ChatGPT was fine-tuned.  

9. Analyze some possible real-world applications and use cases that could benefit from ChatGPT's code clone detection capabilities. What implementations might be best suited for this approach over other techniques?

10. The paper mentions future plans to test other LLMs beyond ChatGPT. Compare and contrast different LLMs and their unique capabilities. Which other LLMs seem most promising for code clone detection and why?
