# [Bidirectional Cross-Modal Knowledge Exploration for Video Recognition   with Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00182)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

Can we better utilize pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP for video recognition by exploring bidirectional cross-modal knowledge transfer? 

The key points are:

- Previous works using CLIP for video recognition have only utilized unidirectional video-to-text matching. This paper argues we should facilitate bidirectional knowledge transfer to fully leverage CLIP's capabilities.

- The paper proposes mining both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video knowledge from CLIP:

1) In the Video-to-Text direction, they introduce a Video-Attribute Association mechanism to generate textual attributes from the video for complementary recognition.

2) In the Text-to-Video direction, they propose a Video Concept Spotting mechanism to generate temporal saliency from the category text for enhanced video representation.

- They combine these mechanisms into a framework called BIKE that achieves state-of-the-art results by exploring bidirectional knowledge between vision and language domains using CLIP.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that bidirectional cross-modal knowledge transfer can better utilize CLIP for video recognition compared to previous unidirectional approaches. The proposed BIKE framework provides a way to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel framework called BIKE for video recognition using pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP. The key ideas and contributions are:

1. It explores bidirectional cross-modal knowledge from VLMs to enhance video recognition:

- In the Video-to-Text direction, it introduces a Video-Attributes Association mechanism to generate textual attributes of the video for auxiliary recognition. 

- In the Text-to-Video direction, it proposes a Video Concept Spotting mechanism to generate temporal saliency for enhanced video representation.

2. The Attributes branch uses generated textual attributes for complementary video recognition.

3. The Video branch uses category-dependent temporal saliency to obtain a compact video representation. 

4. Evaluations on datasets like Kinetics, UCF-101, HMDB-51 etc. show BIKE achieves state-of-the-art performance on general, zero-shot and few-shot video recognition.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel BIKE framework that effectively utilizes bidirectional knowledge from pre-trained VLMs via attributes association and concept spotting to achieve enhanced video recognition.
