# [Robust Geometry and Reflectance Disentanglement for 3D Face   Reconstruction from Sparse-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06085)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for high-fidelity facial decomposition and reconstruction from sparse multi-view images. The method learns a parametric facial template consisting of geometry, reflectance and illumination in a two-stage training process. The geometry template captures detailed normals and displacements, while the reflectance template encodes BRDF properties including diffuse albedo, specular intensity and subsurface scattering. In stage 1, the parametric template is trained on 10 subjects to acquire comprehensive prior knowledge. Stage 2 further adapts the template to new subjects not seen in stage 1 by learning subject-specific deformations and reflectance details. For inference, only 2-3 input views are required toproduce high-quality renderings as well as disentangled geometry and reflectance. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the method's effectiveness for facial decomposition under a sparse view setting. It also enables controllable editing by manipulating the illumination, specular intensity and displacement parameters. Compared to existing works, the paper achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, geometry accuracy and reflectance decomposition. The two-stage training is key to learning a robust generalizable template to facilitate reliable decomposition despite limited input views.
