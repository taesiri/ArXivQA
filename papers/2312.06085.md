# [Robust Geometry and Reflectance Disentanglement for 3D Face   Reconstruction from Sparse-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06085)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for high-fidelity facial decomposition and reconstruction from sparse multi-view images. The method learns a parametric facial template consisting of geometry, reflectance and illumination in a two-stage training process. The geometry template captures detailed normals and displacements, while the reflectance template encodes BRDF properties including diffuse albedo, specular intensity and subsurface scattering. In stage 1, the parametric template is trained on 10 subjects to acquire comprehensive prior knowledge. Stage 2 further adapts the template to new subjects not seen in stage 1 by learning subject-specific deformations and reflectance details. For inference, only 2-3 input views are required toproduce high-quality renderings as well as disentangled geometry and reflectance. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the method's effectiveness for facial decomposition under a sparse view setting. It also enables controllable editing by manipulating the illumination, specular intensity and displacement parameters. Compared to existing works, the paper achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, geometry accuracy and reflectance decomposition. The two-stage training is key to learning a robust generalizable template to facilitate reliable decomposition despite limited input views.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Facial appearance modeling from limited image views is challenging, as it requires jointly recovering facial geometry and reflectance (BRDF) from incomplete data. 
- Existing methods either focus solely on geometry reconstruction or have limitations in reflectance estimation accuracy and editability.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new approach for model-based face appearance decomposition from a small set of unconstrained images. 
- The key idea is to leverage a learned parametric face template with coupled geometry and reflectance as strong prior knowledge. 
- The method has two stages - (1) Learn a multi-view facial template with geometry and spatially-varying BRDF parameters, (2) Fit the template to new subjects, while allowing for subject-specific adjustments.

Technical Details:
- The facial template uses an implicit function for geometry and a physically-based rendering model for reflectance. 
- In stage 1, the template is trained on multi-view data to capture consistent face shape and reflectance.  
- In stage 2, the pre-trained template parameters are fitted to a target subject via optimization, while allowing offset modules to adapt the template.

Main Contributions:
- A new model-based framework for joint facial geometry and BRDF estimation from limited image views by leveraging a coupled facial prior template.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in appearance reconstruction, editing and relighting compared to previous geometry-only or BRDF-only methods.  
- Demonstrates high-quality decomposition results from as few as 3 views, significantly lower than previous model-based techniques.
- The introduced facial template can serve as an strong inductive bias for various facial analysis tasks.
