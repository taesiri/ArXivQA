# [LexAbSumm: Aspect-based Summarization of Legal Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00594)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing legal case summarization systems and datasets provide generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that may not meet the diverse information needs of different users. However, legal documents are multifaceted, often containing distinct aspects relevant to different users. There is a need for aspect-based summarization systems that can generate concise, aspect-specific summaries catering to users' specific needs more effectively.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces LexAbSumm, the first aspect-based summarization dataset for legal judgments, sourced from fact sheets of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). It contains aspect-judgment-summary triplets, with the aspect representing the user's information need. The authors evaluate several abstractive summarization models designed for longer documents on LexAbSumm.

Key Contributions:
- Introduced LexAbSumm, a novel dataset tailored for aspect-based summarization of ECtHR legal judgments with 376 unique aspects and 1053 triplets.
- Created dataset splits conditioned on facts, law sections and whole judgment to produce corresponding summaries.  
- Evaluated long-range abstractive models like LED, LongT5, showing SLED and Unlimiformer achieve best performance.
- Analysis showed models struggle with unseen aspects and aspect conditioning, indicating opportunities for improvement.
- First work to address aspect-based summarization for legal judgments to meet diverse user needs.

The paper highlighted the limitations of current legal case summarization systems in addressing users' differentiated needs. Through LexAbSumm and evaluation of models, it revealed specific gaps in aspect conditioning that can drive further research towards building aspect-aware legal summarization systems.
