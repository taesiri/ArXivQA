# [Using Surprise Index for Competency Assessment in Autonomous   Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09033)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a closed-form solution to compute the Surprise Index (SI) for multivariate Gaussian measurement models, which provides a quantitative way to assess how well an autonomous system's performance matches expectations. The key insight is that the probability distribution of possible measurement sequences can be ordered by Mahalanobis distance contours from the mean, allowing integration over less probable sequences. This leads to an expression for SI in terms of the cumulative distribution function of a chi-squared distribution. The authors validate their analytical SI computation against an empirical approximation method on a GPS localization example. They then demonstrate its utility to evaluate a reinforcement learning-based spacecraft maneuvering policy, using sigma points to propagate state uncertainty distributions through the nonlinear dynamics. The results show how SI can effectively indicate deviations from an expected reference trajectory as the policy is stressed with increasing initial state uncertainty outside its training distribution. Overall, this provides a useful new capability to quantitatively assess autonomous system competence.
