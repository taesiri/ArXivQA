# [Using Surprise Index for Competency Assessment in Autonomous   Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09033)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a closed-form solution to compute the Surprise Index (SI) for multivariate Gaussian measurement models, which provides a quantitative way to assess how well an autonomous system's performance matches expectations. The key insight is that the probability distribution of possible measurement sequences can be ordered by Mahalanobis distance contours from the mean, allowing integration over less probable sequences. This leads to an expression for SI in terms of the cumulative distribution function of a chi-squared distribution. The authors validate their analytical SI computation against an empirical approximation method on a GPS localization example. They then demonstrate its utility to evaluate a reinforcement learning-based spacecraft maneuvering policy, using sigma points to propagate state uncertainty distributions through the nonlinear dynamics. The results show how SI can effectively indicate deviations from an expected reference trajectory as the policy is stressed with increasing initial state uncertainty outside its training distribution. Overall, this provides a useful new capability to quantitatively assess autonomous system competence.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous systems relying on machine learning models can behave like "black boxes", making it challenging to evaluate their competency and ensure they perform as expected. 
- Existing metrics like surprise index can assess model quality but are computationally intractable to calculate exactly.

Proposed Solution:
- Derive a closed-form solution to calculate the surprise index for multivariate Gaussian measurement models. 
- Leverage sigma point transformation to propagate uncertainty through nonlinear dynamic systems and approximate the surprise index.

Key Contributions:
- Closed-form surprise index calculation for multivariate Gaussians, enabling efficient evaluation.
- Validation on GPS localization example against brute force empirical approximation.
- Application to nonlinear spacecraft maneuvering problem using reinforcement learning control policy.
- Demonstrated that surprise index can effectively indicate when spacecraft trajectory diverges from expected behavior.

Overall, the paper tackles the challenge of evaluating opaque learning-based autonomous systems by making surprise index calculation tractable. The authors apply this to a spacecraft maneuver case study to highlight how surprise index can reveal when a reinforcement learning control policy results in unexpected spacecraft trajectories. This provides a way to assess system competency for safe and reliable operation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper develops a closed-form solution to efficiently compute the Surprise Index for assessing the competency of autonomous systems with multivariate Gaussian measurement models, demonstrates its application for a reinforcement learning based spacecraft maneuvering scenario, and shows how it can indicate deviations from expected behavior.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a closed-form solution to compute the surprise index (SI) for multivariate Gaussian observation models. Specifically, it shows that the SI can be calculated as the complementary cumulative distribution function of a chi-squared distribution. 

2. It validates the closed-form SI solution on a 2D GPS localization example and shows agreement with an empirical grid-based approximation from prior work.

3. It demonstrates an application of the closed-form SI to assess the validity and performance of a reinforcement learning-based nonlinear spacecraft maneuver planning policy. It uses the unscented transform to propagate uncertainty through the nonlinear dynamics and compute the SI.

4. The results on the spacecraft maneuver problem indicate that the SI can effectively detect when the spacecraft trajectory starts to deviate from the expected reference orbit. This shows the SI could be useful for online monitoring and competency assessment of autonomous control policies.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and demonstration of a closed-form SI solution for multivariate Gaussian models, including an application example assessing a "black box" reinforcement learning policy for spacecraft maneuver planning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Surprise index (SI): A measure to quantify how surprising/atypical a set of observations is compared to what a probabilistic model expects. Helps assess model validity.

- Multivariate Gaussian distribution: The paper shows that SI can be computed in closed form if the joint distribution of observations follows this distribution. 

- Mahalanobis distance: Used to define ordered regions of equal probability in the multivariate Gaussian case. Connects SI computation to chi-square hypothesis testing.

- Spacecraft maneuvering: Example application using reinforcement learning based policies for stationkeeping of unstable periodic orbits. SI used to detect deviations.  

- Sigma points: Method to propagate uncertainty through nonlinear system dynamics to compute statistics needed for SI.

- Model competency: Concept of whether model performance matches expectations. SI aims to provide a quantitative measure of this.

- Black box models: Machine learning models that are opaque to end users. Need methods like SI to validate them.

So in summary, the key focus is on using the surprise index to evaluate black box autonomy systems to ensure their competency, with a spacecraft maneuver example. The Gaussian case solution and connections to common statistical tests are also notable.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using the surprise index (SI) to assess the competency of autonomous systems, particularly when they rely on opaque machine learning models. Why is the SI well-suited for this task compared to other model quality measures like log-likelihood or entropy? 

2. The main contribution is deriving a closed-form solution for the SI under a multivariate Gaussian observation model. What is the significance of being able to compute the SI in closed-form compared to relying on sampling approximations? How does this connect SI to common filtering methods like Kalman filters?

3. The paper shows that ordered regions for integrating probability exist based on Mahalanobis distance contours. Intuitively explain why these contours delineate regions of equal probability density for a multivariate Gaussian.  

4. How exactly does the mapping between Mahalanobis distance and chi-squared distribution allow summing probability mass for the SI calculation? What is the interpretation of the chi-squared cdf value that results?

5. The SI validation example relies on a static 2D localization problem. How was the analytical SI solution verified against a grid-based empirical approximation? Why is an analytical solution preferred here?  

6. The paper generalizes the SI solution to linear dynamical systems. Walk through the steps to derive the marginal joint distribution over a sequence of Gaussian distributed measurements from such a system. 

7. Explain the need for using sigma points to propagate uncertainty through the nonlinear spacecraft dynamics. How do sigma points allow computing SI's dependence on measurement correlations? 

8. For the spacecraft test cases, what specifically was learned about the RL policy's performance from SI vs the reward signal used in training? How did SI indicate off-nominal behavior?

9. Discuss the computational challenges identified with using SI for long measurement histories. What approximations could make the calculation more tractable? 

10. The paper focuses narrowly on Gaussian measurement models. What other models might be amenable to analytical SI solutions? How could non-Gaussian cases be handled?
