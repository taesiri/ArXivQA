# [Aleth-NeRF: Illumination Adaptive NeRF with Concealing Field Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09093)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Aleth-NeRF, a novel method to train neural radiance fields (NeRF) on images captured under challenging lighting conditions like low-light or over-exposure and generate novel views under normal lighting. Inspired by ancient Greek emission theory which models vision as rays emitted from the eyes, the authors introduce the concept of a "Concealing Field" to account for attenuation of scene radiance along camera rays. Specifically, Aleth-NeRF models local and global concealing fields that reduce light transport to mimic dark or bright training images. During rendering, concealing fields are removed to boost emission for low-light scenes, or added to suppress over-emission for over-exposed scenes, thereby achieving unsupervised lightness correction. Experiments on a new multi-exposure dataset demonstrate Aleth-NeRF renders high quality normal-lit views from adverse training images, outperforming enhancement methods combined with NeRF. Key strengths are unsupervised end-to-end training without pre/post-processing steps, and more accurate novel view synthesis than comparable techniques. Limitations include less pronounced improvements on over-exposed scenes and some color inaccuracies. Overall, Aleth-NeRF advances NeRF's applicability to non-ideal capture conditions via a simple but effective concealing field assumption.
