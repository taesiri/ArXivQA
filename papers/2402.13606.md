# [A Comprehensive Study of Multilingual Confidence Estimation on Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13606)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing research on confidence estimation for large language models (LLMs) focuses only on English, which limits the development of reliable AI systems globally. 
- There is a lack of research investigating how confidence estimation methods perform across different languages and how scores could be improved via cross-lingual techniques.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct a high-quality multilingual question answering dataset across 10 languages - Mling-TriviaQA.
- Evaluate various confidence estimation methods on LLMs across languages to identify optimal approaches. 
- Use confidence scores as feedback to refine LLM answers across languages.  
- Propose cross-lingual confidence estimation leveraging scores from related languages to achieve better estimates.

Key Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of multilingual confidence estimation for LLMs towards advancing reliable AI systems globally.
- Introduced Mling-TriviaQA benchmark for multilingual confidence estimation research.  
- Identified self-verbalized numerical confidence as most effective method across languages.
- Showed confidence feedback consistently improves LLM performance across languages.
- Proposed cross-lingual confidence estimation outperforms monolingual and baseline methods for higher quality scores.

In summary, this paper significantly advances multilingual confidence estimation research for LLMs through analysis across languages, introduction of a novel benchmark, and proposal of an effective cross-lingual technique - delivering key progress towards globally reliable AI systems.
