# [A Summarized History-based Dialogue System for Amnesia-Free Prompt   Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Information overload makes it difficult for systems like travel agencies to provide optimal recommendations. Dialogue systems can help gather targeted information through conversations. 
- However, existing dialogue systems rely on pre-trained models and struggle to integrate real-time, comprehensive information. 
- Updating the system's knowledge through conversations causes it to lose memory of previous dialogues.

Proposed Solution:
- A dialogue system with dual storage - one for conversation history, another for summarized histories.
- When the system's prompt (background knowledge) is updated, the current conversation is summarized and integrated with past summarized histories.
- This retains memory while allowing prompt updates during conversations.

Contributions:  
- A novel dialogue system architecture that enables continuous prompt updates without losing memory of past conversations.
- Dual storage of full conversation history and iteratively generated summaries prevents memory overflow.
- Summaries seamlessly integrate details from current and past interactions when prompts are updated.
- Evaluated in a travel planning scenario - system showed improved satisfaction over baseline.

In summary, the paper proposes a method to update dialogue systems' knowledge on-the-fly through an intelligent dual storage and summarization mechanism. This significantly enhances existing dialogue systems' ability to integrate information and provide personalized recommendations.
