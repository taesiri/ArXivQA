## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel multi-view stereo network called CT-MVSNet for efficient and effective 3D reconstruction. The key innovation is the introduction of an adaptive matching-aware transformer (AMT) that employs different combinations of intra-attention and inter-attention blocks at each stage of the feature pyramid network to capture both local context within images and global relationships across images. To further enhance the stability and accuracy of cost volume construction, a dual-feature guided aggregation mechanism is presented to incorporate both coarse global semantics and fine local details. Additionally, a new feature metric loss is designed to ensure consistent and stable features across views after transformation. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component. Overall, by adaptively allocating transformers across multiple scales without excessive overhead, the proposed CT-MVSNet advances the capability of transformers and achieves an efficient balance between global context modeling and local detail preservation for high-quality 3D reconstruction.
