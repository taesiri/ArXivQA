# [Spatial-Temporal DAG Convolutional Networks for End-to-End Joint   Effective Connectivity Learning and Resting-State fMRI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time series classification either use a pre-defined correlation matrix as the brain connectivity, which is oversimplified, or learn the graph without any topology constraints, lacking interpretability. 
- Most methods for effective brain connectivity learning are unaware of the downstream classification task and cannot sufficiently exploit rs-fMRI label information.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Spatial-Temporal DAG Convolutional Network (ST-DAGCN) to jointly learn effective connectivity in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and classify rs-fMRI time series.
- Design spatial-temporal DAG convolution layer consisting of DAG convolution to capture causal dependencies among brain regions and 1D convolution to exploit temporal dynamics.
- Formulate optimization problem with score function combining classification loss and graph sparsity regularization to search for optimal DAG. Solve via augmented Lagrangian and gradient descent.

Main Contributions:
- Achieve improved classification performance over state-of-the-art methods on two public rs-fMRI datasets. 
- Jointly optimize effective connectivity and model parameters in an end-to-end manner, with the downstream task providing supervised information.
- Learn meaningful connectivity patterns that provide interpretability to understand brain activity and disease.
- Discover biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease by comparing connectivity differences between patients and controls.

In summary, the paper proposes an end-to-end framework to simultaneously classify rs-fMRI data and infer interpretable effective brain connectivity, outperforming previous works on both tasks. The estimated connectivity also discloses valuable insights into brain functional mechanisms.
