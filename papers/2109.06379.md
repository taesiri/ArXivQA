# Compression, Transduction, and Creation: A Unified Framework for   Evaluating Natural Language Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is: A unified perspective based on information change from input to output can facilitate the design of effective and interpretable evaluation metrics across diverse natural language generation tasks.In particular, the key claims are:1) NLG tasks can be categorized into compression, transduction and creation based on how information changes from input to output. 2) The concept of information alignment, measuring the overlap between input, output, context etc., plays a central role in characterizing the quality of generation across tasks.3) Metrics designed based on information alignment can achieve strong correlation with human judgements of quality for key aspects of various NLG tasks.4) A single accurate alignment prediction model benefits metrics for multiple tasks/aspects.So in summary, the paper proposes and validates a framework based on information change and alignment that provides a unified perspective for developing and improving NLG evaluation metrics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified framework for evaluating various natural language generation (NLG) tasks based on the concept of information alignment. The key points are:- It categorizes NLG tasks into compression, transduction and creation based on how information changes from input to output. - It proposes that information alignment, defined as the overlap between the information in different components like input, output and context, is a core concept connecting evaluation across diverse NLG tasks. - It demonstrates the framework by devising intuitive metrics for key aspects of summarization, style transfer and dialog tasks purely based on measuring information alignment. - The metrics are shown to achieve strong correlation with human judgments, often outperforming prior specialized metrics designed individually for each task.- The framework offers a systematic way to design and improve evaluation metrics by improving the underlying information alignment estimation. It also provides interpretability by examining the token-level alignments.In summary, the paper presents a principled and unified perspective for tackling the challenging problem of automatic NLG evaluation across different tasks. The information-alignment based techniques formulate effective metrics and also open up possibilities for modular and composable NLG systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a unified framework for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems across different tasks. The key contributions are:- Proposes categorizing NLG tasks into compression, transduction, and creation based on how information changes from input to output. - Identifies information alignment between input, output, and context as a common underlying concept for defining evaluation metrics across diverse NLG tasks.- Develops a family of interpretable metrics for key aspects of summarization, style transfer, and dialog systems using information alignment. The metrics achieve strong empirical performance.This framework differs from prior NLG evaluation research in a few key ways:- Most prior metrics focus on a single task like summarization or dialog. This paper provides a general methodology for designing metrics across tasks. - Previous frameworks have categorized quality aspects within individual tasks. This paper identifies commonalities across tasks using the lens of information change.- Many metrics rely on heuristics or loose connections to desired qualities. This work grounds metric design in the concrete concept of information alignment.- The paper delivers a small library of reusable, high-performing metrics for common aspects, enabled by the unified alignment-based view.Overall, this work moves towards more structured, composable, and rigorous practices for NLG evaluation. The alignment-based perspective and resulting metric designs are novel contributions compared to prior fragmented evaluation research. The unified viewpoint and strong empirical results on multiple tasks help advance the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few promising future research directions in the concluding section of the paper:- The unified framework can be used to design new metrics for emerging NLG tasks and quality aspects. The concept of information alignment provides structured guidance for developing interpretable metrics.- The modular framework opens up possibilities for more composable NLG evaluation, treating components like alignment estimation as interchangeable modules. This is analogous to software engineering practices. Modules can be improved, scaled, and diagnosed independently. - The alignment estimation model is currently the main bottleneck in the framework. Improving alignment prediction, such as exploring new training signals and model architectures, will directly benefit metric accuracy across diverse tasks.- The current work focuses on text-based tasks. The framework can be extended to multimodal NLG involving images, tables, etc. by developing cross-modal alignment estimation.- The alignment framework provides an "intermediate representation" for comparing different metrics. More theoretical analysis can be done to characterize metric properties based on this common ground.- While mainly studying common NLG aspects, the framework can be used to design metrics for more fine-grained attributes like personality and argument strength.- The interpretability of token-level alignments can be utilized for deeper understanding of model behaviors, like error analyses.In summary, the authors laid out a generalizable evaluation methodology and discussed many promising future work building on top of it, including improving alignment prediction, applying the framework to new modalities/tasks/aspects, leveraging alignment for deeper understanding of models, and developing more theoretical grounding.
