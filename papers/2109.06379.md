# [Compression, Transduction, and Creation: A Unified Framework for   Evaluating Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06379)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is: 

A unified perspective based on information change from input to output can facilitate the design of effective and interpretable evaluation metrics across diverse natural language generation tasks.

In particular, the key claims are:

1) NLG tasks can be categorized into compression, transduction and creation based on how information changes from input to output. 

2) The concept of information alignment, measuring the overlap between input, output, context etc., plays a central role in characterizing the quality of generation across tasks.

3) Metrics designed based on information alignment can achieve strong correlation with human judgements of quality for key aspects of various NLG tasks.

4) A single accurate alignment prediction model benefits metrics for multiple tasks/aspects.

So in summary, the paper proposes and validates a framework based on information change and alignment that provides a unified perspective for developing and improving NLG evaluation metrics.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a unified framework for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems across different tasks. The key contributions are:

- Proposes categorizing NLG tasks into compression, transduction, and creation based on how information changes from input to output. 

- Identifies information alignment between input, output, and context as a common underlying concept for defining evaluation metrics across diverse NLG tasks.

- Develops a family of interpretable metrics for key aspects of summarization, style transfer, and dialog systems using information alignment. The metrics achieve strong empirical performance.

This framework differs from prior NLG evaluation research in a few key ways:

- Most prior metrics focus on a single task like summarization or dialog. This paper provides a general methodology for designing metrics across tasks. 

- Previous frameworks have categorized quality aspects within individual tasks. This paper identifies commonalities across tasks using the lens of information change.

- Many metrics rely on heuristics or loose connections to desired qualities. This work grounds metric design in the concrete concept of information alignment.

- The paper delivers a small library of reusable, high-performing metrics for common aspects, enabled by the unified alignment-based view.

Overall, this work moves towards more structured, composable, and rigorous practices for NLG evaluation. The alignment-based perspective and resulting metric designs are novel contributions compared to prior fragmented evaluation research. The unified viewpoint and strong empirical results on multiple tasks help advance the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few promising future research directions in the concluding section of the paper:

- The unified framework can be used to design new metrics for emerging NLG tasks and quality aspects. The concept of information alignment provides structured guidance for developing interpretable metrics.

- The modular framework opens up possibilities for more composable NLG evaluation, treating components like alignment estimation as interchangeable modules. This is analogous to software engineering practices. Modules can be improved, scaled, and diagnosed independently. 

- The alignment estimation model is currently the main bottleneck in the framework. Improving alignment prediction, such as exploring new training signals and model architectures, will directly benefit metric accuracy across diverse tasks.

- The current work focuses on text-based tasks. The framework can be extended to multimodal NLG involving images, tables, etc. by developing cross-modal alignment estimation.

- The alignment framework provides an "intermediate representation" for comparing different metrics. More theoretical analysis can be done to characterize metric properties based on this common ground.

- While mainly studying common NLG aspects, the framework can be used to design metrics for more fine-grained attributes like personality and argument strength.

- The interpretability of token-level alignments can be utilized for deeper understanding of model behaviors, like error analyses.

In summary, the authors laid out a generalizable evaluation methodology and discussed many promising future work building on top of it, including improving alignment prediction, applying the framework to new modalities/tasks/aspects, leveraging alignment for deeper understanding of models, and developing more theoretical grounding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified framework for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) tasks based on the concept of information alignment. NLG tasks are categorized into compression, transduction, and creation. In compression tasks like summarization, the output text should be consistent with and contain the most relevant information from the input text. In transduction tasks like style transfer, the output should preserve all the content from the input while changing the style. In creation tasks like dialog, the output should create new information that engages with the input context and incorporates external knowledge. 

The key idea is that information alignment, or the overlap between the input, output, and any additional context, underlies the quality of generation. The paper shows how metrics for key aspects of diverse tasks, including relevance and consistency in summarization, content preservation in style transfer, and engagingness and groundedness in dialog, can be defined based on aggregating token-level information alignment scores. The alignment scores are computed using contextualized language models. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed metrics achieve stronger correlation with human judgments compared to prior specialized metrics designed individually for each task. The unified alignment-based perspective facilitates interpretable evaluation and metric design across NLG applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a unified framework for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems across diverse tasks like summarization, style transfer, and dialog. The key idea is to categorize NLG tasks into compression, transduction, and creation based on how information changes from input to output. The paper argues that measuring the alignment or overlap of information between input, output, and any additional context is essential for characterizing the quality of generation across tasks. 

The paper presents a general definition of token-level, soft information alignment between two pieces of text. It then shows how metrics for key aspects of summarization, style transfer, and dialog can be devised in terms of aggregating the token alignments. For example, a summary's consistency is measured by aligning it with the source text, and relevance by also incorporating reference alignments.

To operationalize the framework, the paper trains neural models to estimate the token-level alignments in a self-supervised manner, using perturbations and paraphrasing of in-domain text. The proposed metrics mostly outperform previous specialized metrics in correlating with human judgments, highlighting the versatility of the alignment-based framework. Overall, the paper delivers a unifying perspective to NLG evaluation and composable building blocks for easy metric design.
