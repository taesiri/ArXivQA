# [Single-Stage Diffusion NeRF: A Unified Approach to 3D Generation and   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06714)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we develop a unified framework that achieves strong performance on diverse 3D tasks, including unconditional generation, sparse-view reconstruction, and dense-view reconstruction?More specifically, the paper proposes a model called Single-Stage Diffusion NeRF (SSDNeRF) that combines a neural radiance field (NeRF) representation with a latent diffusion model in order to achieve all-round performance on the aforementioned tasks within a single framework. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing a novel single-stage training paradigm that jointly optimizes a NeRF auto-decoder and a latent diffusion model from multi-view images. This allows simultaneous 3D reconstruction and prior learning.- Developing a guidance-finetuning sampling scheme to exploit the learned diffusion priors for flexible 3D reconstruction from an arbitrary number of views at test time.- Demonstrating that the proposed SSDNeRF model achieves strong performance comparable to or better than leading task-specific methods in unconditional generation, sparse-view reconstruction, and dense-view reconstruction.So in summary, the central research question is how to develop a unified 3D framework by combining NeRF and diffusion models, and the key proposal is the single-stage training approach to jointly learn reconstruction and generation abilities. Experiments demonstrate SSDNeRF's effectiveness on diverse tasks compared to previous specialized methods.
