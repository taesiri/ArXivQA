# [Model Extraction Attacks Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05386)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Model extraction (ME) attacks pose a major threat to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms by extracting the functionality of proprietary ML models through querying black-box APIs. It is unclear how the vulnerability of MLaaS platforms to such attacks has evolved over time given the advances in both attacks and defenses. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper designs and implements an open-source platform called MeBench to evaluate the ME vulnerability of MLaaS APIs. MeBench integrates various ME attacks, metrics, models and datasets to characterize vulnerability from multiple perspectives. It also enables analyzing the evolution of vulnerability using historical datasets spanning years.

Main Contributions:

- Empirical evaluation shows commercial MLaaS APIs still exhibit high vulnerability to ME attacks. The extent varies across tasks, datasets and platforms.

- Study of attack parameters indicates factors like optimizers significantly impact attacks while advanced models provide limited gains. Many findings challenge previous conclusions drawn in controlled settings.  

- Retrospective analysis over years uncovers evolutions in ME vulnerability for some APIs, suggesting potential lack of investment in defenses. No clear vulnerability reduction is observed.

- Various suggestions provided about improving MLaaS security against ME attacks. The study sheds light on the current state of real-world ME vulnerability and future research directions.

In summary, this is the first work comprehensively evaluating and analyzing the ME vulnerability of commercial MLaaS platforms over time. It leads to interesting findings about the vulnerability status quo and evolution, while highlighting the necessity for proactive defenses.
