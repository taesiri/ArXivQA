# [Multimodal Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06512)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Predicting clinical trial outcomes is crucial to reduce costs and exclude drugs likely to fail, but remains challenging. 
- Existing methods rely on manually designed modality-specific encoders, limiting extensibility and cross-modality information sharing.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose LIFTED, a multimodal mixture-of-experts approach.  
- Unifies modalities by transforming data to natural language descriptions using large language models. Enables unified encoding.
- Employs noise-resilient encoders and sparse mixture-of-experts framework to extract and refine representations. Matches information patterns across modalities.  
- Integrates representations dynamically with a mixture-of-experts module. Automatically weighs modalities.

Main Contributions:
- Unified encoding of multimodal clinical trial data as natural language descriptions.
- Noise-resilient sparse mixture-of-experts framework to extract and refine unified representations.
- Dynamic mixture-of-experts integration to weigh modality importance per sample.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on clinical trial outcome prediction across all phases.

In summary, the key innovation is the unified multimodal encoding and dynamic integration approach, outperforming specialized encoders. The method contributes to reduced costs and faster drug development through improved clinical trial outcome prediction.
