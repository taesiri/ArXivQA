# [Space Time Recurrent Memory Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06474)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an efficient visual memory network architecture that can handle long sequences in spatial-temporal domains while maintaining a constant memory size?The key points are:- The paper proposes a novel recurrent memory network called Space-Time Recurrent Memory Network (STReMN) for spatio-temporal reasoning tasks. - Unlike prior approaches like convolutional LSTMs or Transformers, the proposed model maintains a fixed number of memory slots rather than allowing memory to grow linearly with sequence length.- This allows the model to efficiently process long video sequences while keeping memory requirements constant.- The core novelty is a learned memory update mechanism based on Gumbel softmax that decides which memory slot to update at each time step.- The model is evaluated on video object segmentation and video prediction tasks, achieving strong results compared to prior work while using constant memory.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that we can design an efficient constant-size visual memory architecture that performs well on long spatial-temporal reasoning tasks by learning to selectively update memory slots. The experiments aim to validate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel space-time memory network architecture with a fixed number of memory slots. This allows efficient online processing for spatio-temporal reasoning without increasing memory size as the length of the video grows.- Introducing a memory update module based on Gumbel-Softmax attention that learns to select which memory slot to update with new input information. This avoids having to manually design memory update rules.- Evaluating the proposed memory model on video object segmentation and video prediction tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art results on DAVIS 2017 for video object segmentation and outperforms prior memory-based models on video prediction.- Presenting analyses and ablation studies that provide insights into the learned memory update behaviors and demonstrate benefits over baseline update strategies.In summary, the main novelty seems to be the proposed space-time recurrent memory network architecture that maintains a constant memory size and learns to effectively update memory slots for spatio-temporal reasoning tasks. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities on problems like video object segmentation and prediction.
