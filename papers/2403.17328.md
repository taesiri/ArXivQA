# [Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods for traffic signal control (TSC) have two key issues: (1) designing effective rewards requires significant domain expertise, (2) the learned policies are complex neural networks lacking explainability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a genetic programming (GP) based method called GPLight to evolve explainable and effective traffic signal control strategies. 

- It introduces the concept of "phase urgency" to evaluate the priority of activating each traffic signal phase. The phase urgency is calculated by an "urgency function", which is represented as a tree structure in GP.

- GPLight evolves good urgency functions that can select the most suitable traffic signal phase to activate based on real-time traffic conditions. The fitness evaluation is based on directly simulating traffic flows and measuring vehicular travel time, removing the need for intricate reward engineering.

Main Contributions:
- A GP approach to learn interpretable TSC strategies, requiring no complex reward design. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first application of GP for TSC in complex 8-phase multi-intersection scenarios.

- Experiments in multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate GPLight outperforms both a state-of-the-art transportation method and a DRL method. The evolved urgency functions are explainable mathematical expressions.

- Both high solution quality and model explainability are achieved through symbolic tree representations, indicating GP's potential as an alternative to DRL for TSC problems.
