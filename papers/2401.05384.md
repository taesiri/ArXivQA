# [From Good to Great: Improving Math Reasoning with Tool-Augmented   Interleaf Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05384)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT still struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving. They are prone to making mistakes during intermediate calculations.
- Incorporating external tools like calculators can help mitigate errors, but tool-augmented LLMs don't always outperform regular LLMs. There is still room for improvement.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes IMP-TIP, a framework to combine the strengths of both regular LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs to enhance performance on math reasoning tasks. 
- It has two key components:
  1) Self-prompt: Allows LLMs to iteratively refine tool-based prompts to make them clearer, more diverse, and machine-friendly without manual effort.
  2) Tool-augmented Interleaf Prompting (TIP): Derives the final answer in an interleaved manner by analyzing the problem, cross-checking potential solutions from both LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs, revising reasoning hints, and calling tools.

Main Contributions:
- In-depth analysis comparing LLMs-COT and tool-augmented LLMs, motivating the need for IMP-TIP
- Introduction of self-prompt method to automate prompt engineering 
- Design of TIP method combining reasoning, acting and tools interactively
- Experiments showing IMP-TIP significantly improves performance of LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs on 5 math reasoning datasets

In summary, the paper presents a novel framework to enhance LLMs' mathematical capabilities by capitalizing on both their innate reasoning strengths and external tools' calculation accuracies in an interleaved prompting manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces IMP-TIP, a framework that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and tool-augmented LLMs to enhance performance on complex math reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing IMP-TIP, a framework that combines the strengths of both large language models (LLMs) and tool-augmented LLMs to enhance performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes "self-prompt" to automatically generate diverse and effective tool-based prompts for LLMs without requiring manual effort. This elicits varied reasoning paths and solutions from the LLMs.

2) The paper introduces "tool-augmented interleaf prompting" (TIP), which allows LLMs to derive the final answer to a math problem by dynamically analyzing the problem, cross-checking potential solutions (from both regular LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs), and revising previous reasoning hints in an interleaved manner. 

3) Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that IMP-TIP significantly improves performance over traditional LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs on multiple math reasoning datasets. For instance, IMP-TIP improves tool-augmented ChatGPT's accuracy on the GSM8K-Hard dataset from 56.0% to 65.2%.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel IMP-TIP framework that capitalizes on both regular and tool-augmented LLMs to enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities. The key aspects are the self-prompt and tool-augmented interleaf prompting methods.
