# [NeuralLift-360: Lifting An In-the-wild 2D Photo to A 3D Object with   360° Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16431)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

How can we lift a single 2D image into a 3D object that allows generating photorealistic novel views from any viewing angle (i.e. 360 degree views)?

The key hypothesis is that by combining neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with denoising diffusion models, it is possible to reconstruct a plausible 3D object from a single image that can render high-quality 360 degree novel views. 

Specifically, the paper proposes that:

- NeRFs can provide a useful 3D scene representation. 

- Diffusion models can provide strong priors and hallucinate plausible unseen views.

- With proper training techniques like a ranking loss and CLIP-guidance, even very rough depth estimation can suffice to create compelling 3D objects from single images.

So in summary, the central research question is how to lift a single 2D photo to a 3D object with 360 degree novel views. The key hypothesis is that combining NeRFs and diffusion models in the right way can achieve this goal.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of lifting 2D images to 3D:

- It focuses on a more challenging task of generating a full 360 degree 3D object from a single image, compared to prior works that only generate limited views or require multiple input views. Most prior works focus on faces, toys, or synthetic datasets, while this aims for general real-world objects.

- It proposes a novel framework NeuralLift-360 that combines neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with diffusion model priors to generate the 3D object. This differs from previous hybrid approaches using depth estimation or 3D datasets. It is most similar to SinNeRF in using NeRF with limited input, but goes further with the diffusion prior.

- The method introduces a ranking loss for supervision from rough depth maps, making it more robust to poor depth estimation compared to methods like SinNeRF. This helps extend to real images where consistent depth is unavailable.

- It finetunes the diffusion model on the input image to adapt the prior specifically to that image, unlike general text-to-image priors used before. This better tailors the prior to the given image.

- Experiments demonstrate stronger performance on real images over baselines, showcasing the robustness and generalization of NeuralLift-360. The qualitative results showing coherent 360 views are more sophisticated than prior works on real images.

Overall, this paper pushes the boundary on single image 3D lifting with a novel framework and losses tailored for real images. The diffusion prior and depth ranking supervision appear to be key innovations that allow generating more complete 3D objects from limited real image input.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Expanding the method to more general scenarios with multiple objects and occlusions. The current method focuses on single object reconstruction. Handling more complex scenes with multiple objects that may occlude each other is noted as a limitation.

- Improving the target resolution. The authors note the current resolution of 128x128 is limited compared to state-of-the-art generative models that can synthesize higher resolution images. Exploring ways to increase the output resolution is suggested. 

- Leveraging more advanced generative models. The framework is demonstrated with Stable Diffusion v1.4 but the authors suggest it could also be applied to other diffusion models like Imagen or DALL-E2 once they are open-sourced. Utilizing advances in these generative models is a future direction.

- Generalizing to real image datasets. While experiments on both synthetic and real images are shown, applying the method to large datasets of real images is noted as an interesting research problem. 

- Reducing computation costs. The authors note the method currently requires heavy computation, so reducing the computational and memory burdens could enable broader applications.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the generality and scalability of the approach, improving the image quality and resolution, and leveraging advances in generative diffusion models. Advancing research along these fronts could further enhance the practical utility of the method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called NeuralLift-360 for lifting a single 2D image into a 3D object with 360° views. The key idea is to combine neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with denoising diffusion models (DDMs). The NeRF provides a continuous 3D scene representation that can render novel views. The DDM acts as a prior to hallucinate plausible unseen views and guide the NeRF training. To handle in-the-wild images, the DDM is finetuned on the input image while maintaining diversity. A ranking loss based on rough depth estimation is used to provide weak geometry supervision. Experiments show NeuralLift-360 can generate high-quality 3D objects with 360° views from a single image, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The method sheds light on automating 3D content creation from 2D images.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called NeuralLift-360 for lifting a single in-the-wild 2D photo into a 3D object with 360-degree views. The key challenge is that the content on the backside of the object is hidden and hard to hallucinate. To address this, the authors utilize diffusion model priors together with monocular depth estimation as cues for hallucination. The framework combines a neural radiance field (NeRF) representation with a denoising diffusion model to generate plausible 3D consistent views. It introduces a ranking loss that provides supervision from rough depth estimation and helps mitigate errors. The method also uses a CLIP-guided sampling strategy to provide coherent guidance to the diffusion process. Experiments demonstrate the approach significantly outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis from a single image on both synthetic and real-world examples.

In more detail, the NeuralLift-360 framework combines the strengths of NeRF for scene representation and diffusion models for learning priors. The training loss consists of a photometric term on the input view, a diffusion model prior loss for other views, and a ranking loss for rough depth guidance. The diffusion process uses a CLIP similarity metric to relate generated views to the input image. To adapt to real images, the diffusion model is fine-tuned on the single input photo while preserving diversity. The ranking loss from rough depth estimation provides scale-invariant supervision to overcome instability of monocular depth. Results show NeuralLift-360 can take a single image of an object and generate compelling 360 degree views. The method demonstrates new state-of-the-art performance on the extremely challenging task of novel view synthesis from a single in-the-wild image.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel framework called NeuralLift-360 for lifting a single 2D image into a 3D object with 360-degree novel views. The key ideas are:

1. They adopt a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the 3D scene representation and train it using a single input view. 

2. They incorporate the strong generative prior from denoising diffusion models to complement the missing 3D information. Specifically, they derive a diffusion prior loss to regularize the NeRF training in a probabilistic framework. 

3. They use CLIP guidance in the diffusion prior to encourage semantic consistency between the rendered images and the reference image. The diffusion model is also finetuned on the reference image to adapt to real-world images.

4. They use the relative ranking information from rough depth estimation, instead of the absolute depth value, as weak supervision. This makes the method more robust to noise in the depth input.

5. The full method combines the NeRF representation, diffusion prior regularization, CLIP guidance, depth ranking loss, and other best practices to lift a single 2D photo to a high-quality 3D object with 360 degree novel views.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is trying to address is how to lift a single 2D image into a 3D object that can be viewed from 360 degrees. In other words, the goal is to take a single image as input, and generate a full 3D model of the object in the image that allows synthesizing novel views of the object from any angle. 

Some more specific challenges and questions the paper tries to tackle:

- How to generate plausible unseen views of an object given only a single image, when the backside and occluded parts are not visible in the input image? This requires hallucinating reasonable geometry and texture for the invisible parts.

- How to overcome the limitations of prior work like pixelNeRF that require large datasets of 3D objects, and do not generalize well to arbitrary natural images?

- How to deal with the fact that depth maps predicted from monocular depth estimators are often not accurate enough in scale to reconstruct high-quality 3D geometry?

- How to incorporate useful priors and regularization to generate geometrically reasonable 3D objects rather than arbitrary warped shapes that still match the input view?

- How to leverage recent advances in generative models like diffusion models to provide useful priors for generating the invisible parts of the 3D object?

So in summary, the key goal is taking single-view image to 360-degree 3D object, using ideas like NeRF representations, diffusion model priors, and more robust training to deal with real-world data lacking perfect ground truth depth maps.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) - The paper utilizes NeRF as the 3D scene representation. NeRF is a neural implicit representation that can synthesize novel views of a scene.

- Denoising Diffusion Models - The paper uses diffusion models as priors to provide guidance and regularization for synthesizing unseen views. Diffusion models can generate high-quality images from noise through a denoising process. 

- Single-view 3D reconstruction - The paper focuses on reconstructing a 3D object and generating 360 degree novel views from only a single input image. This is more challenging than multi-view 3D reconstruction.

- CLIP guidance - CLIP, a contrastive language-image model, is used to provide semantic guidance. The CLIP image embeddings are matched between the rendered images and reference image.

- Depth ranking loss - Instead of supervising with absolute depth values, a ranking loss based on relative depth relationships is used. This makes the approach more robust to inaccurate depth estimations.

- Domain adaptation - The diffusion model is finetuned on the reference image to adapt it to in-the-wild images and provide more accurate guidance.

- 360 degree novel view synthesis - The key goal is to generate plausible views of the 3D object from any viewing angle up to 360 degrees.

In summary, the key focus is using NeRF with diffusion prior regularization and CLIP guidance to perform single-view 3D reconstruction and 360 degree novel view synthesis in the wild. The depth ranking loss and domain adaptation techniques help improve the approach's applicability.
